You don\u2019t gain a lot in terms of resolution, so upscaling stuff captured in 1080p doesn\u2019t give you much. It does give you a little in terms of the creators being in charge of the upscale (for better or worse) instead of the TV.  You also gain a little bitrate. Normal blurays cap out at 40ish mbps whereas 4K blurays go up to 120ish. (For reference, raw camera footage from an Arri Alexa is ~1200mpbs. And they only do 3.2K, not 4K. Netflix 1080p streams are like... 8-10 mpbs.)\n\nIt also depends a lot on the upscale. Some upscales do look pretty good, and it allows the creators to do a new color pass with HDR if they want. \n\nNow... Can you tell the difference? Is it worth it? Probably not, especially on a normal-sized TV. On the flipside, there are movies that were actually captured in higher resolution that are really lazily remastered in 4K and don\u2019t look at all better than their 1080p release. \n\nTLDR: It\u2019s confusing.
