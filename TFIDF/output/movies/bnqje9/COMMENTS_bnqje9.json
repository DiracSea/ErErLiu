Most thought that if he were to escape, he'd first go to Italy to gain support before making his way into France. They thought he'd be foolish to escape to France and would probably be killed the moment he stepped foot on shore.\n\nSo, Nappy is marching towards Paris and his troops come face to face with the Royalist troops. There's a standoff. Guns are pointed at one another. Nappy walks out into the middle, opens his coat and says \"know me, I am your Emperor. If any one of you wishes to shoot his emperor, here I am!\"\n\nThere was silence. One dude actually did yell \"fire.\" May have been akward for him later on, because another dude yelled \"long live the Emperor!\" Both sides erupted in cheers. They swarmed him, laughing and crying, and marched onto Paris.\n\nAnother funny thing about this march was the newspaper headlines at the time. Initially, when he first got back to France, the papers had headlines like \"The Corsican ogre means to retake the throne!\" Yet as he got closer closer, the headlines lightened up on their tone. Then, they eventually switched to saying \"long live the Emperor!\" By the time he was just outside of Paris.\n\nHe's one of my favorite figures. I'm not sure if I love him or hate him either. He's such a grey character and he shaped a lot of massive events. All the great powers teamed up against him in several different coalitions to stop him. Seemingly afraid that their hereditary monarchies were in danger. He was influenced by the French Revolution as a young artillery officer at the time. He carried those ideals, yet also seemed to fall into the trap of \"absolute power corrupts absolutely.\"\n\nBefore Waterloo, after he returned to power, he had a lot of push back on conscription. The French were sick of sending their sons to die in some foreign battlefield. He sent quite a lot of people to their death in the pursuit of glory and expanding his empire.

Nevertheless, they knew I was just starting in the entertainment industry as an Assistant Director and Editor.  My relative, being from the older set of filmmakers sent me a Napoleon script that, at the time, was something of a pet project for a well established A list actor who's identity was kept from me.  I did not recognize the writer, but I read the script.  It was ambitious, and it needed a lot of work, very heady, very long, lots of imagery.  It read like a Terence Malik film.  Honestly I didn't really enjoy reading it.  Somewhat unceremoniously I finished reading it on the toilet.  I placed the script on top of an old pile of car magazines that I keep in the bathroom.  It sat there for a year and eventually I lost track of it, as it got buried under magazines and perhaps recycled en masse.  That was a LONG time ago and the movie was never made.  Later I found out that Ridley Scott was once attached to perhaps direct it and that the writer's name was changed on the script for secrecy's sake.

To begin with, he fascinates me. His life has been described as an epic poem of action. His sex life was worthy of Arthur Schnitzler. He was one of those rare men who move history and mold the destiny of their own times and of generations to come -- in a very concrete sense, our own world is the result of Napoleon, just as the political and geographic map of postwar Europe is the result of World War Two. And, of course, there has never been a good or accurate movie about him. Also, I find that all the issues with which it concerns itself are oddly contemporary -- the responsibilities and abuses of power, the dynamics of social revolution, the relationship of the individual to the state, war, militarism, etc., so this will not be just a dusty historic pageant but a film about the basic questions of our own times, as well as Napoleon's.

However, they did have a different version that was similar, but without the blue stripe on the left side of the flag, and the symbols on each triangle had faces on them. \n\nWales-\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Wales\n\nThe flag depicted shows the design that was adopted in 1953, whereas in 1914, the flag would have had a solid white background (instead of the green bar on the lower half) with the dragon standing on a little patch of grass. \n\nMexico-\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Mexico\n\nThis one is pretty close, but again, incorrect. The flag adopted from 1893-1916 had the eagle in the center with its wings spread out instead of being in the hunched sort of position as we know it today. The flag would go through 2 different changes from 1916 to 1968 when it was finalized as the one we know today.\n\nRomania-\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Romania\n\n(Sidenote: this could also be Chad\u2019s flag, but I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s Romania, as their flag has a lighter shade of blue than Chad\u2019s, the former being more \u201ccobalt\u201d, and the latter being more \u201cindigo.\u201d)\n\nRomania actually checks out. They have had changes to it since, but the present flag and the one it would be in 1914 are similar enough.\n\nItaly- \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Italy\n\nItaly was a monarchy in 1914, so while they had the tricolor, it would have had a royal crest in the center. The tricolor we know today would only be adopted after the fall of fascist Italy after WWII. \n\nPoland-\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Poland\n\nOof, this one hurts. Poland wasn\u2019t an independent country in 1914. As is tradition, Poland was partitioned between many other nations, this instance being between Germany, Russia and the Austro-Hungarian Empires. As such, they didn\u2019t really... have a flag... not having existed.\nNow, Poland wasn\u2019t a new concept at this point; it had been around centuries prior. Many of the people who lived in the area of present-day Poland in 1914 would likely identify as being \u201cPolish\u201d. However, the 2 color flag probably wouldn\u2019t be the symbol they\u2019d identify with. They\u2019d probably think of the polish coat of arms. (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coat_of_arms_of_Poland)\n\nSwitzerland-\n\n(You can just barely see this in the following shot on the left)\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Switzerland\n\nThis one is actually accurate as well, being adopted in 1889 when the final dimensions were set. \n\nSide note: at 0:34, you can see Milo\u2019s hand go over the replaced flag. (That one is solid green, maybe Libya? That\u2019s another story though, this movie was made in 2001, and the Libyan flag was solid green from 1977-2011. In 1914, Libya would have been an Italian colony, so it\u2019s flag would just be Italy\u2019s).\n\nLiterally unwatchable.\n\n(Obligatory r/vexillology plug)", "created_utc": 1557690256.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "en8vbk7", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_bnqje9", "parent_id": "t1_en8ep6u", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/bnqje9/stanley_kubricks_napoleon_the_greatest_movie/en8vbk7/", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "GeneralMoron", "author_id": "lga42", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "From the article\n\n> I want you to go,\" he told him, even getting him to bring back samples of earth from Waterloo so he could match them for the screen.", "created_utc": 1557687374.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "en8prpa", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_bnqje9", "parent_id": "t1_en8l0ah", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/bnqje9/stanley_kubricks_napoleon_the_greatest_movie/en8prpa/", "score": 8, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Fr4t", "author_id": "60u8i", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "To rub dirt on his hands like Maximus before each take", "created_utc": 1557692303.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "en8ziyi", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_bnqje9", "parent_id": "t1_en8l0ah", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/bnqje9/stanley_kubricks_napoleon_the_greatest_movie/en8ziyi/", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Turdy_Toots", "author_id": "3ql1il4w", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Great!  looks smaller and cheaper than the first giant book :)", "created_utc": 1557684324.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "en8karo", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_bnqje9", "parent_id": "t1_en8jp2y", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/bnqje9/stanley_kubricks_napoleon_the_greatest_movie/en8karo/", "score": 50, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "kck2018", "author_id": "1dixzl77", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Thank you.

I hate when people pretend it isn't. \n\nI don't mean to accuse here, but invariably when someone talks shit about Titanic it's either because they don't know a thing about filmmaking at all, or, they're just an insecure straight guy and can't bring themselves to admit romance films can be really, really good. Invariably these people also think The Notebook is a \"boring chick flick\" too (spoiler, that's also a *really good* movie). \n\nYes, Titanic is a fairly generic Cinderella tragedy/romance (DiCaprio being Cinderella). Many great films are done with fairly generic concepts and ideas though. That ship too, had many many movies made about it before Cameron's edition. That part is generic too. But the thing about greatness is that it is best seen in something normal, recognizable, and generic. Look at the Beatles. They were incredibly generic, but it's that genericism that let us really see the range of what those artists could do. If it wasn't generic, the genius wouldn't be so recognizable. And the thing about genius is that it's nothing without recognition. What good is the best film ever made if it's some niche piece only ten people in the world understand? How could you even consider it \"the best\"? Generic isn't a bad thing. \n\nTaken all together, Titanic is a legitimate masterpiece in the art of filmmaking as a storytelling medium. \n\nThe production, the direction, the casting, the actors, the level of depth they got out of so many small characters (Billy Zane, Kathy Bates among many many more), the sets, the lighting, the score, even the color used throughout: it was all truly quite phenomenal. Even with how great the acting was? They could've had an entirely different cast. No one in that movie was irreplaceable. Still would've worked wonders. When no actor on screen is \"necessary\", the film couldn't do without - - and the acting is still great? You know you're watching a really amazing director practice their craft. And Best Picture is an award given to the director and production team. That's what the award is about. \n\nSorry for the rant. Lazy afternoon here. But it is a remarkably well made movie that absolutely deserved Best Picture, none of those other films come close (despite all being great films in their own right). The fact that it was also a financial juggernaut of a success story is just icing on the cake: it was so successful *because* it was so friggin good. I mean honestly the biggest flaw was how doofy Bill Paxton is. He was the only weak link in that whole movie, but it almost worked in the movie's favor: every time he was on screen (modern era cuts), you just could not *wait* for him to get off so they'd cut back to the story. That's a fairly well understood storytelling technique (cutting back to the narrator hearing the story from someone).
