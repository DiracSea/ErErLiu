However  \"Reputation management services\" or other bullshit pseudonyms is commonly sold business on social media.  It's just an evolution of the old school \"[plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shill)\" you'd sit in audiences for acts/movies/shows/performances.  Most people say shill now, but that word is so overused it's been devalued so I don't like using it.   [Astroturfing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroturfing) is another good term for it, though usually (but not always) that's used when politics is involved.    \n\n**But let's get into the meat of things:**  \n\n &nbsp;\n\n- Straight from a paid Oil plant:  https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/31wo57/the_chevron_tapes_video_shows_oil_giant_allegedly/cq5uhse/\n\n- https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2017/02/20/reddit-is-being-manipulated-by-big-financial-services-companies/#642506524c92  \n\n- https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/5vxxyh/reddit_is_being_regularly_manipulated_by_large/de5uy8j/  \n\n- I used to have two really good videos where people walked step by step through purchasing reputation management services and observing them in action and their results.  Unfortunately they've been removed.  Unsurprising really.  \n\n &nbsp;\n\nIt should be noted that plants are usually more subtle.  But like every market, there is a range of prices with a range of skill.  A properly professional service would be using old long standing accounts they purchased/farmed with plenty of karma and consistent participation in the same subreddit.  And they know how to talk like normal people.  Basically the only reason these some plants are so obvious is because they are bad at their job.  But I'm betting they were cheaper than their competitors.  \n\nAs someone who used to work tech support and maintained very high metrics, I can tell you that the ability of someone to manipulate other people into buying into your BS or sell them something is very high.  Had I lacked a sense of ethics that job at, shall we say \"HostCrater\", I would have made me about twice as much as it did via commissions for sales.  But I wanted to help people, not be a selfish asshole selling worthless security services and unneeded upgrades and dedicated servers/design services.  The only reason my commitment to not being a dick didn't get me fired is because of my metrics and training of new employees.  Otherwise their attempts to fire me for lack of sales would have absolutely gone through.  \n\n &nbsp;\n\nThis should go without saying, but obviously there are some die hard fans or people that exist that actually believe  extremist/hyperbolic viewpoints, but there are also plants.  This is actually one of the reasons it's difficult to track down which are plants because some people really are shockingly out of touch or emotionally invested.  HOWEVER, the plants that are good at their job generally try to appear to be much more well reasoned so they are taken more seriously.  Being too extremist robs your of the credibility you need to push your narrative.  Though, as mentioned below, having a few throwaway extremist accounts can still be very useful to make your main accounts appear more reasonable.  \n\nThe idea of \"anyone who disagrees is a plant\" is simply a fallacious argument.  I made a generalization because, in general, people who disagree with you will ignore nuance and cherry pick out specific words to try and spin your argument.  This is actually one of the primary ways to muddy the waters so you can spin a conversation, you actively try to discredit the other side.  And when you are a plant paid to use multiple accounts you can play good cop/bad cop with the explicit targeted result of discrediting someone and then turning the message.  All by yourself.  It's not even hard.  You seem much more reasonable in comparison to your other extremist account.  Even if you view is still somewhat extreme still your \"bad cop\" account makes your \"good cop\" account seem more reasonable/moderate by comparison.  And \"bad cop\" accounts are easy, you don't have to make them reasonable or credible or have history.  You send them out there to make a certain viewpoint look bad or to make your viewpoint look better.", "created_utc": 1558072506.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1558072940.0, "id": "envaowv", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_bpklz0", "parent_id": "t1_enum1nm", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/bpklz0/robert_pattinson_to_play_the_batman_for_matt/envaowv/", "score": 32, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Ralathar44", "author_id": "edjnh", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Dude, I was literally thinking the same thing as you.

Then, of those, you had to get 30-50 if the right diameter/color/quality to make a simple necklace (Daisy from The Great Gatsby, she\u2019s wearing hundreds, *mansions* worth of pearls).\n\nHow is a pearl necklace constructed? Silk thread through a tiny hole drilled in each pearl with a gold/silver clasp (maybe some diamonds or other stones on the clasp but pennies compared to a single pearl). They break, it happens. Wear or damage, whatever. But those pearls cost more than the average america\u2019s salary EACH. Makers know this and knot the thread after each pearl (maybe every two in lower quality necklaces).\n\nThose pearls bouncing around just *scream* fake. Even if Martha was too socially conscious to have a *new* necklace, the Wayne vaults would have been bursting with old jewelry that could be refitted (and she\u2019s usually wearing high fashion/furs in those scenes anyways so I don\u2019t buy it).\n\n**tl;dr: It an overdone trope and worse, it assumes one of the wealthiest women in the city went out in costume jewelry**", "created_utc": 1558060324.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "enuoijb", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_bpklz0", "parent_id": "t1_enuhygf", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/bpklz0/robert_pattinson_to_play_the_batman_for_matt/enuoijb/", "score": 34, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Vysharra", "author_id": "bfx79", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Batman reboots lead to bat-parents reshoots.", "created_utc": 1558059100.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "enuli3p", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_bpklz0", "parent_id": "t1_enuhmk1", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/bpklz0/robert_pattinson_to_play_the_batman_for_matt/enuli3p/", "score": 605, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "alfredhelix", "author_id": "r9o9r", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Let\u2019s start from the beginning... one last time", "created_utc": 1558061024.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "enuq89c", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_bpklz0", "parent_id": "t1_enuhmk1", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/bpklz0/robert_pattinson_to_play_the_batman_for_matt/enuq89c/", "score": 11, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Squirrelly_Dan_dling", "author_id": "3eqxngj3", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "It's not even radioactive.
