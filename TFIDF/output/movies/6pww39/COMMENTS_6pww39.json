It\u2019s a moment that feels very reminiscent of The Shining: \u201cANGLE FROM BEHIND her as she steps out of the water, towards him.  The naked woman\u2019s back is full of sores and bleeding, her butt shredded and rotten.\u201d\n\n>Beverly gets dressed up for Stan\u2019s Bar Mitzvah; her father is turned on by her prettiness and attempts to rape her (again, most likely under the manipulative force of Pennywise).  After Stan\u2019s Bar Mitzvah, the town is consumed in a storm as the well-armed Losers Club ventures into the sewers. They\u2019re followed by the Bowers Gang who, led by Travis, plan on killing them all.\n\n>The Losers are thrust back into the sewers, which are being flooded by the relentless storm raging above. They fear drowning, but Beverly takes each one of her male companion\u2019s faces between her hands: \u201cOne by one the kids shoot out of a STORM PIPE into the PENOBSCOT RIVER, just like Georgie\u2019s paper boat. They pop up like tops, blinking owlishly against the daylight. The sky is blue.  The storm has passed.\u201d\n\nSo, yeah, Fukunaga had no intention of including that scene, if this is the real script. It really does just follow the machinations of the novel. I mean, King made it clear that Bev's dad was sexually abusing her. Fukunaga planned to translate that to film too, I guess. \n\nhttp://horrorfreaknews.com/read-cancelled-remake-script-starring-will-poulter-heres-might", "created_utc": 1501179012.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dkszg1j", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6pww39", "parent_id": "t1_dksyi8e", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6pww39/it_2017_official_trailer/dkszg1j/", "score": 27, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Top_Drawer", "author_id": "6yvly", "subreddit_name": "movies"}]
