I was 20. I remember seeing like one ad for it and was kind of moderately interested in it. Two weeks after it was released, I finally decided I\u2019d go watch it, but it was no longer playing in my local theater or any other in the area. I thought that was odd but chalked it up to being a bad film since it bombed so badly. Turns out, Warner\u2019s *crushed* this film and let it bomb *on purpose*. This was not an instant classic. It was deliberately buried and not promoted properly. It wouldn\u2019t be until several years later when people discovered it on home video that it would be properly recognized as a classic.\n\nOnly a year later did I watch it at home and realized what an amazing film it was.\n\nThere\u2019s a documentary called [The Giant\u2019s Dream](https://youtu.be/lWPcTgDwRLQ) that goes into detail about why the film bombed at the box office and how insanely unfair Warner\u2019s was to Brad Bird.

He's just a lonely kid who wants a friend to play with him. He never comes off as a miniature adult. He doesn't wisecrack or make pseudo-adult innuendos. He's just a kid.\n\nOne of the scene that best exemplifies this is when he has to find something to \\*do\\* with his 50ft metal friend. Does he go on a revenge spree through town with Giant beating up all his bullies? No. He gets in a junk car and has the Giant spin him around until he almost pukes. THAT is something a 10 year-old would do.\n\nI recently saw a Netflix movie about a girl who finds a robot and she goes on a vandalism spree with it and uses it to get revenge on her bullies. In one scene, she straight-up demands that the robot **murder** one of her bullies. It's just too intense and too violent. I didn't even finish the movie, because I really didn't like how they wrote the main character. Her motivations were mean-spirited and selfish and dangerous. If the robot had been a gun, she'd have been a school shooter.\n\nSo it's always interesting to compare Iron Giant to other similar movies. Brad Bird got it sooooo right and so many other movies get it soooo wrong.

I wrote an exhaustive 4-part essay on this exact subject.\n\nYou're absolutely right that Little Mermaid saved Disney and brought out that musical idea, but ya know where they got the ideas for that format?\n\nAn American Tale. \n\nIt.was.huge. When American Tale came out, it did a few things...but one of the things you can really thank it for giving us was the radio-friendly movie song. Somewhere Out There was...everywhere. And it propelled the movie into the stratosphere, it was a marketing avenue that had never even been considered, but once Bluth's company perfected it, it became a part of movie culture. \n\nThat's not to say Bluth was the first company to put a song from a movie out on the radio, but the difference here was that it was a song from an animated kid's movie, I imagine a lot of people just figured it couldn't be done. \n\nOnce they did it, though, Eisner took what he liked from the formula...polished it up and added some Disney \"magic\" to it, and churned out a decade of unbelievably successful films.\n\nAnd to be clear, I'm not saying it was *all* Bluth...not by a long shot. Disney made a lot of changes to their approach to animation, this formula was just one piece of the puzzle. An important one, sure, but not at all the most important.\n\nThe reason I don't think Eisner could have pulled it off without Bluth is because Eisner was initially a little skeptical that Disney Animation could be resurrected. You have to remember how ridiculously \"Reagan-y\" Eisner was as a CEO. He had an infamous memo wherein he talks about Disney's obligation as it pertains to making art...and his opinion was \"We have no obligation to make art, only to make money. But if we chase that dolla hard enough, we're bound to make something with cultural significance every once in a while, right?\"\n\nEisner famously put Disney's animation department on notice that they were one bad movie away from the unemployment line after sending them to work in a dingy warehouse, saying they had to earn their way back to Burbank. His contribution to the company can't be overstated...but if it weren't for Bluth showing him that animation *can* make money, I have a feeling he might not have taken the risks he did in that regard.", "created_utc": 1554388484.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "ek3qa75", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_b9b8i1", "parent_id": "t1_ek3pijv", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/b9b8i1/after_20_years_the_childlike_innocence_of_brad/ek3qa75/", "score": 6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "rugtoad", "author_id": "4ds5g", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "And her butler has some of the best entrances and exits too.
