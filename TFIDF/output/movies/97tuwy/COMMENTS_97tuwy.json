Plus, some people think she's type-casted herself (I'm not even going to argue if that's true or not) and sometimes you start to blend the actress with her characters, so if you really dislike what kind of characters she plays you might start to dislike her in general.", "created_utc": 1534449974.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e4b9e7d", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_97tuwy", "parent_id": "t1_e4b1qo1", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/97tuwy/scarlett_johansson_announced_as_worlds_highest/e4b9e7d/", "score": 59, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "rikkirikkiparmparm", "author_id": "xfuab", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "i don't hate her, but to be fair shes been involved in two pretty controversial castings recently, accusations of white washing ghost in a shell and the whole trans one.\n\nI don't think either warranted the outcry they got, but if you're looking for a reason some might hate her currently, factor in the irrational nature of people, look at what shes been involved in and expect people to hate.", "created_utc": 1534455665.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e4bfze0", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_97tuwy", "parent_id": "t1_e4b1qo1", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/97tuwy/scarlett_johansson_announced_as_worlds_highest/e4bfze0/", "score": 19, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Fanatical_Idiot", "author_id": "134zgik", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Nephew..", "created_utc": 1534464216.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e4boyeq", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_97tuwy", "parent_id": "t1_e4boqew", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/97tuwy/scarlett_johansson_announced_as_worlds_highest/e4boyeq/", "score": 239, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "xabrokensoulx", "author_id": "b2ste", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Thanks for signing up for Judge Judy Facts! \n\nYou will now receive fun daily facts about Judge Judy!\n\n/\u2572/\u256d( \u2022\u0300 \u15dc \u2022\u0301 )\u256e/\u2571\ufeff", "created_utc": 1534465232.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e4bpzdk", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_97tuwy", "parent_id": "t1_e4boqew", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/97tuwy/scarlett_johansson_announced_as_worlds_highest/e4bpzdk/", "score": 120, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "joninco", "author_id": "8e8y0", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Thanos", "created_utc": 1534469875.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e4bupqg", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_97tuwy", "parent_id": "t1_e4boqew", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/97tuwy/scarlett_johansson_announced_as_worlds_highest/e4bupqg/", "score": 8, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "sonicrespawn", "author_id": "nado5", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "(snaps fingers)", "created_utc": 1534467926.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e4bsqc7", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_97tuwy", "parent_id": "t1_e4boqew", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/97tuwy/scarlett_johansson_announced_as_worlds_highest/e4bsqc7/", "score": 6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "AbsoluteDarkness", "author_id": "gc7nn", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Word is bond", "created_utc": 1534465176.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e4bpxa3", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_97tuwy", "parent_id": "t1_e4bnpe1", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/97tuwy/scarlett_johansson_announced_as_worlds_highest/e4bpxa3/", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Topblokelikehodgey", "author_id": "ybxnf", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Something I've simultaneously never wanted to see and always wanted to see.
