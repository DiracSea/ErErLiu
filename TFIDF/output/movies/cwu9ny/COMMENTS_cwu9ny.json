They will get careers, start families, live and die maybe working in Hollywood their whole lives, and yet they'll never get to do a damn thing with their favorite character, a cornerstone of their culture - unless they were at the right company at the right time.\n\nI really don't get why I'm supposed to care so much that someone who grew up a fan of Spider-Man can't profit off of the character when they become an adult.

People can obviously draw the character or write fan fiction for fun, dress up as him and go to conferences, etc. So this isn't about not being able to \"do a damn thing\", it's a question of whether or not someone should be able to profit off of stories and characters they didn't create.\n\nAlso:\n\n> The films they put out can be absolutely awful, and it doesn't matter.

A Spider-Man movie is competing with whatever other blockbusters are out and its performance is measured against other similar movies as well. \n\nFinally:\n\n> Imagine a world where studios actually had to compete with each other. Where they'd have to work hard and compete to give us the best Spider-Man movies they could. \n\nI don't accept this argument without proof. I think studios would have less interest in dedicating the amount of resources they do to IP they don't fully own and that we'd be likely to see a ton of shitty content. I think while there are bad superhero movies, studios don't go in intending to make schlock and profit off of the brand alone. That they want to promote the brand they own and make it as valuable as possible.

From day one Marvel Inc. owned Spider-Man. There are creator owned comic properties/heroes (Todd McFarlane owns Spawn, I assume Robert Kirkman owns the Walking Dead and Mark Miller owns all of his books-turned-movie-pitches). But when Spider-Man was created they knew from day one it did not belong to them, they were writing these stories for a company and that if they left, Marvel would own the rights and still keep publishing (which they have for 50+ years), and to just try to say \u201cfuck that\u201d to all these stories and history is ridiculous. \n\nThe reason why Spider-Man is who he is because for 50+ years, Marvel has been cultivating the character and growing him in the books, and then when the time came branched out. The creators may be gone now but many others are still around, and often still contributing. The second artist to take the reins and help grow Spider-Man John Romita, who created MJ, Gwen, the Osborn\u2019s, the Kingpin, the Rhino, and his son John Romita Jr. (who drew the first Mr. Negative story which was a big part of the PS4 game) are still around to see the characters they created for Marvel being brought to other screens. Roy Thomas the first person who took over writing and then editing Spider-Man over from Stan Lee, and created Morbius (who has a movie in development) plus co-created Wolverine is still alive. \n\nMy point is that Spider-Man wasn\u2019t drawn up 50+ years ago by two guys who are long gone, it was created for a company, and when those people left that company back in the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s they chose and found people to replace them.

The most important are trademarks, copyright, and patents, although there are others like trade dress as well.\n\nTrademarks are things like words or images that represent a certain brand. Think \"Microsoft\" or \"Nike\". You are not allowed to start a software company called Microsoft, or make shoes with the Nike swoosh because those things are trademarked. Trademarks last pretty much as long as the company that owns them keeps them protected. The purpose of trademarks is to make sure that companies and people can't mislead you by making knock-off versions of the same product and use the same brand. If you buy a Coca-Cola, you know it's \"real\" Coke, and not someone just pretending (assuming you live in a country where bootlegging is kept in check).\n\nCopyrights are the protection on creative works. When you draw a picture or write a story, you automatically own the copyright on that work. That means I can't take your picture or story and sell it, or even simply redistribute it without your permission. When a company uses its employees to create a work, then the company owns the copyright. These are limited-time, but the time has been extended in the United States to be rather long.\n\nOlder works like Hamlet or Pride and Prejudice are old enough that their copyrights have expired and so you are free to make as many copies of those works as you want as they have entered the \"public domain\". You can even sell them if you would like to. If a work still has a copyright, then you have to get a license from the copyright holder in order to make copies of the work. Anything from the early 20th century on is still under copyright in the United States due to the lengthy copyright period.\n\nThe purpose of copyrights is to encourage creative work by creating artificial scarcity. If you write a story, shoot a film, or develop a video game, you know that for the duration of your lifetime you can sell that work without worrying about people simply duplicating it for free. For example, the novel \"A Game of Thrones\" was published in 1991. If copyright only lasted 14 years, HBO could have made the show without paying George R. R. Martin anything.\n\nI am not a lawyer and so I may have misrepresented some things, but I believe what I have written to be generally true. Also, if I may offer a bit of editorialization, I think it's perfectly reasonable for copyrights to be long, though they may have gotten too long at this point. If I write a novel or create a film, why shouldn't I be able to make money on it for my lifetime? If a company invests literally millions or even billions of dollars in a franchise, why shouldn't they be able to reap the rewards of that franchise for a long time? I suspect that those who argue for little or no copyright simply never produce anything worth protecting and want to just get everything for free, without realizing that we would have far less entertainment if those protections didn't exist.", "created_utc": 1567056361.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "eyfwbjf", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_cwu9ny", "parent_id": "t1_eyftedc", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/cwu9ny/everyone_choosing_sides_in_the_disneysony_debate/eyfwbjf/", "score": 54, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "dominusludi", "author_id": "at0pt", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "A trademark can be held indefinitely, and as long as it exists you can't generate new works based on the old works that may have entered the public domain.\n\nIf there's a trademark, then it's off limits.

Each character slides into public domain as that window expires, so while Spider-Man and Aunt May may fall into public domain one year, newer characters like Judas Traveller or Ezekiel won't for a long time. \n\nSherlock Holmes is an excellent comparison. Same for Dracula.  Both have had high-profile adaptations from many companies, but both were also fought over in the early days of cinema. Nosferatu, one of the most famous films of the Silent Film era, was a thinly veiled adaptation of Dracula, so changed so as to avoid copyright lawsuits. \n\nWhat's funny about the comment you are replying to is that a company could, today, with Spidey still under copyright, make a superhero named Arachno with a green and purple suit who shoots webs out of his hands and crawls on walls, and they'd be protected as long as it's not similar enough to Spider-Man that it could cause confusion. \n\nSo, BEFORE spider-man enters public domain, you can do that, but after he does, you can do whatever you want. \n\n\nA caveat: In addition to logos and such, you can't copy the likeness of a public domain character from a copywrited work. It's why when higher-profile Frankenstein films have been made by anyone other than Universal, they're monsters have not looked like Boris Karloff. The monster is public domain, but the unique look that Karloff had with Jack Pierce's make-up, that's trademarked. Some toe the line, but most still take enough liberty to just barely avoid Universal's formerly infamous copyright hammer.", "created_utc": 1567078607.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1567078865.0, "id": "eygy0gd", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_cwu9ny", "parent_id": "t1_eyg0dff", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/cwu9ny/everyone_choosing_sides_in_the_disneysony_debate/eygy0gd/", "score": 90, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "NazzerDawk", "author_id": "63iec", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Exactly.

Under the strictest definition of the law, fan fiction is illegal since only the copyright owner can create derivative works.   Note that this is regardless of whether you monetize the work or not.  Monetization is mainly relevant in determining whether monetary damages are awarded.  However, any copyright owner can certainly demand to have the fan fiction removed at the very least.  And some authors actively do, to the point that fanfiction sites tend to reject any material derived from their works.  Anne Rice is probably the most famous example of this.\n\nIf you're a fanfiction writer being sued, you would have to defend yourself by claiming fair use, which is not automatically awarded and is judged on a case by case basis.  Works of parody or criticism, and those created for educational purposes, are in general considered fair use by statute and case law, and thus have an easier time clearing the requirements.  Fanfiction, however, hasn't been determined legally as fulfilling these requirements so you would have to argue why your derivative work should also qualify under fair use.\n\nThe reason why fanfiction isn't legally pursued much is in general because there is no point.

Let's say that a smaller property is entering public domain tomorrow. The property is Sailor Moon.  Day one, 3 companies announce they are making movies on Sailor Moon.  The one fans will see first, will be the one that releases first. The first release will have been made cheeper and quicker to beat the others.  This leads to poorer quality.  It ruins any goodwill the other movies have.  By the time the third one comes out, not only does it get the smallest Box Office, but it cost the most to produce. Never mind that there may have been a TV show or book series to come out even sooner.\n\nTo avoid the bigger losses next time, the third place studio will go cheeper and quicker on the next property.  I see a cycle where cream doesn't rise to the crop, but a constant chase towards the bottom.
