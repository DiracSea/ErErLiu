[{"body": "Disney has become very focused on sticking close to formulas, especially where animation is concerned, and I'm not surprised in the least that they lost the Oscar. Incredibles 2 was fun, Wreck It Ralph 2 was fun, but Spiderverse was _different_. Despite being good stories, I2 and WIR2 were by and large more of the same, visually. Almost to the point where the innovations are not noticeable anymore. I'm of the mind that we've neared the plateau of Pixar style. \n\nSpiderverse was an honest-hearted attempt at a new style, something we haven't seen in a while. It contained honest artistry, passion, vigor. The story and characters were great, but the main draw for me was the pure inspiration in the visuals. That's what the animation Oscar should be for. Not just good stories, but attempts to push the medium forward in terms of artistry. It had elements of all eras of animation all working in tandem to make something so fantastically _other_.

Fun casting, fun characters, nothing stand-out on that front, but the art that went in to bringing it all to life was loads of fun.\n\nAdding to that, the people they employed and the processes they used in coming up with the sets, costumes, art design, etc etc, was all just really top notch. It made the overall design of Black Panther feel authentic, whereas it totally could have gone the route of feeling fake as fuck if they didn't do it right. I think it paid good homeage to African art and culture (something that is, in the west, very fresh indeed, given our long and shitty history on that front).\n\nPlot wise, though? Totally generic, for sure, but still a lot of fun.\n\n\nRagnarok was a nice strong departure from the overall formula and tempo of the MCU.

Trying to fit in, trying to use his head to accomplish things and failing at each over and over. Being mocked and belittled by everyone around you, including your father, because you are weaker or don't want to do the macho stuff. \n\nThen the story progresses naturally. Problems are solved, and created, because of the characters logical actions according to the characteristics we've already seen instead of funny coincidences. \n\nAnd lastly Hiccup doesn't get off scot-free at the end. He loses something and I think that's really important to show. Life isn't all butterflies and roses after you solve a problem and sometimes you lose something important that you can never get back. I always hate on those other shows when the sacrifice a character makes becomes undone as if being willing to make the sacrifice is all that's required. \n\nThen all this gets turned on it's head in the second one when Hiccup has to learn that sometimes his way doesn't work. It's another media trope that has long needed to get turned on it's head. Sometimes you have to fight for what you want because not everyone is willing to talk.

There\u2019s a branch of artistic/technical people for basically every category. Those in the Actor and casting director branches vote on the acting awards. Writing branch voters vote for original and adapted screenplay. Animation and short film get separated into their own branches, don\u2019t know why they\u2019re together, and they vote for their respective categories. And so on for the others.\n\nBest Foreign Language Film can have its own specialized branch made up of members from the producing and directing branches that have artistic achievement in making foreign language films. \n\nEveryone votes for Best Picture. Or if that\u2019s not much of a change, only producers vote for Best Picture.\n\nExcept the only sticking point I can think of would be the Public Relations branch and I think there\u2019s a group of like \u201cgeneral achievement\u201d voters.
