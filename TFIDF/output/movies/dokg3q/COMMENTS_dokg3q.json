Mostly everyone in Westeros is reacting to the red wedding, while Daenerys is doing her white savior thing and liberates a bunch of yunkai slaves. the episode ends with her crowd surfing over a bunch of brown people calling her \"mhysa\", or \"mother.\"\n\nnow, being the very mildly astute person I am, when I saw this title, I thought, \"lady stoneheart\" and promptly pooed myself a little bit in anticipation. It was the perfect set-up. right after the daenerys scene, they'd cut to this decrepit, dark, falmer-ass cave and do one of the coolest scenes in the entire fucking series. A Frey gets dragged into some mysterious, cult enclave, shitting his pants, and then there's just this *mass* of bile and hatred... staring right at him. \n\n> >!Her cloak and collar hid the gash his brother's blade had made, but her face was even worse than he remembered.

Beneath her ravaged scalp, her face was shredded skin and black blood where she had raked herself with her nails. But her eyes were the most terrible thing. Her eyes saw him, and they hated.!<\n\nGod, such a brilliant set-up. Such great juxtaposition with Daenerys' naive optimism. D&D, you sons of bitches, you've done it again. Think about how people would react! \"oh she is READY to fucking MURDER\" -- people would stew in that thought for MONTHS while waiting for season 4.\n\nBut it... didn't happen. Lady Stoneheart never showed up. D&D whiffed on one of the greatest moments and progression in the entire series. They really ended a season on *Dany crowdsurfing.*\n\nThat episode aired in June 2013. A few months before, in March, The Walking Dead coincidentally also had its 3rd season finale. It's the one where Andrea dies. If you don't remember it, it's because it was a really pathetic death. She's tied to a chair and fails to muster the foot dexterity of a potato necessary to escape. If you *do* remember it, it's probably because you read the comics, where Andrea was the absolute baddest bitch within a thousand mile radius and survived throughout the arc, and were infuriated by how the showrunners treated her character. \n\nPretty much until the very moment I realized she was a goner, I had high hopes that the show was gonna turn things around and progress her into the badass she's supposed to be. Why wouldn't they? Andrea is fucking awesome. Why would they waste such a great opportunity? \n\nWell, they did waste it.

This wasn't an accident where someone had a strong vision but missed the mark.
