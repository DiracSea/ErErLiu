Portman deserves praise for being honest and open about her own personal experiences as a child actor, though \"we shouldn't sexualize children\" is sort of an obvious sentiment and no one who is doing it is actually working under the delusion that it's acceptable behavior.  It's more that they just think they can get away with it.  I also agree with the posts bringing up Portman's enormous hypocrisy in complaining about the sexualization of children, while having actively and openly supported an admitted child rapist; as well as those criticizing her hyperbolic use of the word \"terrorism\".\n\nBut since this is a subreddit for movies, I actually thought this was an interesting part of the article that no one is talking about:\n\n>Portman said she adjusted her behavior, rejected roles with kissing scenes and emphasized her \"bookish and serious\" side. She built a reputation as a \"prudish, conservative, nerdy, serious\" young woman in order to feel her body was safe and her voice heard.\n\nA lot of discussion has been had about why Portman's career never really took off like it should have.  Audiences loved The Professional and were amazed at how good she was both in the film and the press tour surrounding it, but this brought the expectation that she would gravitate towards similarly controversial and challenging roles in the future.  Instead most of the projects she picked as a teen and a young adult were pure schlock, and the speculation has always ranged from her agent simply being terrible to the Star Wars prequels having completely tarnished her image as a competent actor.  But this article paints a different picture and seems to suggest she eschewed challenging, meaty roles in favor of prioritizing projects that made her feel \"comfortable\" and apparently emphasized her \"bookish\" side.  It makes you wonder what her career would have been like if sexual harassment hadn't influenced her decisions.

We've all seen posts about how people need to be better at critical thinking and fact checking for themselves, but not as many faulting the sharer of information.   Also how do you hold those accountable that share bad information, especially when you have people that will still read and believe information from that source regardless of their credibility?  \n\nA lot of this comes down to personal accountability, taking pride in your trustworthiness and other virtues.   I believe I heard this on NPR (i could be mixing it up though), but it was something to the tune of virtues are no longer valued in society as they once were.  \n\nIt's definetly an interesting topic to explore and there are no easy answers.   \n", "created_utc": 1516505077.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dszv42f", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7rtu27", "parent_id": "t1_dsztvpl", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7rtu27/natalie_portman_at_13_experienced_sexual_terrorism/dszv42f/", "score": 36, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "JBits001", "author_id": "zoxtk", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "If we didn\u2019t click it, nobody would write it.
