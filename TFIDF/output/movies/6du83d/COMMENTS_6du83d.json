Hollywood sword fighting is descended from Olympic fencing, which as was mentioned is more focused on parries. Hollywood sword fighting takes it to the next level for tension and drama, so we can have cool, long scenes like this with near misses and swashbuckling. Errol Flynn's Robin Hood or Zorro also showcase that style. This fight is excellent because it is beautifully choreographed, the banter is witty, and there is still tension and uncertainty as to who will  win.\n\nAdditionally, this scene is great because all their banter about the various swordmasters and techniques is accurate. They're referring to real, historical people and moves, which gives it an extra sparkle if you look up the names afterwards.\n\nHistorical sword fighting didn't use Hollywood-style parrying because it damaged the sword and made you expend too much energy stopping the sword dead. Instead it focused on dodging, redirecting, or binding your opponent's blade so you can control it while simultaneously attacking. Essentially, parrying was just another tool in the box, not the entire show. Also, most sword fights are composed of seizing up your opponent, changing guards, and about three seconds of very confusing fighting where it's rarely clear who struck who first to spectators. Not very entertaining for the general public.
