It's less noticeable than the rather interesting fake instruments in the original *Lion King* score (all of them are relatively alright, but the sax and the flutes both just take me out of it), but it does mean they could have a full score throughout for a fraction of the cost of hiring an orchestra, and with far fewer mistakes - a friend of a friend played tuba in the original Star Wars and there is a part in the main theme where he misses a note.

That is in stark contrast to a (pseudo)one-shot scene in the middle of the film where there's no music, very little dialog, and all you hear is the sounds of a frantic fight that has all combatants visually exhausted to the point of barely being able to stand. It's a fantastic scene that's punctuated by the lack of music. Had the film had other silent moments like that, that one scene wouldn't have been as powerful. \n\nThe same can be said about Last Jedi.

All you hear is the echo of the ship reaching warp and you see the beautiful view of an entire fleet being decimated to complete silence. \n\nI also disagree about overscoring happening in general.
