As you can see 1st avatar made $2.788 billion dollars.\u00a0\n\nJames cameron is making avatar 2-5 back to back to back, so that they can release them one year after the other without 2+ year breaks like star war episodes 7-9 and other franchises.\u00a0\n\nIf each sequel makes even half as much as the 1st it could come close to passing star wars in 2nd.  However to catch and surpass marvel they'd have to make with 3bill each sequel, which I dont see happening, but hell the 1st one cme close so why not.\n\nSo think about it, right now these are the current numbers for highest grossing franchises. Sure some of these non-disney franchises will make more movies and money, but by the time all avatar sequels have been released as well as whatever MCU and starwars movie come out between now and then.

That distress call is from a ship that is inhabited by eggs which hatch the xenomorph, a dangerous alien. It's super-smart, quick, strong, and has acid for blood. The xenomorph gets on the mining ship. Ripley, one of the cargo crew, fights the alien along with the crew and manages to kill it, but only after setting the self-destruct on the mining ship and getting into an escape pod. Ripley records a quick message, turns on the distress beacon, and freezes herself in cryo-sleep in the escape pod heading toward home.\n\n**Aliens (Alien 2)**:\nRipley's escape pod is discovered, but she finds that the colony she hoped would hear her pod's distress call missed it, so she kept going and it took 57 years for her to pass another colony deep on the outer reaches, and so her daughter had aged and just recently died just before she was woken up. The mining company is threatening to charge her with  the destruction of the mining ship since they think it could have been avoided, since they have no idea how dangerous the alien was.\n\nThe mining company has created a colony on LV-426 and want Ripley to go check it out because she has experience with the alien and the colony has stopped responding to contact. She goes to the colony, where it is discovered that someone found the original ship that had crashed and the colony then purposely infected multiple people with the alien eggs to study them... the alien was too dangerous and broke out and basically killed everyone except a little girl named Newt, who Ripley takes to because she had just lost her own daughter.\n\nThe place is overrun with xenomorphs and there's a queen in the colony putting out more eggs, but Newt falls down a hatch and Ripley goes into the heart of the colony to find her, eventually facing the alien queen. Almost all of the marines that the company sent with her originally have died, so she faces it alone, gets out, and kills the queen after it attaches to her shuttle on the way out. Ripley freezes herself again, along with a cyborg, one of the marines that nearly died, and Newt.\n\n**Alien 3**:\n\nThe ship they all freeze themselves on crashes because apparently one or more eggs survived from the queen... the marine dies (he actually dies in one of the books in between these movies but that's not important) and Newt ~~is burned to death~~ **dies** in the ensuing chaos. The cyborg dies as well, but his circuits are still around... not important. Ripley survives the crash, landing on a prison colony full of men. It's very religious, but again... not important to this comment.\n\nThe mining company tracks Ripley down because she might have the queen's DNA since she was impregnated when her ship went down. Realizing that the company just wants to experiment on her to control the alien, and that the alien is too powerful and they'll probably just end up releasing it on Earth, she jumps into the foundry's melted metal, killing herself.\n\n**Alien Resurrection (Alien 4)**:\n\nRipley wakes up, alive. Apparently, after hundreds of years, a military industrial organization has managed to take what little was left of Ripley and get the mixture of the queen's DNA and hers and bring them both back, mixed together. Ripley quickly realizes she is part xenomorph... and that the military group is buying humans en-masse to experiment on to try to create a new queen. They have a few xenomorphs in containment already, and are experimenting on them. Ripley tries to tell them that the xenomorphs are smart and will escape, but they don't listen.\n\nThe xenomorphs are smart, and they escape. The military ship is very quickly filled with corpses. Ripley feels slightly detached from humans since she is part xenomorph and also because she realizes every problem so far has been created because of human greed and lust for power. She tracks down the primary experiment, a queen that was born of her DNA. The xenomorph queen dedicated her own life to creating a child through birthing instead of an egg, because it had partial human DNA and wanted to create the ultimate form between her and Ripley as a gift of sorts. The child of that amalgamation is slightly different in terms of it's biology, and it kills the xenomorph queen, instead recognizing Ripley as it's mother. Ripley tries to escape the thing, but it gets onto her escape pod after the military ship is self-destructed so that it doesn't reach Earth.\n\nRipley uses her own acidic blood (since she was remade with partial xenomorph queen DNA) to create a hole in the window of the escape pod, and tricks the baby xenomorph into getting sucked out of a very small hole. It is screaming for Ripley, it's mother, to have mercy on it or to love it or something... hard to say... but it's fucked.\n\n-----\n\nRipley goes from a cargo hauler hoping to get home to her daughter... to a woman who loses her daughter and saves a little girl, facing off against an alien mother with each trying to protect \"their young\"... to someone afraid she's about to be the mother of an alien.... to the mother of an alien that she must destroy even though she feels a biological love for it...\n\nIt's ultimately a tale about motherhood on top of being an amazing series that spans multiple genres.\n\n-----\n\nThe point above though, is the question of how the xenomorph-infected ship got on LV-426. In the new prequel series, there are a race of \"Engineers\" that created a precursor to the xenomorph as a weapon of sorts, and lost control of it, but it's never explained how the Engineer ship arrived on LV-426. There's an android named David that seems to be the one that takes the original xenomorph creature and morphs it into the alien we see in the original movies through genetic engineering.

The alien is present but not the real threat. The prisoners have a problem with Ripley because she represents sin and temptation in what is essentially a convent filled with celibate religious followers. She is at risk not only from people blaming her for their impure thoughts and actions, but also because of the company wanting to control her body. I would never say that its a feminist movie or that Ripley is a feminist character, but the film is largely based around female struggles at its core, even past the point of the pregnancy story line. In the end, it makes a statement about death... acceptance of it and what it can accomplish. \n\n\n\nThe fourth and final film inverts that serious tone entirely with a Joss-Whedon-space-smuggler group teaming up with Ripley to fight the uncontrolled greed and disregard for human life. We meet characters that have done terrible deeds, deciding to stand up for what is right even though it's a suicide mission, and redeem themselves. We also see how powerful Ripley becomes by accepting the terrible things that have happened to her instead of running from them or denying them.

So you get a movie where the characters don't want to be put to sleep artificially (yeah the effort must be too great), then when they arrive in an entire planet with similar flora to Earth, they all take off their masks... bacteria anyone ? Anyone ? Bueller ?\n\nNevermind, at this point the movie wouldn't happen but scenario. So they get infected, some die, and they follow an android from Prometheus. Who killed in a cutscene the people living here. And he makes alien eggs. Real aliens. And he convinces the atheist, looking-for-proof-before-anything guy *to look inside* an egg.
