The animated film had no announced time period and has elements from all over the place. \n\n- The Tang Dynasty is one of ancient China\u2019s most liberal times (it had China\u2019s only women emperor regent although she technically made up her own dynasty,  crossdressing was trendy for women of the time) with a lot of foreigners in the capital (modern day Xi\u2019an). \n\n- As such, two Indian traders replace mushu as the main comic relief\n\n- The love interest is now a fellow soldier who is very competitive with Mulan in being the best soldier.\n\n- The film won\u2019t be a full out musical but they will have music play a key role in it\nhttps://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/disneys-live-action-mulan-lands-gong-li-jet-li-1101994\n\n- Fa and Hua are different ways to say the same character, one Cantonese, one mandarin. \n\n\n- There\u2019s little evidence that Mulan is a historical figure. She first appears in a ballad poem from the 6th century and not much is said except she joined the army to fight to replace her father and then returned home with honors.

I don't think a direct translation to live-action would fare that well because there are so many moving parts that just seem to work better in animation (tiny talking sidekick, Huns 'popping out of the snow like daisies', making an improvised zipline from a lantern, etc). Maybe I'm burned after how much I hated the new Beauty and the Beast.\n\nIf I want to see the version of *Beauty and the Beast* I love, I'll just watch the 1991 version. I don't need to watch a shittier version of it with horrible wooden acting and directorial choices that make no sense. That's what I'm afraid will happen again if the movie producers think they actually should try to satisfy the fans who want live action films to be the exact same as the animated original beat-by-beat.\n\nIn the same sense, if I want to nostalgia-trip about Mulan, I can just cue up the animated version. I already know that's going to be the best version of that particular iteration.\n\nIn the end, the 1998 version isn't the provenance of Mulan. It's a Chinese folktale. I don't see a problem with returning to the source material and making a different interpretation, one that is mainly for the audience that knows the original folktale.\n\nYeah, being cynical, this is probably just a cash grab for the Chinese market.
