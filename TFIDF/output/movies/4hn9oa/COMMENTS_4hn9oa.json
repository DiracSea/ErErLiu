Then you have to mock it up, test it, work out blocking and camera positioning to obscure the mechanisms that make the effect happen and then hope it goes well when the camera is rolling otherwise it could take a few hours to set it all up again.

This is from some behind the scenes stuff that aired on tv, probably around 1997 before the Lost World was released.  It was a fascinating story because they knew what they wanted (ripples to start in the middle and move radially and symmetrically to the edge of the cup), but they had no idea how to make it happen.  I forget who figured it out and how, but when they filmed, there was a guy hidden in the hood of the jeep, plucking a guitar string from under the dashboard of the jeep, to get the water to vibrate with each \"step\" of the T-Rex.\n\nGoogle \"[Jurassic Park Guitar Water](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=jurassic%20park%20guitar%20water)\" and you'll find something on the topic, though probably not the full clip from back in the day.\n\nEdit: might have [found it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9bKxRQfvs8&feature=youtu.be&t=26m16s)", "created_utc": 1462292037.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1462292316.0, "id": "d2r5pz2", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_4hn9oa", "parent_id": "t1_d2r4ick", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/4hn9oa/thought_rmovies_might_appreciate_this_was/d2r5pz2/", "score": 42, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "mealsharedotorg", "author_id": "4dyr8", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Yea, from Sioux City.
