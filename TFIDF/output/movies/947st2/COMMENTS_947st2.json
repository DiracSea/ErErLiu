While the band was still together they went almost a decade  without personally talking to each other  because Johnny \"stole\" Joey's girlfriend. Johnny was also very conservative and used to make Nazi/anti-semetic  jokes because Joey was Jewish. They would show up to practice and their concerts, say a few words about what the set list and show would be like and then that's it. The other band members had to negotiate between them. At the end of their careers, they pretty much dug themselves into a hole where they had to keep the band going in order to just make a living and get paid. \n\nThis happens with a lot of bands though. John Lennon and Paul McCartney were on a barely speaking basis towards the end of the Beatles. Kurt Cobain was considering firing Dave Grohl before he committed suicide (actually most people don't know that for the most part Nirvana broke up/went on hiatus right before Kurt died). The dudes in Metallica treated Jason Newstead like shit before he left the band because they still couldn't get over Cliff Burton dying. The brothers in Oasis still are feuding with each other and never seemed to like one another (there is that infamous Unplugged performance where the douche bag brother called it off because he was sick, leading to the other having to handle all the vocals during the show, then the douche bag brother showed up to the concert drunk and mocked him from the balcony). Ever since the Old Dirty Bastardized died, most of the dudes in the Wu Tang Clan don't seem to like or be around each other (with such a big group they have a lot of members who fall into there own cliques and power struggles). Most of the dudes in Slipknot don't seem like they care for each other (especially after Paul Grey died) and most the band's classic lineup is gone. Joe Strummed fired his former best friend Mick Jones from the Clash at the end of the band's career (naming there last album Cut the Crap after he left, Should I Stay or Should I Go? is actually about this). \n\nJust a ton of shit like this. I don't think most people realize that once a band or entertainment act breaks through to the mainstream/has moderate success, the thrill and specialness of it all just vanishes because now they are basically just running a type of business.
