I remember in 5th grade we would go to the library every Friday.  The library teacher would give a short talk about something, and then we were able to walk around and look at the books, and check them out.  \n\nOne Friday I get to the library, sit down with the class, look over, and I see this Captain Underpants book on display. I was SO drawn to the cover of the book.  I couldn't hear a word the teacher was saying, I was just ready for the talk to be over so I could rush over to the book and rent it out.  It was something about the colors, the title, and the illustration...I just had this deep connection to the book as soon as I saw it.  As if it was made just for me. \n\nWhen the talk was over, I get up to get the book, and six other kids ran over to the book before I could stand up. It crushed me.\n\nI thought I was having a unique connection with an object that I found. My taste, my personality, drew me to THIS book.  And then all of a sudden, I realized I wasn't the only one who wanted that book.  It was just a strange feeling.  Thinking this book was made special just for me.  But then seeing that it wasn't. \n\nIt's almost like reading a reddit thread title, judging it in your head, and seeing your judgement as the top comment posted by someone else.

Obviously the teachers don't like them, but one day they find an advertisement for a hypnosis ring in the back of a magazine. They order one and use it on their principal, Mr. Krupp. Turns out the ring actually works. The two order their principal to become the star of the comic they wrote; Captain Underpants (he fights for \"truth, justice, and all that is pre-shrunk and cottony\"). Unfortunately, he takes it too seriously, and winds up going out to fight crime and, miraculously, succeeding every time. Whenever water is splashed on Krupp's head, he turns back to normal, and whenever he hears someone snap their fingers, Krupp turns into Captain Underpants.\n\nThere are [12 Captain Underpants books](http://www.scholastic.com/captainunderpants/books/index.htm), along with a few spin-offs like Super Diaper Baby.\n\nThe books are filled with self-references, meta-humor, running gags, and fourth-wall breaks.
