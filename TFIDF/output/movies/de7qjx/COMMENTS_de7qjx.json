Do not go off script from the original film, watch the film follow the scenes 1:1 there is no reason to alter a classic just because the director thinks they can do better, they can't.\n3. Use CGI only on the gods, demons, and animals with real animatronics where possible... DO NOT JUST RELY ON CGI especially for close up shots.\n4. Do not explain more than necessary, if your audience is too stupid to get the simple hero's journey they are too stupid for the film and are thus not your target audience.\n5. Hire actors that can actually act, if the most emotion they can muster is a constipated expression with there mouth slightly a gape they are NOT to be in the film as the main characters.\n6. Take your time with this film. (if done with all of the above in mind it will not flop, and will remain a classic in the following decades).", "created_utc": 1570397161.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "f2tlz03", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_de7qjx", "parent_id": "t3_de7qjx", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/de7qjx/hayao_miyazaki_has_turned_down_multiple_offers/f2tlz03/", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "RyokoKnight", "author_id": "l9xu8a", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "They said to create buzz for a live action film.
