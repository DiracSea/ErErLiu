I was a waiter at a restaurant in NYC and his godson was having a private birthday party in the back room of our restaurant. I had been advised that he was an amateur sommelier and was bringing the wine for dinner. When Mr. Wilder arrived, he couldn't have been kinder. He asked my recommendation for a white wine before dinner and then for an entree suggestion based on the red wine he'd brought for the party. He made it a point to sincerely let me know he enjoyed both of my recommendations after they had arrived. \n\nHe was accompanied by his wife, Karen Boyer, with whom he was affectionate and attentive. He made time to speak with all the guests at dinner with the most gentle and considerate demeanor. \n\nAt the end of dinner, the guests took turns making toasts. When it was Mr. Wilder's turn, he simply stood up and opened his mouth to sing a few bars of a made up song. The only words were, \"I love you, love you, love you, yes I love you, love you, love you.\" I got big tears in my eyes. He was humble, kind, so full of love for his family and friends. I had the opportunity to peer into the life of one of my favorite comedians, and he was every bit as grand as I had imagined. Rest in Peace, Mr. Wilder. Thank you for all the laughs.

And I think, for a character in general, they\u2019re lovely sketches.\n\n>I love the main thing \u2014 the velvet jacket \u2014 and I mean to show by my sketch the exact same color. But I\u2019ve added two large pockets to take away from the svelt, feminine line. (Also in case of a few props.)\n\n>I also think the vest is both appropriate and lovely.\n\n>And I love the same white, flowing shirt and the white gloves. Also the lighter colored inner silk lining of the jacket.\n\n>What I don\u2019t like is the precise pin pointing in place and time as this costume does.\n\n>I don\u2019t think of Willy as an eccentric who holds on to his 1912 Dandy\u2019s Sunday suit and wears it in 1970, but rather as just an eccentric \u2014 where there\u2019s no telling what he\u2019ll do or where he ever found his get-up \u2014 except that it strangely fits him: Part of this world, part of another. A vain man who knows colors that suit him, yet, with all the oddity, has strangely good taste. Something mysterious, yet undefined.\n\n>I\u2019m not a ballet master who skips along with little mincy steps. So, as you see, I\u2019ve suggested ditching the Robert Helpmann trousers. Jodhpurs to me belong more to the dancing master. But once elegant now almost baggy trousers \u2014 baggy through preoccupation with more important things \u2014 is character.\n\n>Slime green trousers are icky. But sand colored trousers are just as unobtrusive for your camera, but tasteful.\n\n>The hat is terrific, but making it 2 inches shorter would make it more special.\n\n>Also a light blue felt hat-band to match with the same light blue fluffy bow tie shows a man who knows how to compliment his blue eyes.\n\n>To match the shoes with the jacket is fey. To match the shoes with the hat is taste.\n\n>Hope all is well. Talk to you soon.\n\n>All my best,\n\n>Gene\n\n[SOURCE](http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/06/part-of-this-world-part-of-another.html)", "created_utc": 1472500811.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d71n579", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_506s48", "parent_id": "t1_d71liy5", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/506s48/gene_wilder_dead_at_83/d71n579/", "score": 657, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "desantoos", "author_id": "7dphi", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "What a beautiful scene and a beautiful soul.\n\nEdit: \"If you want to view paradise, simply look around a view it.\"\n\nNever take life for granted people.", "created_utc": 1472499279.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1472500332.0, "id": "d71lw9k", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_506s48", "parent_id": "t1_d71liy5", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/506s48/gene_wilder_dead_at_83/d71lw9k/", "score": 748, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "MaxwellFish", "author_id": "g1wy9", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "[Better quality](https://youtu.be/r2pt2-F2j2g)", "created_utc": 1472499997.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d71mh9d", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_506s48", "parent_id": "t1_d71liy5", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/506s48/gene_wilder_dead_at_83/d71mh9d/", "score": 176, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Ericisweird", "author_id": "4p6vu", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "At first thought I want to be sad...but the more I watch it, the more I smile.
