It isn\u2019t about racism just being bad.

It's not just getting made to tell a story like a documentary and rack up awards. It\u2019s rare for a movie to humanize someone iconic to that degree. Everyone knows this guys name and what he did, but very few people know or even cared to learn anything about *him*. People wanted a space movie and they got a fairly depressing character study. And that\u2019s better. \n\nNeil isn\u2019t going to the moon for America or for the world, or for the glory of science, or any of the teary-eyed reasons people give. He doesn't even care when they give him the news of his mission. He doesn't get any enjoyment out of the process. He just does it. There are scenes in Apollo 13 when Tom Hanks is looking at the moon with amazement and wonder. Ryan Gosling looks at the moon in this movie with anger and determination.When he feels like his life is spiraling out of control, he looks at the moon in frustration.\n\nIt's treating the moon like a problem to be solved, not a mystical incredible voyage like every other space movie. There is no magic of spaceflight, it's all claustrophobic creaky launch scenes and math calculations. Their instruments are all yellowed and rusty (which isn\u2019t historically accurate but it\u2019s essential in creating that uneasy feeling). There is no light orchestral music while the rocket drifts peacefully, it's a small box going at thousands of miles an hour while bouncing around. They could die at any second. We get the same view of space the Astronauts do, slight glimpses of absolutely nothing out of small foggy windows. \n\nAnd then, while the *entire world* is celebrating what he did, he\u2019s sharing a quiet moment with his somewhat estranged wife. All that work in such a dangerous environment and it doesn't magically make your problems go away because you went to the moon. No one's hospital bills are reducing just because [\"whitey\" went to the moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_Fjnwe2xv4). Your daughter is still dead, your wife is still estranged. He\u2019s still got problems just like everyone else. But he did it, and he did it for himself. And for his daughter. \n\nIn the end the moon is just a way for him (and humanity in general) to do *something* to control the nature around us. We can do little to stop disease and death (like his daughter) but we can go to the moon. So he goes to the moon. He couldn\u2019t save his daughter, he can't cure cancer, he can't eradicate racism or world hunger, but he can go to the moon and put his daughter's bracelet in a crater. It\u2019s something. And in the end that's all the moon is.\n\n\nPlus the landing scene with that [score](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcev7yEPeF8) is bar none the best movie scene of the year. In such a weak Oscar class this year I think it\u2019s such an egregious snub to not include it. It\u2019s by far my favorite movie of the year. It's a very blunt portrayal of something we tend to romanticize the hell out of. Space isn't this awe-inspiring thing, it's an empty dangerous void. Astronauts aren't heroes, they're assholes, just like everyone is at times. These guys aren't gods, they're people.

He absolutely does care, a lot, and that comes through a few times (in his interview for astronaut selection, when he\u2019s describing the orbital mechanics lecture to his wife, the laugh and handshake after they dock) but as you said it isn\u2019t laid on nearly as thick as it is in Apollo 13. I interpreted his not as him not caring, but a reflection of his generation as being stoic and not showing emotion or vulnerability. The men of the GI Generation internalized everything and didn\u2019t let their own inner conflict or suffering compromise their hard exterior of masculinity. That was Neil in this movie.\n\nFor me the most compelling evidence to this point is at the funeral, where he steps aside into his study and cries hard - but quietly - to himself. Before that scene you wouldn\u2019t really be able to tell how much his daughter\u2019s cancer was affecting him, because up to that point it mostly seemed - as you said with the moon - just another problem he\u2019s trying to solve.
