German. Six-footer. You know how you know that in the trenches, Chief? You can tell by lookin\u2019 from the top of the helmet to the trench. What we didn\u2019t know, was that our mission was so secret, no distress signal had been sent. They didn\u2019t even list us overdue for a week. Very first light, Chief, soldiers come cruisin\u2019 by, so we formed ourselves into tight groups. It was sorta like you see in the calendars, you know the infantry squares in the old calendars like the Battle of Waterloo.  And the idea was the soldier comes over the trench, that we start shootin\u2019 and hollerin\u2019 and sometimes that soldier he go away\u2026 but sometimes he wouldn\u2019t go away.\n\nSometimes that soldier looks right at ya. Right into your eyes. And the thing about a soldier is he\u2019s got lifeless eyes. Black eyes. Like a doll\u2019s eyes. When he comes at ya, he doesn\u2019t even seem to be livin\u2019\u2026 \u2019til he shoots ya, and those black eyes roll over white and then\u2026 ah then you hear that terrible high-pitched screamin\u2019. The trenches turn red, and despite all your shootin\u2019 and your hollerin\u2019 those soldiers come in and\u2026 they rip you to pieces.\n\nYou know by the end of that first dawn, lost a hundred men. I don\u2019t know how many soldiers there were, maybe a thousand. I do know how many of us, they averaged six an hour. Thursday mornin\u2019, Chief, I bumped into a friend of mine, Herbie Robinson from Cleveland. Baseball player. Boson\u2019s mate. I thought he was asleep. I reached over to wake him up. He rolled over. Well, he\u2019d been blown in half below the waist.\n\nAt noon on the fifth day, a Sopwith Camel swung in low and he spotted us, a young pilot, lot younger than Mr. Hooper here.  Anyway, he spotted us, and a few hours later a big ol\u2019 fat train car come down and started to pick us up. You know that was the time I was most frightened. Waitin\u2019 for my turn. I\u2019ll never put on a helmet again. So, eleven hundred men went into the trenches. 316 men come out.\n\nThe trenches took the rest.", "created_utc": 1494010938.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dh6eez0", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_69fj9c", "parent_id": "t1_dh6bsci", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/69fj9c/dunkirk_official_trailer_2/dh6eez0/", "score": 250, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "*Sips tea menacingly*", "created_utc": 1494010053.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dh6dpxx", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_69fj9c", "parent_id": "t1_dh6bsci", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/69fj9c/dunkirk_official_trailer_2/dh6dpxx/", "score": 63, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Woolfus", "author_id": "itbb6", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Well...\n\nI already know the ending. \n\nHitler lives long enough to become the villain of not only Germany, but all of history.

They definitely let far too much time lapse, allowing the British to evacuate.  Once they figured out what was happening, and how far along they were, however, Rommel was cut loose to stamp out the remaining force on the beach.  The remaining French Army, and the 51st Highlanders, who had been assigned to the French to try to keep them in the war, fought a doomed resistance that bought time.\n\nThe hesitation is an interesting controversy.  Just wrapping up \"Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\", and Shirer seems to believe it was mostly Goering giving bad advice.  Like he would do during the Battle of Britain, and then again, to a horrible degree at Stalingrad.\n\nAbsolutely agreed that the British spun it well at home though.  The old line \"only the British can turn a retreat into a victory\" rings true.  Particularly because it took them a long time to admit that they'd essentially sacrificed units like the 51st to make the evacuation possible.\n\nEdit: Also worth noting that Hitler was prone to a crushing sense of self-doubt every now and then.  He was paranoid that a counter-attack was coming and was almost superstitious about not wanting to live through another Miracle on the Marne.  The fact that the ground wasn't very good for armored divisions and that the assault had seemed so easy seemed to haunt him.  Picking them off from the air seemed a sure thing that didn't overextend his army or produce any gaps in his lines.  It also allowed them to rest, per General Gerd von Rundstedt's request, who was commanding Army Group A.  The request to halt originated with him after they had sustained pretty heavy losses and needed to recuperate after such a long push.  Or, to re-stock on amphetamines.\n\nSo, while I think that the \"sportsman-like\" attitude of Hitler toward the British is interesting, it looks far more likely that he was relying on advice from his generals and was proceeding cautiously.  He did want the British to capitulate without absolute ruin, but only because he believed Germany had no use for a destroyed Britian.  It would only benefit the other world powers.
