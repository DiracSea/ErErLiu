My Great Uncle was a dear friend and had  worked with Peter, Brendan\u2019s dad, so he thought I\u2019d enjoy the opportunity. I got to know his parents over a few lunches and dinners, as well as spending time at their home. His mother showed me some of his childhood photos (as well as his siblings\u2019), shared some fun stories and doted on him, as any loving mother will do when she gets the chance. After dinner, we had coffee on their back deck, where we all set in chairs from his various movie-sets. I accidentally broke mine but his parents assured me it wasn\u2019t the first to break and put my embarrassment & panic at ease. I was still a teenager but his parents treated me with the respect of a young adult, they were inquisitive and encouraging and, of all my times out to Seattle and all the great things I have experienced out there, they always stand out at the top of the list.\n\nIn a recent interview about his disappearance from Hollywood, he mentions the death of his mother, Carol, and how it was a factor leading him into a depressive state. When I heard about her passing, it was almost as if I could feel their heartbreak from losing each other - parents understand the love others will have for their children but she also took so much joy in his pursuit of acting, he might as well have been the scientist that cures cancer or the first man on the moon. He didn\u2019t have to be the leading man that Hollywood\u2019s silver screen always touted - she was happy knowing he was a good man doing his best in whatever he did.\n\nI can\u2019t wait to see this movie and what else might be ahead for Brendan.
