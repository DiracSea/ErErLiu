Sam was a leader of a self-help group for PTSDvzt\n\n**The whole Marvel cinematic universe is about using powers responsibly and having a responsibility to use them -- and not use them -- when needed.**\n\nThey really got a lot of value out of the Spidey deal and the great power/responsibility lore -- it's like the Dude's rug, it ties everything together.

Because I'm really bored, let's do this.\n\n>Iron Man- Tony has Pepper fry Stane.  Murdered, but indirectly by overloading the arc reactor, also not done by the hero.\n\n>Hulk- Villain lives.\n\n>Iron Man 2- Vanko kills himself.\n\n>Thor- Villain lives.\n\n>Captain America: The First Avenger- Red Skull kills himself by handling the Tesseract.\n\n>The Avengers- Villain lives.\n\n>Iron Man 3- Pepper murders the main villain, this time directly by blowing his ass up.  Tony really likes using Pepper to kill villains, though Tony did murder the secondary antagonists earlier in the film.\n\n>Thor: The Dark World- Team effort to deliberately murder Malekith by dropping a ship on him.\n\n>Captain America: The Winter Soldier- Pierce killed directly by Fury.  Again, a deliberate murder, but not committed by the hero.  Winter Soldier survives.\n\n>Guardians of the Galaxy- Team effort to explode Ronan, deliberate murder, main act performed by main hero.\n\n>Avengers: Age of Ultron- I'm considering Ultron as alive here.  Final kill by Vision, deliberate.  I'm also assuming Vision actually killed Ultron (it's ambiguous due to phrasing and not seeing the actual kill).\n\n>Ant-Man- Killed by malfunctioning shrink tech.  Act done deliberately by the main hero, but outcome would have been unknown.  Counting it as a murder, he had to have been trying to kill Yellowjacket.\n\n>Captain America: Civil War- Villain lives, though he did try to an hero.\n\n>Doctor Strange- Villain lives, though they probably wish they hadn't.\n\nSo there we have it.  Fourteen films in, five villains live and two suicide.  Of the remaining seven, three of them die by the hand of someone other than the hero.  In the entire MCU, the only true acts of deliberate, malicious murder done by the main hero to the main villain are Thor 2, Ant-Man, and GotG.  However, not a single one of them have any qualms about killing random soldiers and have impressively high body counts.

Who was he telling to \"listen\" to him? He sacrificed himself because he knew that was the only small window of opportunity he had where he was still in control of his body.
