Jessica was her name. Really pretty, she had a southern voice and could make a one syllable word like Hi go for three syllables. She had dirty blonde hair, she was rail thin, almost unhealthy thin, bright blue eyes that would sparkle but you could tell were also hiding some pain. I wanted to know her story so bad.\n\nShe wasn't the kind of girl I normally fell for. My wife and previous girls I had dated were always put together- hair done, nails done, teeth whitened, Jesus loving women, clothes ironed and perfectly coiffed. Jessica wasn't. At all. Jessica was street.\n\nTwenty something for sure but street adds miles to your face so she looked thirties. I wondered what she looked like without the hat on. I would give anything to see her beautiful blue eyes staring back fron the other side of the booth at a different restaurant, not Hardees, not here in the grit but at a nice restaurant just me and her. She liked to tuck her dirty blonde hair behind her hat, two small tattoos, one on each wrist. Occassionally a bruise, sometimes you could tell it was all she could do to just get there. One Monday i saw track marks on her arm and i took my food outside and sat in my car and cried. I didnt know anything about Jessica really except thst she was kind, so kind to me, at a time when I needed a kind smile more than anything else in the world.\n\nI felt guilty because I was married but there was such a spark between us. I loved the Thickburgers but I also loved going to that Hardees so much, I was going there two or three times a week sometimes driving past two or three Hardees to get to that downtown one, my favorite spot. Most fast food you order and stand up there waiting for it, but at Hardees you go sit down with a number and they bring it to you. Jessica always brought me mine, every time. I would place my order and go sit down at my favorite booth. It was so warm in that Hardees, I don't know why they kept it so unseasonably warm but I loved it. I would take my coat off and stamp the snow off my boots and collapse into my favorite booth by the window and stare outside at the snow piling down and that frozen January wind whipping thru the icy trees until my thoughts were interrupted by beautiful Jessica bringing me my food. Every once in a while Jessica would bring me my food and sit down in the booth across from me. I loved those days so much, I lived for those days. I remembered some weekends wishing it was Monday and I could sit at that warm booth by myself and read my book while the snow was falling to be interrupted only by Jessica and the off chance that she would sit down at the booth across from me. She always had to go though, she needed the job and she needed the hours and the money just to get by. I could take her away from all this. I had American Currency.\n\nDo you need eeeeeeehhhhhny thaaaang else?\n\nShe would say in that gorgeous southern draw. If I would have known it was her last day i would have told her how i felt. I would have asked her to sit across the booth from me one last time. No small talk just smiles. Just kind smiles with upturned lips and sparkling blue eyes. The kind of eyes that say i know you have a secret and im going to get it out of you. But i didnt know it would be the last day i would ever see Jessica. No one did. She left my life suddenly the same way she came in. The news reports said she was in the wrong place at the wrong time, a mother of two beautiful little mixed girls, no witnesses to the shooting, an all too common occurrence in that area.\n\nI always imagined myself saying yes, I need you to run away with me, let's leave all this behind. Your job in service and your overbearing boss and your life caught in a cycle of poverty and my job in the cubicle and terrible marriage to the well coiffed woman with the white teeth and the $300 haircuts.\n\nWhat the fuck are we doing with our lives?\n\nWe can leave it all behind right now. Ive got a fast car. We can drive away to the Gulf Shores together. Who cares where we work, at night we'll go home together to our worn down shack and put up the string lights and dance to Otis Redding and laugh, the only two people in the world. We'll take the BBQ off the grill and crack open some beers and watch the sun go down and the storm clouds come thru in a hurry. We werent paying attention to the rain of course. I was sitting outside on my favorite lawn chair and you were sitting on my lap in those favorite cut off shorts I love and i was kissing the back of your neck as we listened to Otis sing about the pain and the thrill.\n\nShit! Rain! We both say.\n\nAnd we jump up and grab the clothes off the line and throw everything inside. We throw everything on the floor because we don't care. Something about hard rain and hot Alabama nights that drives us wild. You lock the door behind you and take off your top and it's just your short jean shorts and your tan body and your black bra and your wet short dirty blond hair dripping with water tucked behind your ears. You turn up Otis all the way until he is screaming These Arms of Mine. It doesnt matter, we are all alone, the only two people in the world and you tease me with the come here motion while simultaneously running away. Who Me? I say as I smile coyly. It such an easy smile, no cameras pointing at me, no stress no worries just me and you in a tiny house by the Gulf with no air conditioning just Windows thrown open to feel the salty air and the Gulf Breeze.\n\nI finally catch you in the bedroom and kiss your neck again how you like it and we put our wet bodies together and hold each other tight, the only two people in the world until we collapse exhausted and spent from wet passionate desperately wanting love. You lie on my chest and we listen to the rain fall loudly on the tin roof and we both drift off, asleep but still smiling the smiles of the content, two people with the rest of our lives ahead of us knowing we can do this again tomorrow if we want and for the rest of our lives.\n\nThat's what I need when you say do you need anything else. I need you to run away with me right now from everything and leave this frozen wasteland behind.\n\nHello?\n\nHello?\n\nShe said smiling and waiving her hand in front of my face. Where did you go there?\n\nOh sorry, no I don't need anything else I say.\n\nAnd Jessica walked away and out of my life forever.\n\n", "created_utc": 1551984661.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "ei0h6fx", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_aycy6z", "parent_id": "t1_ei0e7bm", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/aycy6z/first_photo_of_kumail_nanjiani_and_dave_bautista/ei0h6fx/", "score": 59, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Ask_me_4_a_story", "author_id": "127rj7", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I went to Jamaica once. Friend of mine got a huge settlement from a class action lawsuit against the company that made the anti-depressant he'd been on since he was 12. He wanted to go to a place where drugs were semi-legal, and he wanted a drug-friendly friend to meet him down there for a few nights, and he wanted these things bad enough to pay for my plane ticket and a room at a resort, so I went.\n\nWhen I got down there, he called me and said that he was detained because he didn't have a passport \u2014 he'd only brought a photocopy of his birth certificate, and they told him he had to fly back and get the original document. He told me to just go to the resort and wait for him for a couple days. So I got on an empty bus at the airport and told the driver the name of the resort (Jackie's On The Reef). He bitched that it was really far, but agreed to take me.\n\nThe ride there was completely insane. There didn't seem to be any traffic laws whatsoever, and if there were, people ignored them entirely. We were barreling down barely paved roads with no lane dividers, and whole families with kids and shit were walking and riding bikes on this road, not caring at all if someone came within millimeters of killing them. The driver didn't seem to care either. He'd already sold me what had to be half a pound of weed rolled up in a torn black Hefty bag for 10 bucks, so I was doing my best not to seem like a pussy when a chicken ran out into the road and got fucking destroyed under the bus's wheels. Looking into the rear-view at the cloud of white feathers behind us, the bus driver caught my shocked suburban expression and said, \"Farmah should'na let im owt da coop, ha ha ha.\"\n\nI learned several things about Jamaica on this 3-hour death ride that I had no clue about until I got there. For one, large parts of Jamaica look like a straight up third-world country. The resorts are all really nice and expensive-looking, but they're fenced off by large concrete walls and wrought-iron gates. Some of the people that lived in this part of Jamaica (just blocks from Hedonism II or whatever the fuck) were living in shantys. Like actual shantys with pieced-together plywood walls and big wavy pieces of metal tacked on as a roof. At one point we stopped to take a leak at one of these shantys, which I found out was a kind of convenience store (they sold cigarettes and chicken). It had a clean, dimly-lit outhouse, which I happily used. When I got out, there was a six-year-old kid standing there in his tighty-whities, eating a bare burger patty with his fingers. He asked me if I wanted to meet some girls tonight.\n\nAfter a couple more hours on the bus and a few dozen more brushes with death (it's dark now), we arrive at Jackie's. I get off the bus and thank the driver. He says, \"Mon why you wan go dere? Fuck Jackie's on da Re-iff. Wen you wan go someplace goot, you call me\" and hands me his card. He says, \"Dey all know me,\" and closed the door, gunning the bus off into the dark. The card was a torn piece of brown cardboard with the words \"CAPTAIN MIDNIGHT\" hand-written in sharpie. There was no phone number.\n\n*\n\nI turn around and walk towards Jackie's.  The entrance was a thin dirt path lined by huge Jurassic Park-looking plants. The path came to a stop at a 6-foot iron gate.  (The other thing I learned about Jamaica is that there are no fucking lights *anywhere*.)  I go to open the gate when I realize there's a person directly in front of me, standing in the dark on the other side.  \n\n\"Are you...Joe?\" The voice seemed like it was coming from a lone white afro hovering about five feet in the air.\n\n\"Yes,\" I said.  \"Are you Jackie?\"\n\n\"I am,\" said the hovering afro.  \"Your friend had some trouble at customs.  He's not that bright, is he?  He should be here in two days.  We'll keep you busy until then.\"\n\n\"Wait... Why don't you have an accent?,\" I said, regretting it the moment it came out.  She stopped unlocking the gate to ponder what I could possibly mean by that, and then (correctly) guessed that this stupid white kid had only come into contact with *Jamaican* black people up until this point in his trip.\n\n\"*Because I'm an American*,\" she said.\n\n* \n\nShe opened the gate and led me down to the resort, telling me about the rules as we walked.\n\n\"We are fully organic and sustainable here.  We collect fresh water when it rains, so we ask that when you go number one, you do not flush your toilet.  Try and keep your showers to under 4 minutes.  Yoga begins at seven, eleven, and five \u2014 meals are served one half hour after.  We ask that you *do not* be late for yoga \u2014 our yogis are very sought-after and I don't like to waste their time.\"\n\n...Yog***is***?  It occurred to me that my friend Dan, whom I'd not seen for several years by this point, must have gotten into some seriously serene shit to book this place.  The last time we hung out was at some stupid house party where he was christening a six-foot bong from on top of a kitchen stool, lighting it with a struck match between his toes.\n\n\"There are some other guests here this week, but they'll be leaving tomorrow.  They're down by the bonfire.  They're sweet, so don't be scared to talk to them.\"  \n\nShe led me to the bonfire and got someone to take my bags.  We sat down with the other guests, who were indeed nice.  All three of them were 40's-ish American black ladies.  I wondered to myself when their husbands would be joining us. \n\nJackie introduces me and we exchange pleasantries.  The ladies talk and joke and banter in a way that only black women do and I am wholly enthralled by it.  Jackie and these women have apparently known each other for years.  The guests smile and whisper to each other every once in a while, looking at me in a way that struck me as overtly flirtatious.  \n\nSomeone from the resort comes and tells Jackie that they need her.  Jackie tells me that she'll be going to bed soon anyway and that she'll see me at yoga in the morning.  I say goodnight.\n\nAfter she leaves, one of the ladies says, \"This place is nice, huh?  How'd you find it?\"\n\n\"My friend found it online.  He'll be here soon.\"\n\n\"Your friend is a guy?,\" she asked, looking a little disappointed.\n\n\"Yeah...\"\n\n\"Well,\" she said, \"Now's as good a time as any.\"  The other two ladies are now visibly stifling laughter.\n\n\"For what...?,\" I said, scared.\n\n\"To get in touch with your inner black woman,\" she said, triggering a deluge of hysterics from the other two.  One of them was stamping her feet on the ground and tearing up, going \"mm MMM mm MMM\" and shaking her head.  \"You know where you are, right?  I mean, y'all prolly wanna call your friend and let him know he booked you at a yoga retreat for middle-aged ladies of color.\"\n\n\n", "created_utc": 1552066021.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "ei2z16j", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_aycy6z", "parent_id": "t1_ei0e7bm", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/aycy6z/first_photo_of_kumail_nanjiani_and_dave_bautista/ei2z16j/", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "the_joy_of_VI", "author_id": "170vqz", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Thanks.
