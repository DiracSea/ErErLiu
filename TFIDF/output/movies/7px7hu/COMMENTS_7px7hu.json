A bunch of things really contribute to the Nelix hate, but the writing itself sets him up to fail. It's a real shame since he's supposed to be a character you like and enjoy watching grow as a person. He spends too much time at the forefront of your mind as \"that annoying dick,\" because for a long time *he is,* AND he's always being forced into episodes with nothing to do with him thanks to running the mess (which is like the second most used set other than the bridge,) or used as the butt of a joke because \"Nelix' cooking,\" is a running joke. You never get to *not* deal with Nelix for an episode, and the crew's perception of him is set up to turn you against him.\n\nAnother part of the problem is that Nelix has by far the most drastic personal growth to overcome. Voyager is about growth as a person. Tom growing up and becoming a responsible adult and father, Harry growing up into a fine officer and commander, Seven rediscovering her humanity, The Doctor discovering his own humanity... All of these things are basically \"one step,\" problems. Nelix has to learn to become *someone else,* from who he already became in life. It's much more than just growing into who you are, it's changing who you've already become as a person.
