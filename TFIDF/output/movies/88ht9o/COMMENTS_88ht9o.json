I can only think of 1 or 2 cases of talkers in movies that really irritated me in the last year when I go alone. When I go with friends however it almost always becomes a fight because they love to talk, use their phone, and use Snapchat with the flash on......\n\nThere have been multiple times they have left the theater because I haven't been very kind to them. I don't care honestly. They way I see it is I spent $10 to see a movie and so did they. Their money isn't any more valuable than mine. And if they wanna waste it by walking out of a theater before the movie is finished, be my guest. \n\nI don't understand paying money to see a movie in the background while you sit on your phone the whole time. And what I really don't understand is their excuses for it. They say things like:\n\n\"I have to keep my phone on in case (insert family member here) needs me!\" Ok, then why even come to the movie to begin if they potentially need you?\n\n\"It's just one quick snap I promise\" I don't care if it's one or eight. Turn the damn phone off. \n\n\"The screen was on minimum brightness!\" It's almost pitch black in this theater! Even minimum brightness with the blue light filter turned on is visible!! \n\n\"I just don't really like the movie.\" Ok, you see that over there? That's the door. You can walk out just as easily as you walked in. Use it. \n\nI honestly think this comes down to the whole argument of especially in teens they feel entitled. \"It's my money that I used for the ticket so I should get to be on MY phone whenever I want.\" That may sound like an over-exaggerated comment but I have literally been told that before by friends. \n\nMovie talkers are worse. There are 3 cases of movie talkers that I honestly couldn't understand any less than I already dont. \n\n1. People who translate a movie from English into whatever language the person next to them speaks.\n\n2. Nitpicking assholes who feel the need to make every little comment they can think of because they saw Cinema Sins or Screen Junkies do it.\n\n3. Children. I can not stand children who are in a R rated film/any non-animated kids film because their parents think that the kids will keep themselves entertained. Why the hell even bring them?\n\nIf you have to translate the movie verbally then wait until the DVD/Blu-ray release and watch it with subtitles.\n\nDon't nitpick a movie during a movie. I know you think it makes you sound brilliant. But, 9/10 times you'll be proved to be an idiot after the movie because a comment you made at minute 15 will be proven wrong by minute 20. \n\nI don't know any other way to put it so I'll put it like this. Keep. Your. Kids. At. Home. I personally think any child under the age of 8 shouldn't be allowed into any PG-13 or R-Rated film. I think it would eliminate lots of problems.
