[{"body": "We've been getting a lot of spoiler reports on this post so I wanted to remind every one what /r/movies spoiler policy is. \n\nWe draw the line of spoilers at anything that is announced by the studio. This includes press releases and official trailers/posters. We do this for three reasons. 1) We have to draw the line somewhere and doing a case by case basis would be impossible 2) If it's revealed in one trailer or release you can guarantee it will be in many others (see robot John Connor in Terminator: Genisys) and 3) if we were to say that any mention of Vader in Rogue One is a spoiler then we have to remove every comment, poster, trailer, and any other mention of that fact for the rest of time.\n\nWe know it sucks when studios ruin a big reveal but ultimately if you are spoiler phobic then you need to accept that studios will spoil things now and in the future. It is asking too much for us to remove big film news just for those who wish to go in completely cold. The best thing to do is to instal RES and filter out any Star Wars phrases or other news till the film comes out. \n\nAs for now this stays and we hope you understand why.

They tried this in 1998, and this (among other things) left the audience conflicted and unwilling to care at all.\n\nInstead, Edward's Godzilla is a study in scale... both visually and thematically. The visual clues are obvious, but I think beginning with Cranston; loud and in our face and then transitioning to milder and more archetypical characters puts Godzilla front and center. \n\nWhile I do agree that Cranston's death felt unceremonious and rushed, I think it was meant to begin transitioning the main characters to background characters. Cranston's served as a hook for the audience early on. He's charismatic and delivers some important exposition and by killing him, we're left following his less charismatic son... it may seem disappointing, but I think the intent was to get the audience to 'let go' of the humans in favor of the real, bigger story: Godzilla vs. Mutos! Sort of like adjusting the lens of a camera from macro to wide angle.\n\nMaybe they didn't pull it off all that well because your complaint is valid and common, but I think at least it was a bold move!", "created_utc": 1466723733.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d4lhho0", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_4phpcc", "parent_id": "t1_d4ld3mc", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/4phpcc/james_earl_jones_confirmed_as_voice_of_darth/d4lhho0/", "score": 14, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "NedryWasFramed", "author_id": "tsnko", "subreddit_name": "movies"}]
