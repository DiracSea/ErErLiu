JW2 they literally make him bulletproof, even if that was a badass scene where he gets his suit.\n\n\nThe villain was generic as hell too. Atleast in JW1, the mob boss was different in a way. He wasnt just making deals and double crossing cause he was evil. It helped sell JW as a badass more than having him shoot 3 guys in the head coming around the corner.
