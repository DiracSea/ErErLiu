It's not even the totality of American filmmaking, referring to it as behaving one way then behaving another is ridiculous. As Aaron Sorkin said, it's hard to find two people in LA in the same room who agree with one another. So \"After years of racism and sexism...\" is blaming one person for something someone else did.\n\nSo \"Hollywood\" doing one thing then later doing another is just \"Some People did X,\" then \"Other People did Y.\" There is no homogeneous coordinated effort to what you're complaining about.\n\n2) Most artists want to feel like they're working on something good, doing good. Most actors are liberal. Once you spend a few decades investigating the human condition, you start empathizing with evil and you get much softer on crime, you empathize with the plight of immigrants, you're more tolerant toward social outcasts like gay people, transgender, etc. You are actively choosing to watch a liberal industry, so complaining that it's liberal is an oxymoron.\n\nRemember Silicon Valley, that episode where everyone kept saying they were changing the world through various GUI improvements? Same shit. Nearly every industry that makes something wants to think that they're spending their time doing something worthwhile. And sometimes - they are.\n\n3) Pop Culture, which includes movies, influences the world. We literally saw the #metoo movement take off with movies. It didn't start with Roger Ailes, or Bill O'Reilly, or Bill Clinton or Donald Trump- it started with movies. Film, TV, and literature are influential. It's undeniable. Hell, movies are so great that even though you know they're all liberal and want to make you all nicer people who don't hate immigrants and follow your dreams of being poets or whatever - you'll still digest their product. You even, for some random ass reason, even watched promotional material for *A Wrinkle In Time*. 919 views on that video. More people have seen this thread than watched that crap.\n\n4) When a studio greenlights a movie, the people who greenlighted usually aren't the people in the promo videos you're watching on youtube. It's, again, another case of Some People doing one thing, and Other People doing another, and you blaming everyone involved. Oprah wanted to do a nice movie. She's pretty selective.

They did it for profit. \n\nIs that really true, though? I mean, it does better mankind, in a way. Yes, we shouldn't care that this movie is basically an exercise in casting minorities and enforcing diversity. That would be ideal. But we do happen to live in a world where that doesn't happen that often, at least not until recently. I think I often assume this too. That the underlying argument is \"this didn't happen because so many people are racist\" (and that probably is often the underlying argument). But they can be wrong in the reason behind a valid observation. There are not very many females that get to direct big budget movies. There are even fewer females that are in a racial/ethnic minority. Maybe it's because everybody is conspiring against them (it's not so simple) or maybe it's because there just aren't that many trying and it just hasn't happened much yet (it's not so simple). Whatever the reason is, when it does happen, there's no way it is a bad thing and a lot of reasons to consider it a good thing. So when it happens, why should it not get pointed out?\n\nIt's not necessarily \"we're saving minorities from evil white people\", it's more like they are are paving the way to a certain future. They are making a big budget movie that relies pretty heavily on actors that are minorities, which by definition make up a smaller portion of the audience they hope to captivate, which by definition is a risk.\n\nAnd more generally, why would somebody making a movie not celebrate it period? What do you expect? They need to market it.\n\nWith that being said, the way Black Panther (which I want to see but haven't seen yet) was approached annoyed me quite a bit too, but for a slightly different reason. A lot of the reaction to it was almost people literally saying \"Aw, that's cute, they have their own superhero movies now. Oh, Blade came out 20 years ago? We mean one that can be taken seriously. Don't even mention Blankman...\"\n\nI think the same could apply to A Wrinkle in Time. But, even if some people are being patronizing, that doesn't make the result a bad thing.

I hate Disney. Marvel movies are repetitive drivel that has infected the entire western film making landscape. Remakes and reboots were already on the rage but the concept of a \"cinematic universe\" really put the nail in the coffin for creativity and new ideas in Hollywood. Does anyone remember the 20-50 million dollar movie? How many great movies from the 70s-90s made for an equivalent budget are some of the all time classics? Thrillers, character dramas, horror movies? These movies still get made but much less frequently and to substantially less financial success. \n\nPeople by and large are simply not interested in \"wasting\" their 3-4 yearly trips to the cinema on a psychological thriller that they don't know much about when they can instead go watch Generic marvel movie #535 and be guaranteed certain elements (quips, action, the same characters, a plot requiring literally 0 thought etc). Of course, if you enjoy these movies, I have no issue with you spending your own money to see them, it just fucking blows that the saturation of the movie landscape by comic book movies and nostalgia snooze fests like the new Star Wars movies and especially something like Ready Player One has to come at the expense of having a diverse selection of films.\n\nWhat kills me, though, is that even the movies that don't fit this mold have in recent years become so fucking wrapped up in western social issues (racism, sexism, LGBT etc) that despite the variation in plots/concepts, the same messages and beats are omnipresent. Just look at the oscars nominations for the past 5 years. SO many movies are like this. Not every movie starring a woman needs to have her be a generic strong female character.

The problem with your argument is that you think women/minorities/the disabled are somehow inherently less qualified, and the only reason they're being hired is because the company has some quota to meet. But how many places are actually finding *unqualified* minority candidates, instead of trying harder to find minority candidates who are in fact qualified, but have been overlooked for a variety of systemic reasons? E.g. Hollywood wasn't shafting black or female protagonists bc talented black and female actors didn't exist, they were shafting them bc they thought they were unprofitable, and have now been proven wrong. \n\nAlso, even if it were \"for diversity's sake,\" there's a snowball effect when people see themselves properly represented. Someone brought up STEM fields now pushing for more women as an example. Smart, qualified women have always existed in STEM, but get pushed out of the process largely because of the sexism they face (for example... assuming they are unqualified and a \"diversity hire\" bc they are women). Making an effort to recruit and keep more women will help combat the college or company culture that is making it so hostile to women, leading to more and more women feeling like they can stay in STEM. So even *if* those women weren't recruited in sincerity, there is a net positive effect for them being there. Basically, I agree with u/SaveComplete, I don't care about their motivation because they're still doing the right thing. \n\nI just think a lot of people wanna white knight the underrepresented groups by going \"they should have hired you because they ACTUALLY WANT YOU, not to meet some quota!!\"... without realizing that they are now automatically assuming that these groups are less desirable and that no one could possibly want to recruit them in sincerity.

Also, having a woman as the hero, supports the status quo; instead of the women of the film being the bad guys, they're good guys on *our* team.
