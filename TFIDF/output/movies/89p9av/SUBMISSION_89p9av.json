However recently there has been an even greater shift as Hollywood is trying to pretend that every film released is a great charitable service rather than just trying to make money.\nI recently saw an interview with Oprah Winfrey for A Wrinkle in Time and it is sickening how many of the world's injustices they claim to be fixing.  For reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9jknmSBsMc \nIt's a great book and might even be a great movie but promoting it like this is nauseating. Disney did not spend $103 million on this film to better mankind. They did it for profit. \nI really wish they'd stop patting themselves on the back and acting so altruistic as a marketing tool for such a money hungry enterprise. Particularly in light of it being a direct response to their own sordid industry.\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "title": "After years of sexism and racism, Hollywood is now trying to act like every film featuring a female or minority is a public service rather than a multi million dollar profit making industry.", "url": null, "author_name": "AaronAart209", "author_id": "oajxz", "subreddit_name": "movies", "upvote_ratio": 0.79}
