I don't think I've ever seen green-cabbage jiaozi before.\n\nMy parents chop the cabbage with a food processor--it needs to be done finely. Make sure to squeeze the water out, you don't want the filling to be wet. \n\nCumin and 5spice is kinda weird for jiaozi/baozi/wonton. The kind of pepper we use is actually \"sichuan peppercorn\". Get the powdered stuff, try to get the reddish-brown powder--I recently bought a greenish sichuan peppercorn powder and it's not the same, though it'll do just fine. \n\nThe meat you want to use is pork. 100% pork, not too lean if you have an option. \n\n*****\n\nMy parents made wrappers from all-purpose flour and water. The dough should not be too hard and dense--that's for wontons. Man, I can't describe to you how soft the dough should be. Store bought wrappers are definitely too hard, though they don't really have a choice since they gotta package and ship the darn things. Jiaozi wrappers are circular. They are... not easy to make. The animation in the Pixar short is accurate in terms of steps, but not in terms of time needed lol. Usually, after kneading the dough but before turning the ball of dough into a ring, they'll let the dough sit a while.\n\n*****\n\nBoiling the jiaozi. This is important, don't screw up here.\n\nThe thing about jiaozi is, they're delicate.\n\nSo, depending on the size of the pot, you'll want to dump as much as will cover the surface of the water, into the pot of already-boiling water. You can put less, but don't put more.\n\nYou will now juggle 3 balls while balancing on a rubber ball.\n\nFirst thing is, you need to keep the jiaozi from sitting on the bottom of the pot. They can slide around on the bottom--they will--but if they stay in one spot the dough will stick to the pot. And use a pot for chrissake, not a pan, you need a fair bit of water, so that when you dump the room-temp jiaozi in, the water doesn't change temperature all that much. My parents always boiled in a stainless steel pot--I don't know if there's entire boiling pots lined with nonstick material, I've only seen pans.\n\nSo you want to stir them, to keep them moving, but you can't stir too hard or else they'll break.\n\nAt the same time, you can't be too delicate with your stirring because you want that lid on the pot as much as possible--you want the water to reach boiling again ASAP. So you stir in a circle, you put the lid on, when the jiaozi stop moving, you take off the lid and stir, etc...\n\nI mean if you have a 2-phase induction stovetop that can pump 7kw of heat straight into your pot then good for you, buuut you probably don't, so hence the balancing act.\n\nThe other balancing act is a bit more simple. You'll want to keep a large bowl of cold water. When the water comes to a boil, pour in a half cup to a cup of it into the pot, you don't want the water to stay boiling or else your dumplings will burst (or break due to the convection currents)\n\nSo you'll be stirring and taking the lid off and on, then the water comes to a boil, you pour in the cold water, it stops boiling, you resume stirring and lidding.\n\nUsually, 3 pours of the cold water is good enough. Like, by the time of your second pour, or maybe slightly afterwards, your jiaozi should be floating. Floating is good, it means they're done. \n\n*****\n\nThen you put the boiled jiaozi onto a plate, using a strainer to collect them or something. You *could* use a colander, I guess. \n\n*****\n\nYou serve the dumplings with Chinese light soysauce and Chinese vinegar. Sometimes the soysauce has minced garlic mixed into it--this is omitted for fillings that have chives, since chives and garlic are both in the *Allium* family so that would make it too garlicky. Unless that's your thing.
