The main problem has been the writing.  \n\nIt's one thing to see a guy do something impossible and amazing to get out of a situation, but they have the protagonists in god mode.  They are never in danger.  Same thing happened with the Die Hard franchise.  You could make those forever, but when you are taking down fighter jets with a semi-truck, that's a road too far.  Keep it simple, keep it fun, and give it just a bit of edge.  Make a billion bux.\n\nI blame special effects.  There are no limitations to what they can put on the screen, but they go way too big and it ends up a headache.  Give me a good sword fight at the end and I'm happy.  They don't need to be fighting in a whirlpool the size of Kansas if they got some decent stakes and some build up.\n\nSince I'm on a rant and I'm half drunk...Look at how cool Robo-Cop, Predator, and Ghostbusters were...then watch the remakes.  They had 10x the special effects and forgot to make characters you give half a shit about.  \n\nLook at guardians of the galaxy...everything Groot does has mad weight.  He don't hardly really do shit, and all he says is I am Groot, but I care about that piece CGI more than real people in other movies.  I can relate to rocket raccoon!  That's how dumb some of these movies are getting.  They aren't small budget movies either.  They will spend 150-200 million dollars on a movie and never make a plot.  \n\nBatman V Superman straight up don't even form a coherent thought.  How can you do all that and spend all that money and it ends up being just stuff happening.\n\nLike wtf was up with doomsday?  Why he do that?  How was he gonna stop it after it killed Superman?  Did it follow his directions?  Was he controlling it?  How Lex Luthor know Batman was Bruce Wayne?  That's a SECRET!  You can't just know who Batman is as a given, you gotta show me how you figured that shit out.  But really...How did Lois Lane know they needed that spear thing she threw in the water?

I thought celestials were old beings and Ego was the last of them, as per Kurt Russell in guardians of the galaxy 2\n\nIf you've seen Guardians of the Galaxy, there's a brief shot of the Celestial [Eson the Searcher](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/marvelcinematicuniverse/images/b/b7/Esonsearcher.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/310?cb=20141126104220) when the Guardians meet the collector. He's the huge dude with the staff that wields the power stone.\n\nThe Celestials are quasi-Lovecraftian space gods created by Jack Kirby. Their defining characteristics are being silent and being really huge, with the smallest standing as tall as mountains and the largest being so big they can stand on a planet and have their head poke out of the atmosphere.\n\nThe Celestials visit planets in groups called Hosts to genetically engineer and experiment on life for reasons known only to them. Multiple Celestial hosts have visited Earth in the past, each time erasing all memory of their visits and existence from human minds. The Celestial Hosts are so powerful that Odin could not fight them alone and ended up calling together all the other \"skyfather\" pantheon heads to challenge them. This confrontation ended with Odin and the others *surrendering* and agreeing to stay out of the Celestials' way.\n\nThe Celestials are to the cosmos as a whole what the Asgardians are to Earth.\n\nThe MCU may, however, have expanded \"celestial\" to include beings beyond Kirby's creations. Ego the Living Planet is a celestial in the MCU but is not a celestial in the comics. However, the version of Ego found in the MCU, basically an energy being that manipulates matter around him, is not inconsistent with previous depictions of Celestials, who are pure energy under their gargantuan armor.\n\nEdit: This panel from Earth X shows how freaking big Celestials can be.\n\nhttps://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11112/111122896/4783077-j856bdp.jpg", "created_utc": 1546333034.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1546333218.0, "id": "ed04ctm", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_abcfgt", "parent_id": "t1_eczvfqn", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/abcfgt/johnny_depps_exit_from_upcoming_pirates_of_the/ed04ctm/", "score": 37, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Kniwehere...

Is the film a tentpole? Tentpole films (A Harry Potter, Avengers, James Bond, Jurassic Park, Star Wars, Fast and the Furious, LOTR, etc) have more resources dedicated to them, and opening weekends and choosing the star is more dependent on 'star power', so having more famous people in these big films are important, since the attention of their name and their built in fans can draw people to a film. If the film isn't a tentpole then it needs to be artistically compelling in some way and they will talk to actors who are attracted to the material, these films are less important financially and can afford to take losses since they are made for awards, and to build careers and prestige. \n\n2. Is it a sequel? Sequels are designed to outperform the first film, it's a proven formula now, and has a fanbase and the actor has more power to negotiate for a larger salary, audiences might be disappointed if their favorite actor doesn't return and they have to get used to a new actor, so actors can demand more. \n\n3. Do they have an appeal for certain dedicated markets or for certain demographics? For instance is the studio hoping to get a film into the Chinese market? An actor with a big fanbase there, or a Chinese national might be compelling for a film to recruit, they could know their importance for the film financially and argue for a pay increase. \n\n4. Do they have other films that want them at the same time? If they are going to take 6 months to shoot a gigantic and demanding blockbuster, they could have shot 2 or 3 smaller films and maybe gotten 5-10 million apiece for those films, so they are missing out on 10-30 million, so to make sure the big film can compete with how much they could have potentially made in the same time period. Also if another big film wants them and has committed to offering them 20-30 million, then a competing film needs to offer them a better deal, greater pay, a portion of revenues, or a film that is more interesting or less physically demanding, etc. \n\n5. Do they have a huge social media following? How do their films typically perform? The size of the fanbase and the performance of their previous films are factored in. \n\n6. How good are the negotiators on both sides? If the Actors representation is able to make a good case based on the above that their actor is worth more than the production company is offering, they may very well get a pay boost. How badly they are needed and how good their negotiators are all matter.
