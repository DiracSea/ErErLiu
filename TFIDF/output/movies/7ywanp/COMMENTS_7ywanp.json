This is long. I didn\u2019t mean to write all this, strap in. \n\nI need to preface this. I\u2019m a cook. I\u2019m studying to be a chef. I love my job. I like finding new burns on my arms I don\u2019t remember getting. I enjoy knowing that in any given room I walk into I\u2019m probably one of the few who has ever had to tape his fingertips back on in the middle of a double (on Mother\u2019s Day, no less)  and was tough enough to shrug it off. I like working in often grimy environments, doing grimy jobs, with grimy people. This industry is a good fit for me. So, as much as I LOVE this film and others like it; a word of caution. It is heavily romanticized; and while there\u2019s little to nothing I can point to and say \u201cthat\u2019s wrong\u201d with the film, the portrayal still isn\u2019t entirely \u201cright\u201d. Ratatouille correctly displays a certain perspective on this life of ours, that anyone with a genuine love for the kitchen and all her sadistic, seductive charms will instantly identify with. Just don\u2019t kid yourself into believing that\u2019s *all* we do. Anyways. \n\n I watched this in the Theatre with my Grandmother when I was little. I can distinctly remember being enamored with the world of the kitchen. Psychotic, violent, loving, artistic, brutal, unforgiving, and familial. It intimidated and enchanted me in equal measures. I felt like I had been let in on a great secret; hidden in plain sight was this chaotic, hectic world where men and women sustained  a pseudo-bohemian lifestyle making *art*. Something that I, having been raised in an environment very much stuck in the 50\u2019s in regards to it\u2019s perspective on \u201cThe Workin\u2019 Man\u201d found breathtaking. I was simultaneously enamored with the concept and entirely confident I would never have an opportunity to be apart of it. \n\nYears later, out of High School, I took a job as a server in my friend\u2019s restaurant. His family owned a little cafe near the community college, nothing especially impressive when compared to it\u2019s peers, but it was nice. Cozy. One day, the owner (my friend\u2019s mother) pulls the both of us aside. Aside from herself, she had only one steady cook on staff. We\u2019ll call him J. J, she explained, was a very lovely man. He was caring, kind, and *wanted* desperately to make it in the industry . . . The only problem was, he was an abysmal cook. So she made a very simple proposal. She was going to have to let J go, and one of us would have to move to BOH (back-of-house, for the unaware). My friend was taking more college credits than I was at the time (and was also fully aware of his mother\u2019s Napoleonic tendencies) so the job fell to me. \n\nInitially, I was awful. I knew nothing about cooking, hardly five minutes would go by without me having to ask for clarification in some simple task. *\u201dHow should I arrange the Bacon on the Sheet-tray?\u201d* *\u201d How should I hold the knife?\u201d *\u201dDoes this sausage look burnt to you?\u201d* It most certainly was, by the way).  But, through a combination of desperation on my part and manipulation on hers, I stuck with it; eventually becoming what I believed to be a vital and important part of the business. It took around two years for things to sour between us. \n\nNow, the family I had worked for had always displayed intensely dysfunctional behavior. Screaming matches in front of their children was a common, even expected, occurrence; perhaps worthy of a passing glance and sigh if it was a real mean one. I was constantly under scrutiny for every life decision I made, from my non-existent relationship to god, to my occasional use of Marijuana ( which she once comically insisted to me would leave me permanently impaired; citing a brief interaction she had with some stoner when she was in college that \u201ccouldn\u2019t remember his own name\u201d. She encouraged me to smoke cigarettes instead, and I finally dropped *that habit* earlier this year), even to the fact that I went to counseling and took Prozac for my depression. I was often provoked to the point of tears, and once to an attempted suicide attempt. I attempted to carve out my forearm with a box-knife, in the wake of a bad lunch rush. When I failed to do so, because we never changed the damned things and it was fuller than a butter knife, I burst into a fit of uncontrollable laughter that lasted a little over an hour. Shaking, with tears streaming down my face, I asked them to please call me an ambulance. I needed help. Instead of this, they pulled my friend out of class to talk me down while I smoked a pack of American Spirits, curled up in the fetal position against a milk-crate out back; rocking myself gently back and forth.\n\nThat should have been the line in the sand, but I was heavily indoctrinated by this point. My parents divorced when I was so young, I had no idea what a functional family unit looked or behaved like. I just assumed they did all of these horrible things because they loved me as some sort of adopted son (a comparison they actively encouraged). I just assumed this was what normal looked like. I stayed with them even after, and likely would still be there making mediocre omelets and paninis were it not for a record-breaking Ice storm. \n\nMy friend had recently moved into the city with his girlfriend, they had an apartment lot all to themselves near Main Street. There was a storm in the forecast, the family had already decided they would be closed the following day. So he invited me to come and see their place downtown, hit up a bar and crash at their apartment. I accepted, and later that evening I found myself sitting in a red-leather booth downing a large amount of Rum, talking to a group of strangers. One of them, it turns out, brewed his own Meade. I thought this was fascinating and asked him to walk me through the process, which he very graciously consented to. In my inebriated and grateful state, I thought it was entirely unfair for me not to return the favor, so I offered him a Biscuit recipe in return. The restaurant\u2019s biscuit recipe. My friend, who was siting at the table with us, said nothing at the time. Later however, he pulled me aside and explained that was entirely unacceptable. It wasn\u2019t my recipe to give out. On this point, of course, he was and remains correct. I will not dispute that fact, nor did I then. I apologized profusely and bought him and his girlfriend breakfast the next day, as an apology. We spent most of *that* day together as well, exploring the city and enjoying each other\u2019s company. \n\nWhen I next went into work, I noticed we had an extra hand on deck. Odd, but not without precedent. They liked to recruit local high-school kids into the \u201cfamily\u201d. I thought little of it. Took a brief inventory, made a plan for prep that day, and asked my boss what she\u2019d like for me to start on. She only said a few words to me, saying I could relax and get some coffee for the moment. It was the last thing she ever said to me. Her husband did the actual firing. He didn\u2019t mince words. I wasn\u2019t welcome there any longer. Please leave, and don\u2019t come back. My friend, facing away and sweeping the hallway, said nothing. \n\nThe only parallel in my life, to being cast out of their lives, is being woken by my mother to say goodbye before she left me and my little sister when we were children. Watching her drive away in the early morning light on a crisp Spring day, just as the birds began to sing, I was filled with an unimaginable grief. My throat swelled shut, and a great weight set itself deep within my chest. A lethargic, hopeless shuffle back into a house with a grandmother that wanted nothing to do with me, a father that was being kept from me (despite his best efforts), and a mom that didn\u2019t think I was worth the effort to stay around for. \n\nBut, that had been nearly a decade ago at this point. I knew the shape and weight of it, the all too familiar sense of impotent devastation. It had beaten me, when I was still a child. That would not happen again. I got another job, in another restaurant. I was a Darden Wage-Slave, microwaving bags of macaroni and breading butterfly shrimp on the fly. But I never resigned myself to it. I worked my ass off, injured myself countless different ways and paid it no mind. I worked every holiday. I cleared the dish pot in between bumps. I broke down the coolers, deep-cleaned them, and put them back together. I hauled hundreds upon *hundreds* of pounds of fry oil out of the building. I descended upon smart-nothing and lazy servers like a fucking grizzly bear, once pinning one up against the wall by his collar. I made a name for myself as the only white guy that could hack it on that line. In my free time I studied and practiced. I would get off of twelve hour shifts, waking home at one in the morning, and *cook* something just so I hated myself a little less. \n\nAnd then, earlier this year, I made the jump to fine dining. Looking around at my peers, I see all the same characters the worked the line at Gusteau\u2019s. There is the same commitment and adoration for the craft; and the same military-esque chain of command in place. I love it. I go home most nights still thinking about my work, about potential improvements on my technique. On stupid mistakes I made that I\u2019ll mentally berate myself for. On the myriad of different flavor combinations, plating aesthetics, and potential specials to plow through the Burrata cheese our distributor didn\u2019t deliver until three days to it\u2019s expiration date.
