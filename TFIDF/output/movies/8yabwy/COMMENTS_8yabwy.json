In all the films.\n\nThe clothing is described as being more modern in the books. Elements of modern clothing are being described as being worn with Wizarding elements. Dresses, trench-coats, vests, jackets, trousers and jeans, boots, heels, sneakers, hoodies, suits, bowlers, fedoras, trilby\u2019s, sweaters, etc, are all described in the series. \n\nIt\u2019s mentioned and stated that the older and more \u201cpure-blood\u201d the Wizarding community gets, the more aristocratic they dress, and the more they wear \u201ctraditional robes\u201d. But robes were pretty much taken as an average term for any type of Wizarding clothing in the book, including dresses, as well as any otherwise normal piece of clothing with added length. \n\nNo, wizards and witches don\u2019t \u201cdress crazy\u201d, and your chastising of the characters as dressing like J Crew models illustrates the issue with your misguided complaints: where does personality and style come in? Fashion is not a monolith, it\u2019s complex, and the Wizarding World is not a vacuum of culture. It\u2019s affected by trends in the non-magical community. In a community greatly affected by the non-magical one, there would be cultural overlap. And even aside from that, not everyone dresses the same. Why can\u2019t we have some people look stylish? Not every character needs to look overly-dressed and cartoonish and silly. \n\nWizards and witches were described as wearing clothing that was \u201cartfully ripped and torn, form fitting, faded\u201d and the like. Leather, tweed, tartan, flannel, etc, was mentioned. \n\nIt was mentioned a number of times that certain, more elderly wizards and witches at the time in Great Britain who tried to dress like non-magical people would end up being inept at modern dressing customs. \n\nThey AREN\u2019T isolated from non-magical beings at all. They share huge population centers with them, and see them every day. \n\nThe series is not there to describe the nuances of Wizarding fashion and how it looks, but judging from the occasional descriptions we do get of it in the series, it certainly isn\u2019t made out to be some medieval wacko-land where all semblance of normal fashion is thrown out the window. \n\nSome people overly-fetishize the whimsical elements of the series that really aren\u2019t significant in the long run. The series has tangibility and grit to it where other fantasy stories don\u2019t. \n\nFurthermore, if you look at the background actors in the Ministry, in Diagon Alley throughout the films, at Hogwarts, in Hogsmeade, etc, you\u2019ll notice that most of the extras are wearing some type of \u201crobe-ish\u201d clothing, some with full witches hat and cloak regalia. But not everyone dresses like that, and still there are just as many extras who wear modern clothing like jackets, skirts, hoodies, suits, trench-coats, vests, and dresses. \n\nEven if you want to argue there\u2019s been a significant stylistic change (which there hasn\u2019t been) I think it\u2019s a far more evocative and original choice to style Wizarding fashion around the period it\u2019s set in. Colleen Atwood talked about flapper dresses with an added sparkle, leather trench coats, and coats embroidered with bird emblems, cloche/witches hats, International Wizarding apparel, and clothing of the period given added length or severity to appear more magical and \u201cout there\u201d.\n\nThat\u2019s much more original than pulling a Star Wars or a Lord of the Rings, neither of which this series is like, setting or design wise.

Wizarding children do wear muggle clothing at some points (lounging around at home, traveling through London to get on the Hogwarts Express, etc), but it's quite canon that during more official/formal wizarding situations the proper attire is robes.\n\nAnd I don't get how muggle clothing make characters feel more grounded. I just watched Lady Bird and Ronan is wearing ridiculous clothing throughout the movie, and I felt she was one of the most \"grounded\" and \"realistic\" characters in cinema this year. Were you laughing in the \"serious\" moments of the later films when Dumbledore was wearing robes? Snape? McGonagall? Were you laughing when Harry was facing Quirrell or the Basilisk whilst wearing robes? Because if you were, then maybe you just have a weird comedy-trigger with robes lol.\n\nUltimately these are wizards, not muggles, and I'm not a huge canon-stan and demand that everything in the movies fits the books, but I do think this is a big one, and is representative on the later directors muting the magical elements of the movie to become more \"relatable\", whatever that means.

They exerted unillateral control ovet the muggle qord amd only went into hiding because it was inconvenient dealing with muggles who were treated as nuisances. Having wizard only spaces was less about hiding from muggles to avoid war and more about not seeing the point in having to deal with the annoying little fucks anymore. \n\n\n Voldemort wanted to replace the segregation based status quo and create an apartheid system for muggles and essentially enslave them while simultaneously committing genocide similarly to what had been gone to goblins, centaurs, house elves, and giants. The point of contention was never whether or not wizards were the superior beings, but how one should treat those beneath them. The bad wizards are the ones who felt that they should show active cruelty and violence towards their lessers. I can do whatever i wakt to anybody I want because who the fuck is gonna stop me. The good wizards don't respect or take muggles any more seriously,but they just feel violence and cruelty for the fun of doing evil deeds is reprehensible. \n\nA big theme in the book is Harry&co growing up and realizing the things that have been accepted as the status quo without a second thought are actually just as cruel and evil. We empathize with the muggles and mugglebormd because they're like us,but over time we realize that the magical \"creatures\" different from us also deserve decency and rights. That even the good guys are actually bigots capable of incredible cruelty. Emphasizing that racism isn't about being a good or bad person: it's a result of education and cultural norms. \n\nIt's well established that muggles are never at any point considered a threat by wizards and that wizards could take over pretty fucking easily if they ever wanted to. They don't because they don't give enough of a fuck about muggles to bother. It's only when you get a handful of oddballs with a vendetta that it becomes an issue. And these oddballs are pretty much universally motivated by their experiences with muggles abusing *children*. There's this question ahout whether a group of people who clearly have no trouble committing atrocities when they have dominance deserve sympathy when a stronger and more capable prey comes along. \n\nMuggles are actually largely depicted really negatively. The only time muggles are depicted positively it's in character who are hardly depicted at all: Hermione's parents, andromedas husband.....pretty much it. Snapes father is depicted as abusive. The dursleys are depicted as abusive. Dumbledore's sister is so viciously attacked that she develops severe developmental problems. Voldemort is shown as being neglected even as an infant. It's actually pointed out a few times that Vernon Dursley is just basically opposite land pureblood bigot.\n\nYou don't sink down to their level. When they go low, we should aim to go high. Thats just reiterated a lot. The fact muggles are shitty and may objectively even 'deserve' a commupance does not forgive your actions when you sink to their level. Muggles could kill completely untrained wizards maybe. But even as young as 13 that basically flips and wizards are already way more capable than most muggles. There's no world in which muggles stand a chance. By the time muggles got their bearings enough to make an attemp, the wizards are gonna swoop in and obliviate and confundus whoever needs to be taken care of.
