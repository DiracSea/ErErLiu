Hope to god people start to appreciate Shyamalan again. \n\nM Night gets more undeserved hate than any director because we want to know what to expect from our directors, and from him, we've come to expect twists and surprises- mostly because of one phenomenal movie and him trying to partially replicate that. \n\nBut that's not what makes him great. What makes an M. Night movie isn't the twist, it's the subtext. A lot of movies have a loose kind of subtext- a collection of metaphors that try to carry meaning and enrich the storyline and how the characters are feeling, etc.\n\nShyamalan movies don't have a subtext hidden below the main plot. They *live* in their subtext and have a plot grown over that- **it's half the goddamn movie and nobody ever pays attention to it because they're looking for the big reveal**. \n\nIt's why, when they work, his movies just leave you feeling wrung out and exhausted- everything you see is colored by that subtext. People and their motivations can be so fucking rich in a Shyamalan movie that you barely understand it. Here's what I mean:\n\nSixth Sense is about a kid who sees ghosts, and it's also about a kid figuring out how to make a place in a world without his father. Dad's recent death or sudden disappearance is NEVER mentioned in the movie, but it's obvious that it happened... kid goes around with dad's old watch for god's sake. The fact that it is completely ignored by the kid and his mom tells us more than them talking about it ever could- it is fresh and a source of real, constant, intolerable pain for them. They're in some kind of shared pathological denial about it. \n\nThat's why they always seem at the verge of tears- because they really are barely keeping it together. Dad is gone and their world has been destroyed. \n\nThe boy's learning to deal with it is told in reflections- mostly how he relates with his \"therapist\", who is both a surrogate father who can never replace his real dad, [and a literal ghost who can never be a real person, even though for a while... boy it really seems like it](#spoiler).  It's also told in how he reacts to friends, his teacher, and the challenges in his normal life. \n\nIn the end, when he tells his mother. He's telling his mother he sees ghosts, but he's also confessing something much deeper- he's opening up about something the two of them have been suffering in silent denial  about- everywhere he looks he sees someone that should be there but is not. \n\nWhy does the mom just break down and cry right away in that scene? She's right there with him- she's dealing with the same thing. \n\nI swear to god, ALL Shyamalan's movies are like this...pay attention and there's something more in all of them.
