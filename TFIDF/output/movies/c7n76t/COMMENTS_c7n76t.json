A Vantage would have a front chin spoiler and blanked off grill.\n\nOf course, it may be upgraded to a Prince of Wales spec car, which means it's got the Vantage engine but not the bodywork. Or it may even have stuff under the bonnet that surpasses the Vantage, like the seven litre conversion. Or... it could even be an electric conversion, which Aston now offer, instead of building replacement engines for the older cars. Anyway, it's not an original Vantage. \n\nThe original Living Daylights car was actually about three different cars, and some scale models. The first one you see is a convertible, which was the personal car of the chairman of Aston at the time. This car *was* a Vantage Volante - a convertible with the performance enhancements but not the bodywork, which later went on to be called 'Prince of Wales spec' as that's how he ordered his car, and a few other people decided they wanted theirs like that too. But the first one was the convertible Aston you see Dalton drive in the early scenes of the film. \n\nBut then you see it get 'winterised' in Q's workshop. But that's so they could use different cars instead. \n\nThese *weren't* Vantages, as they'd bought a couple of tatty older V8s in various states of repair, which were the least expensive model available at the time, to use them as stunt cars for the chase scene. \n\nThey couldn't risk the super-expensive, one-of-a-kind-at-the-time, personal car of Aston's chairman. They also didn't source Volantes ('Volante' denotes convertible Astons, usually) so they included the scene about 'winterising' it where you could see a roof being lowered on, so that they could get away with using the 'cheaper' Astons that they could risk in filming the action stuff.\n\nThe car in this image is probably one of those original V8s. I think I remember seeing one of them on sale a few years ago, with the original numberplate, so that's either been borrowed or bought specifically for this film.", "created_utc": 1561969451.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1561969680.0, "id": "esgvre4", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_c7n76t", "parent_id": "t1_esgekdv", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/c7n76t/first_official_image_from_bond_25/esgvre4/", "score": 14, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "JackXDark", "author_id": "9ibo8", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Hey, that's not just the V8 Vantage, which was also featured in 'The Living Daylights' it's also the car **you** could be driving *today* for the low, low payment of this very large number...\n\n^(terms and conditions may apply)", "created_utc": 1561954132.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "esgim6o", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_c7n76t", "parent_id": "t1_esgekdv", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/c7n76t/first_official_image_from_bond_25/esgim6o/", "score": 26, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "this_anon", "author_id": "yuf48", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "AKA the Aston Martin V8 Mustang", "created_utc": 1561954895.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "esgjhcq", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_c7n76t", "parent_id": "t1_esgekdv", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/c7n76t/first_official_image_from_bond_25/esgjhcq/", "score": 11, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "rockinadios", "author_id": "6dpee", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "After the DB5, I always thought Dalton's AM was the next best looking one.", "created_utc": 1561954750.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "esgjbic", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_c7n76t", "parent_id": "t1_esgekdv", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/c7n76t/first_official_image_from_bond_25/esgjbic/", "score": 6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "hazbutler", "author_id": "hubfg", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Missed Sony alllll over the Craig ones", "created_utc": 1561956010.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "esgkpm6", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_c7n76t", "parent_id": "t1_esghmss", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/c7n76t/first_official_image_from_bond_25/esgkpm6/", "score": 46, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "LuckyDesperado7", "author_id": "jzek3", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I feel like listing Pan Am is kinda unfair, since they were such an iconic part of that era - like, if you wanted to make it obvious that a new film like that was set in the 60s or 70s then you'd have Pan Am everywhere.", "created_utc": 1561960487.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "esgp1cz", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_c7n76t", "parent_id": "t1_esghmss", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/c7n76t/first_official_image_from_bond_25/esgp1cz/", "score": 21, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "TeHokioi", "author_id": "7kzbp", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I wonder how much of the brand of Gun is from brands lobbying vs. The production team choosing one.
