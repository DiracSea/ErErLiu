France is expected to hold out for months again German invasion but Hitler is celebrating in Paris in 6 weeks. BEF are caught totally flat footed and look like they're going to be wiped out unless they fall back. \n\nMassive evacuation from Dunkirk.

In PotC3s scene, where the main antagonists and protagonists face off, he paid tribute to Ennio Moriccone and made his version of the \"Harmonica\". It worked well perfectly. The main criticism people mention is Zimmer's simplicity. But if he can evoke the same range of emotions with 2 notes instead of 20, i am ok with that. And it's not that easy to define a character with just one note like in case with Joker. The truth is, there are no right or wrong ways to write a soundtrack.
