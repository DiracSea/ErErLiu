Would they ever just pull the movie themselves?\n\n>BEL BRUNO: That's the question that we're asking. The belief is no - that what they're trying to do - at least the tactic that our sources are telling us is you kind of put it on the theater owners. That way Sony doesn't have to make that decision, the theater owners do. **And theater owners are privately telling us that they're angry at Sony for putting them in that position. There's no contract between theater owners and Sony, so there couldn't be any lawsuits from that.**\n\nI think that line is the most important there. Sony first put the theatres in a position where they have to decide themselves if they want to pull the movie or not. Then when the Theatres chose to, Sony said, we will pull the movie. This was a calculated move to preserve Sony itself, they werent backed into anything in my opinion. Sony could have easily said, we will show the movie and the theatres would have backed them, instead Sony chose to preserve their bottom line on that chance that if they didnt move first and see what Theatres would do first, there was a chance the movie could still be shown.\n\nIts classic game theory here, theres no advantage to first mover in this game and Sony knew that very well.
