Assuming for what ever reason we decided that we'd want to digitize this entire roll of 70mm film that's 18000x12500 pixels per frame. Most film archival experts advocate scanning at higher resolution than the information content in the film and scale down the scan later in the workflow, but let's just say we decide to scan it in 18K. We choose to digitize it with a 48-bit color depth to allow for more legroom should we want to ajust the colors later on. So there is 16-bits of data for each R, G, and B channel, 48-bits of data per pixel. Without compression, that results in 10800000000 bits per frame, which equals 1.35 gigabytes per frame. This movie being a 70mm IMAX film, it has 24 frames per second. So one second = 1.35 gigabytesx24 = 32,4 GB/second. The IMAX version is 165 minutes, which equals to 9900 seconds. 9900 secondsx32,4 GB/second = 320760 GB for the entire movie, or **320.76 terabytes**.\n\nNot too bad.

Your computer would most likely idle during the entire download process. Modern desktop computers idle at less than 100W, usually somewhere around 50W. No PSU is 100% efficient, so the draw from the wall is roughly 10% more than the internal draw. So if you're using around 50W, the draw from the wall will be slightly more. So then you can divide your cost by at least 10 to get the real figure.\n\nWe must also assume that the average internet speed will increase in the following years. It's likely a very long time until 18K movies are available for download. Let's assume it's 20 years or so until this becomes a reality. I couldn't find any good data on average US connection speed over a long time interval, but let's be optimistic and assume it doubles every 5 years. Then we will all be sitting with 502,4 Mb/s (down speed) internet connections in the year 2034. With this speed, the download time is only **59 days**. Now obviously we wouldn't download this movie in a raw format, right? We'd be downloading it in a compressed format like the movies found on TPB or similar.\n\nAccording to the [H.264 Primer](http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/video/articles/h264_primer/h264_primer.pdf), there is a formula to compute the \"ideal\" output file bitrate based on the video's characteristics. The formula is as follows:\n\n[image width] x [image height] x [framerate] x [motion rank] x 0.07 = [desired bitrate]\n\nWhere\n\n*The image width and height is expressed in pixels.\nThe motion rank is an integer between 1-4, 1 indicating low motion, 2 indicating medium motion, and 4 indicating high motion, where motion is the amount of image data that is changing between frames\n\nWe'll assume a motion rank of 3 for this movie.\n\n18000x12500 pixels x 24 x 3 x 0.07 = 1134000000 bps =  1134 Mbps = 141.75 MBps = 0.14175 gBps.\n\nCompared to 32,4 gBps of the uncompressed movie, x264 reduce the size of the raw data **228 times**. That means the x264 compressed movie will \"only\" be 1403,325 GB, or 1.4TB. With our 2034 502,4 Mb/s internet speeds, we will download files at a rate of 62.8125 MBps. That means:\n\n1mB=0,0159203980099502s\n1400000mB = 0,0159203980099502s*1400000mB = 22288,55721393028s = 371,5 minutes = 6,19 Hours.\n\n-But wait! There is more. \n\nx264 is roughly 10 years old. x265 is on the horizon, and will in the coming years replace x264 on both 4K blu-rays, internet movie streaming, and movie rips like those we find on torrent sites today. x265 roughly doubles the encoding efficiency over x264. If we assume that this trend continue, that there will be a similar replacement of x265 in ten years time with 2x the performance, then we can expect the 2034 rip encoded in \"x266\" to be 1/4 the size of a similar x264 rip.

On slow days we would run the building on 2 people. I would handle projection and sell tickets and a concessionist would handle the rest. That would be for the first 2 shows, and then the projectionist would come in for the evening, and leave everything threaded for the next day.\n\nLater, went to work for a smaller theater. Ran the place solo (tickets, projection and concession) for the first shows on slow days. Did all the breakdowns as well. Occasionally had to go downtown to pick up films from the depot on Friday afternoon and put them together because the film had just been returned from the previous theater.... or worse, driving to the other theater to pick up the print just so we could have it Thursday night to avoid a rush to put them together. Bro-in-law would drive, then we'd go back and put the film together and then off to Waffle House.\n\nSome fun moments:\n\nGetting to the theater with the print only minutes before showtime, praying the whole time that the reels were heads-up, and some jerk didn't put them in the can tails-up. Loading the first reel on the projector and starting it to give me time to assemble the rest of the reels as fast as possible on the platter. Then, as the projector was just about to finish the first reel, yank off maybe 20 feet of film, splice it onto the rest of the movie that is sitting on the platter, and keep going without stopping the projector. If you haven't done a splice on a running movie, you haven't lived! Probably only had to do that twice, but I still feel like a Ninja.\n\nMore Fun: Sometimes the takeup platter might get stuck, and you had the projector on unattended start. You come back into the booth at the end of the movie, and the whole film is sitting on the floor below the projector. Pull the whole movie off the floor in 20 minutes without tangling... rethread and start the movie without being late.\n\nYet more fun: Thread the same film through THREE projectors for the Tuesday kiddy show. We would sell out 3 auditoriums with kids, and only had one print, so the booth was set up to run one print through all three. Had to balance a roller on the film here and there to take up the slack that would build up over 90 minutes. When everything was ready, do a sync-start on all three and pray that everything was set up right. Still amazed that my bro-in-law figured out how to do that.\n\n", "created_utc": 1415237714.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "clu9t99", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_2lectl", "parent_id": "t1_clu28i8", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/2lectl/the_size_of_our_70mm_imax_copy_of_interstellar/clu9t99/", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "JaunLobo", "author_id": "ietzl", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "No one is moving that without a lift, the print alone weighs nearly 800lbs and the magnesium platter is over 100.

H.264 is a compression format, [4k](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution) is a resolution. Resolution is the closest equivalent to film size that we're going to get.\n\nOne of the main problems with traditional film is that it suffers wear and tear. A film one week into its run won't look the same as it did on its first day. You also have to be careful with how you handle it. I once saw a Twilight film **catch on fire** while playing because it got caught on the tray and the projector burned right through it (that was a fun night). For the purpose of this comment however, I'm going to assume that the film is in perfect condition.\n\nRight off the bat, we've got the problem that there is more than one type of film. The two main types are [35 mm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/35_mm_film) (normal cinemas) and [15/70](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/70_mm_film#IMAX_.2815.2F70.29) ([IMAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMAX)).\n\nIMAX film is simply amazing. If you've seen the home media release of [TDKR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Knight_Rises) and compare it to any movie filmed on 35 mm, the difference is **VERY** visible, and that's not even the full IMAX resolution. The cameras are better than 35 mm cameras, and more care is taken all the way through the production line. The problems with IMAX are that the cameras are loud (which is why the dialogue scenes in TDKR aren't filmed in IMAX), the cameras are [gigantic](http://i.imgur.com/ftCGB.jpg), the film is unwieldy for projectionists to handle (as seen above), and it is a lot more expensive to produce all the way through the distribution chain. It is considered to be about equivalent with anywhere from 16k (15360x8640) digital cinema on the high side to [4k](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution)-6k on the low side.\n\nThen we have 35 mm. This is **REALLY** old. It's been around since the 1800s, although what you see now isn't the same thing as what was around then. Most noticeably, the cameras have gotten **MUCH** better. The lenses are larger, the glass used in the lenses are better, etc. It results in more light going through, but those techniques can also be applied to digital cameras. People claim that 35 mm is the equivalent of anywhere from 4k (original master vs. digital) on the high end to about [1267x685](http://www.cst.fr/IMG/pdf/35mm_resolution_english.pdf) on the low end.\n\nWhen it comes to digital, you know what you're getting every time. There's no degradation over time (unless [the HDD fails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive_failure), which usually means that it goes directly from \"full quality\" to [\"doesn't play what was on the failed sector\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_corruption), or the bulb is burnt/burning out), and there's no degradation from the master to what you're watching. On top of that, [the cameras are tiny](http://i.imgur.com/Fa2Gn.jpg), which opens up new avenues for how things can be filmed. There are two types of digital cinema projectors in use right now (2k and 4k), and two more around the corner (8k and 16k). The biggest problem with digital, is that it improves too quickly. Movie theatres don't want to replace their projectors every 5 years, they want to replace them every 50. And that is why there are [phones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_J_Butterfly) coming out that are almost the same resolution [as some cinema projectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_cinema) (1920x1080 vs. 2048x1080 AKA 2K digital cinema). Not to worry though, [8K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8K_UHDTV) is expected to be in North American homes by 2015-2020, events are already being filmed in UHDTV, we've already got [2560x1600 tablets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_10) available for $400, and some 2560x1440 monitors are below $300. If movie theatres want to remain relevant, they'll come around, upgrade to 8k and 16k, and upgrade their sound systems as well.\n\n* **Now, onto frame rate.**\n\nI know you didn't ask this, but it's one of the big differences between traditional film and digital cinema. With traditional film, doubling the frame rate physically doubles the size. With digital cinema, doubling the frame rate doubles the storage media needed (if no compression is used), however the physical size of the storage media will stay the same (they might have to grab a more expensive storage device though).\n\nMost movies are filmed at 24 Hz (23.976 to be precise). That means that each eye sees 24 different frames per second (which in the case of a 2D movie means 24 frames per second). In order to increase the number of frames shown, the reel has to move at a faster speed, and there has to be more film available per second. In order to show a film at 48 Hz, 48 frames per second need to be displayed, resulting in a doubling in costs and print size. In order to show a 3D film at 48 Hz like the Hobbit, the film would have to show **96 FRAMES PER SECOND** (48 per eye per second), resulting in a quadrupling in costs and print size. That's just not reasonable for film. You'd be looking at prints even larger than above, especially if things move up to 120 Hz like they are with gaming and [television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-high-definition_television).\n\nUnfortunately, 24 Hz, while enough for the image to seem continuous, is not enough for a perfectly fluid image. That's why everything seems to jerky any time the camera moves. It is commonly accepted that [at least 75 Hz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flicker_fusion_threshold#Display_refresh_rate) would be needed for a perfectly fluid image, although there is evidence that it would need to be even higher than that. Thankfully, digital projection can handle this (and more) without too many changes to the existing technology. I wouldn't be surprised if we saw a 120 Hz 3D movie (240 frames per second) in theatres some time in the next decade.", "created_utc": 1415237339.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1415237588.0, "id": "clu9mf8", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_2lectl", "parent_id": "t1_clu4rif", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/2lectl/the_size_of_our_70mm_imax_copy_of_interstellar/clu9mf8/", "score": 9, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Charwinger21", "author_id": "4mvt4", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "http://www.imax.com/community/blog/advance-tickets-for-interstellar-on-sale-now/\n\nEdit: I, uh, kinda can't believe I got gold for this.

While the base film is the same, the gates used for the image and the orientation in which the film is ran differ.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/70_mm_film#Technical_specifications", "created_utc": 1415239827.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "cluavi6", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_2lectl", "parent_id": "t1_clu9ds2", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/2lectl/the_size_of_our_70mm_imax_copy_of_interstellar/cluavi6/", "score": 8, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "i960", "author_id": "ix3tw", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Regular 70mm uses a vertical pull down, while IMAX uses horizontal.
