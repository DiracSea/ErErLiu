You want your investment to allow you to make other investments. Usually, the rule is an added 50% of the budget is given for marketing these big movies.\n\nBlomkamp also made District 9 for $30 million and had a $210 million dollar haul. If it add $15 million for the marketing then you have a $165 million dollar positive. Which means it made 4.6x more than it cost to make. Elysium brought in $286. Cost $115 + $57.5 for marketing. Which means it made 1.65x than it cost to make. Chappie brought in $102 million. Cost $49 million + $24.5 for marketing. Which means it made 1.38x than it cost to make. He has been doing some interesting stuff which short films but studios aren't as willing to give him loads of money anymore. He's on a down tick.\n\nI bring up Neil Blomkamp because while Jordan Peele is a much better writer (just won an Oscar for it), and also just made his directorial debut to a smash success, studios will only back him if he can make money for them. I just realized M. Night Shyamalan would've been a better example for this. If Peele starts down ticking then so will his opportunity for big budgets and financing.\n\nTL;DR The Oscar and the success of Get Out will allow him to make films for a while but if they suck, studios won't keep uping their budgets.\n\nEdit: Grammar.
