The band wanted Freddie's death midway through the movie and then focus on the remaining members**\n\nThis is based on Sacha Baron Cohen's interview with Howard Stern where he said:\n\n>\u201c[After] my first meeting, I should never have carried on because a member of the band \u2014I won\u2019t say who\u2014 said, \u2018This is such a great movie, because such an amazing thing happens in the middle of the movie.\u2019 I go, \u2018What happens in the middle of the movie?\u2019 He goes, \u2018Freddie dies.\u2019 I go, \u2018So you mean it\u2019s a bit like \u2018Pulp Fiction,\u2019 where the end is the middle and the middle is the end? That\u2019s interesting.\u2019 He goes, \u2018No no no.\u2019 So I said, \u2018Wait a minute. What happens in the second half of the movie?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Well, we see how the band carries on from strength to strength.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Listen, not one person is going to see a movie where the lead character dies from AIDS and then you carry on to see [what happens to the band].\u201d - [source](http://www.indiewire.com/2016/03/sacha-baron-cohen-says-david-fincher-eyed-queen-biopic-producers-wanted-freddie-mercury-to-die-mid-movie-263717/)\n\nI'm sorry, but this is bullshit. I'm not calling Sacha Baron Cohen a liar. Maybe there was some misunderstanding of epic proportions, maybe someone didn't get a joke? I don't know but the idea that the 2 remaining active members Brian May and Roger Taylor wanted the movie to be about them is utterly absurd. They are very aware that to the general public Queen was and always will be personified by Freddie. All post-1991 relases feature Freddie alone or the whole band on the cover. The recent documentary \"Queen: Days of Our Lives\" focuses on the years with Freddie and only dedicates a few minutes at the end to the 25 years afterwards. And that was an \"official\" documentary with the band heavily involved.\n\nMore importantly though, even in the very early stages - 3 years before Cohen left the project - the movie was supposed to focus on the years leading up to the Live Aid concert in 1985 - 6 years before Freddie's death. [source](http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-11340336)\n\n\n**2. The band want this to be PG-13**\n\nThis is probably based on the aforemention interview where Cohen said:\n\n>\u201cThere are amazing stories about Freddie Mercury. The guy was wild. He was living an extreme lifestyle [of] debauchery. There are stories of little people with plates of cocaine on their heads walking around a party,\u201d Cohen said, before adding that was exactly the kind of thing the surviving members of Queen didn\u2019t want depicted in their biopic. \u201cIt [becomes] a less interesting movie, but you\u2019ve got to remember that they want to protect their legacy as a band, and they want it to be about Queen. And I fully understand that.\u201d - [source](http://www.indiewire.com/2016/03/sacha-baron-cohen-says-david-fincher-eyed-queen-biopic-producers-wanted-freddie-mercury-to-die-mid-movie-263717/)\n\nYes, there are those stories. And the members of Queen have openly talked about some of the extravagant parties but not so much about the drugs. I've read both the books by Freddie's long-time assistant Peter Freestone and the one by his last partner Jim Hutton. Both mention Freddie's drug use, but they also mention that he took drugs to get high and party. They didn't define him, he wasn't addicted, they weren't integral to anything really. Something way more important to Freddie would be sex, but I have a hard time imagining those who keep bitching about wanting all the heavy partying and drug use to be in the movie also wanting lots of gay sex scenes.\n\nAlso, Brian May has more than once said that you can't quote Freddie without swearing, so I have my doubts about anyone pushing for this movie to be rated PG.\n\n\nI encourage everyone to watch the excellent documentary \"Queen: Days of Our Lives\". You can get an idea of who those 4 guys were/are and will get to hear all the stories from the people who were actually there - and that doesn't mean they always agree about what happened, as you will see.", "created_utc": 1526390553.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dz0i02t", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8jldx4", "parent_id": "t3_8jldx4", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8jldx4/bohemian_rhapsody_official_teaser_trailer/dz0i02t/", "score": 370, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "og_penson", "author_id": "8uiya", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Looks good, but I couldn't stop staring at those teeth.", "created_utc": 1526390045.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dz0hjpu", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8jldx4", "parent_id": "t3_8jldx4", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8jldx4/bohemian_rhapsody_official_teaser_trailer/dz0hjpu/", "score": 90, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "happynobita", "author_id": "3znag", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "If Paul Giamatti isn't in this in some form or fashion, then this isn't a true music movie.", "created_utc": 1526425421.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dz1jssr", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8jldx4", "parent_id": "t3_8jldx4", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8jldx4/bohemian_rhapsody_official_teaser_trailer/dz1jssr/", "score": 8, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "rbarton812", "author_id": "gp4g4", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I like Rami Malek, but I think Sacha Baron Cohen would've fit the look a little better.", "created_utc": 1526390572.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dz0i0pj", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8jldx4", "parent_id": "t3_8jldx4", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8jldx4/bohemian_rhapsody_official_teaser_trailer/dz0i0pj/", "score": 650, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "ThaTzZ_D_JoB", "author_id": "61bkrw0", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Well I'm fucking hyped as well.

It's not even a bit out of proportion.\n\nPeople who were in direct contact with the person (or the person itself) the biopic is based on very often sell their rights at their condition, and that condition is literally 'you can just tell this fact' or 'you cannot even remotely mention this moment' - aka, creative control. Which is pretty much the reason why most biopics suck. For instance, *American Sniper* has a horrible discontinued structure because the protagonist's father didn't want certain things in the movie (which along with the fact Eastwood doesn't do re-writes pretty much effed up the movie). \n\nOn top of that, a lot of important facts in a person's life are strictly private, which means they may not be public and the person/family decides not to share, and certain obvious changes that happened in a person life are either made up or just ignored, resulting in a poor narrative. \n\nIn other cases, they result sugar coded, like *Straight Outta Compton* (which might not be extremely sugar coded, but removed a lot of shit to make the characters look better). \n\nIn most cases, though, they are just not memorable if not for things unrelated to the story like the performances. Coincidentally, this biopic is written by the guy who wrote *Darkest Hour* and *The Theory of Everything* (both very safe in portraying the characters), and also wrote the upcoming *The Pope* (which I guess will be about the decision and consequence of disowning the papacy by Pope Benedict - at least according to the few data on IMDb). \n\n> I have my doubts about anyone pushing for this movie to be rated PG.\n\nIt's a Freddy Mercury movie titled after arguably the most popular song of all time, and it's easily marketable. I easily see why they want a PG-13 with an unrated version released in Home Video. \n\nIn addition, *Darkest Hour* and *The Theory of Everything* were PG-13 too. \n\nI undeniably see your point of view, but being business oriented doesn't mean they know better than Sacha Baron Cohen about movies (and I guarantee you they don't), nor the grasp on the audience helps much when deciding what to do. Remember: they continue to do concerts after Freddy died, so I see as a real possibility they might have thought the audience was interested in their lives too. \n\nI honestly have no hopes for this film, and not because of what Cohen told us. It won't tell us anything we didn't know already and it will be all about Rami Malek's performance (which doesn't convince me so far). I don't think it will be good, but we'll see.\n\n\n", "created_utc": 1526407275.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dz107si", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8jldx4", "parent_id": "t1_dz0i02t", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8jldx4/bohemian_rhapsody_official_teaser_trailer/dz107si/", "score": 20, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "LukeRipa", "author_id": "norov", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I mean you are basically calling Cohen a liar on little more than your own feeling.

How're you? :)\n\nSo I'm sure you read the reasons that Sacha Baron Cohen left the movie, and I definitely agree with you that the idea this movie will downplay Freddie's contraction of AIDS is troubling, but here's what I can see from a few watches of the trailer:\n\nThe movie's going start at least from around 1969-70. There's a clip of a young Freddie approaching Brian and Roger whilst they're still in Queen's precursor band, Smile.\n\nThere's plenty of shots of Mary Austin, Freddie's lifelong friend and early partner. This is important, because it was Mary who suggested that Freddie might be gay when Freddie couldn't perform romantically.\n\nIt's going to portray Freddie's sexual evolution and later romantic life heavily, given that there's plenty of shots of him in private situations and clubs with men. How graphic/deep it will be depends on what sort of rating they want to go for, I suppose.\n\nI haven't been able to pick out any definite clips that seem to be set past the mid 80s, but it's entirely possible that they're leaving those out so they don't give everything away.\n\nI definitely don't think it's going to shy away from Freddie's  romantic life, contraction and death as much as Sacha said, but there does seem to be a lot of screen-time dedicated elsewhere.\n\nTL:DR: I can't say for sure yet, but I don't think it's going to be as saccharin and ignorant as a lot of people fear it will be.", "created_utc": 1526404230.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dz0wpf9", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8jldx4", "parent_id": "t1_dz0vuxu", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8jldx4/bohemian_rhapsody_official_teaser_trailer/dz0wpf9/", "score": 230, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Marmite_Badger", "author_id": "17h7s0", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "it's contagious", "created_utc": 1526397634.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dz0p4ki", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8jldx4", "parent_id": "t1_dz0oytq", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8jldx4/bohemian_rhapsody_official_teaser_trailer/dz0p4ki/", "score": 280, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "rubermnkey", "author_id": "bjrez", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Albert Einstein ", "created_utc": 1526398032.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dz0pkcw", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8jldx4", "parent_id": "t1_dz0oytq", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8jldx4/bohemian_rhapsody_official_teaser_trailer/dz0pkcw/", "score": 27, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "sillvrdollr", "author_id": "zt6a3", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "She grows naturally too.", "created_utc": 1526400725.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dz0slhf", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8jldx4", "parent_id": "t1_dz0oytq", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8jldx4/bohemian_rhapsody_official_teaser_trailer/dz0slhf/", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "elephantsnecstasy", "author_id": "119err", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "/r/powderedwig mod here:\n\nIt's not a powdered wig.
