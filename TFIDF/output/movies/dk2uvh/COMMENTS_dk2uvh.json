If he had a bit of a chip on his shoulder it was no doubt a reaction and defence mechanism to the world around him. He had to be a bit arrogant to get people to listen. You will find this is the case with a lot of successful media people (not all).\n\nThe other interesting thing I saw in the extras was Lee\u2019s widow describing incidents in different videos that may have been the same incident. In one IIRC it\u2019s Bruce getting challenged on a set. In another it\u2019s on the street. The details are all slightly different but after a few interviews I was left with the impression that she was either describing the same incident unreliable or she was muddling the facts of different incidents. Other contemporaries including I think Jackie Chan also describe a similar incident or incidents.

He was the best martial artist of his time.\n\n\nBruce and I had a bond with the martial arts, and we would get together frequently. We worked out about 10 to 12 times at his place in Los Angeles\u2019 Chinatown and at my place.\n\n\nWhen I went to his place, he showed me what he did, and I showed him what I did. Although he seemed to love the finishing holds of grappling, it just wasn\u2019t commercially attractive at the time. Actually, it was because of my grappling and tumbling background that I was hired to do the television show \u2014 because I could take falls for Bruce.\n\n\nBruce Lee was an entertaining fellow who was very knowledgeable and very good at what he did. People may wonder just how good a martial artist he was. Well, as I said earlier, he was the best of his time. Also, many of his former students are doing very well today. That\u2019s a sign that he was a good martial artist and that he was able to make his students into good martial artists.\n\n\nBruce developed and performed his own style of kung fu, and a lot of the traditional guys didn\u2019t like it because it broke from Chinese tradition. I know what that is like because I had the same trouble when I tried to improve different martial arts by changing things for the better.
