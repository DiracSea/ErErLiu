Even though 5 years ago Netflix thought they could cater to the tail-end audience by racking up subscriptions through niche content, the viewership numbers don't reflect that.\n\nThere's a book on the subject called \"Blockbusters\" that basically explains how the more content choices are available, the more people actually gravitate towards the most popular selections. That's why Netflix paid like $100+ million for the rights to Friends and The Office, and those two are, surprise, the most viewed shows on Netflix. The unfortunate truth is that people spend their time like they spend their money (as they should); if you only have $10/2 hours to spend, you're going to see what everyone else is already talking about.\n\nThat's also why Netflix has been seriously dropping its festival presence. IIRC in 2016, they bought ~8 films at Sundance, like 20 in 2017, but zero in 2018 and only 2 in 2019. They're learning that the tentpole model applies just as much to streaming services as it does to the major studios. And from what I've been hearing, after their share priced took a hit cause they missed their subscription targets for Q2, they're only going to drop the indie stuff even harder. Management is apparently axing anything that doesn't hit a minimum viewership/cost ratio. Amazon was going down the same path, with regards to festival purchases, but had a management change up recently and wants to revisit the strategy.\n\nSo, yeah, unfortunately streaming services aren't going to be the bastion for indie that this sub thinks it is, and 9/10 people responding to you saying they support niche content are going to watch The Office or the next Birdbox tonight.", "created_utc": 1568125191.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "ezt9w8p", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_d1z0yi", "parent_id": "t1_ezrphf0", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/d1z0yi/netflix_amazon_movies_banned_from_toronto_film/ezt9w8p/", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Horsicorn", "author_id": "a6suo", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Here's the problem with Netflix as an Indie film maker; taken from their submissions page.\n\n\"If you have an idea for a show or film, you may be curious how to send it to Netflix.

Sure, some are flubs and some are gold, but Hollywood has the same problem. \n\nI think your point to the exposure of these more niche movies to an audience that appreciates and wants to see them also touches at that center of mass too. Distribution and marketing of movies is disastrously expensive hence why the typical Hollywood studios have been able to maintain such a stranglehold on the industry - they are (were) the only ones with the resources to get those films to market and they want to see profit from that major investment. But now you have Netflix and Amazon and data centers all over the world. Secure shipping of films? Nope, encrypted transmission spreads the film out in hours instead of days or weeks. Massive television and print marketing using a shotgun approach? Nope, a few ad-buys on platforms your target audience is going to (i.e. reddit). The movie screen is now in up to 7 billion homes around the planet, what THEY want to watch, WHEN they want to watch. Because their costs to get those movies out is so much less (and already being paid for so they can show other content anyways), N&A can afford to spread the love to the indie film maker - especially since those films (when successful) tend to have a higher return for their cost too. \n\nPersonally I think all 3 of you are right and this is going to be bad news for the TFF and old school Hollywood while being a huge benefit to the people who actually want to see them.", "created_utc": 1568085231.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "ezs9dyu", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_d1z0yi", "parent_id": "t1_ezs4pgm", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/d1z0yi/netflix_amazon_movies_banned_from_toronto_film/ezs9dyu/", "score": 33, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "TeddyDaBear", "author_id": "8owhw", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Don't know how you can say that because they haven't made a movie you like that they'll never make a movie you like.", "created_utc": 1568083592.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "ezs6gu9", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_d1z0yi", "parent_id": "t1_ezs4pgm", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/d1z0yi/netflix_amazon_movies_banned_from_toronto_film/ezs6gu9/", "score": 13, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "drstu3000", "author_id": "14g40l", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Do you think they'll be better than Paul Blart?

At the time of the Culture stories, there are perhaps a few dozen major space-faring civilisations, hundreds of minor ones, tens of thousands of species who might develop space-travel, and an uncountable number who have been there, done that, and have either gone into locatable but insular retreats to contemplate who-knows-what, or disappeared from the normal universe altogether to cultivate lives even less comprehensible.\n\n> In this era, the Culture is one of the more energetic civilisations, and initially - after its formation, which was not without vicissitudes - by a chance of timing found a relatively quiet galaxy around it, in which there were various other fairly mature civilisations going about their business, traces and relics of the elder cultures scattered about the place, and - due to the fact nobody else had bothered to go wandering on a grand scale for a comparatively long time - lots of interesting 'undiscovered' star systems to explore...", "created_utc": 1568117626.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "ezt0nx8", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_d1z0yi", "parent_id": "t1_ezst8yn", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/d1z0yi/netflix_amazon_movies_banned_from_toronto_film/ezt0nx8/", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "brg9327", "author_id": "hjxb8", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Yeah it gets way better.
