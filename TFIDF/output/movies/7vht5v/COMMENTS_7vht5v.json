If I remember right, it was a pretty slow ramp-up to action/superhero movies turning into big franchises. I remember a lot of criticism at the time that Hollywood was churning out too many sequels, but most studios hadn't turned to full-on franchises yet. But let's not forget the biggest box office movie of 1999 was a huge entry in a franchise: The Phantom Menace.\n\nThe year 2000 brought us the first X-Men movie, which would become a franchise, the 2nd Mission Impossible, and the 3rd Scream. So not a ton. 4 out the top 10 box office movies were a sequel or the first movie in a franchise.\n\nThe year 2001 churned out: the first Harry Potter, the first Lord of the Rings (both we all knew would be multi-film franchises), the first Shrek which would go on to become a franchise, the third Jurassic Park, the first Planet of the Apes remake, the 2nd Mummy movie, the 2nd Rush Hour movie, and the 2nd American Pie movie. This is just looking at the top 30 or so box office movies from the year.  In 2001, 9 out of 10 top box office movies were either the first movie in a franchise, a remake, or a sequel.\\\n\nIt's pretty crazy comparing the top movies from 1999, which had a few sequels, usually to comedies or family movies where the original had done well at the box office vs. 2001, where we saw the beginning of huge movie franchises and the rise of big box-office remakes.", "created_utc": 1517869262.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dtsjdnx", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7vht5v", "parent_id": "t3_7vht5v", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7vht5v/the_year_that_made_the_matrix_office_space_the/dtsjdnx/", "score": 1832, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "allthebacon_and_eggs", "author_id": "i0ah75f", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Come to think of it, it was a very good year.

Projection big screens and Plasmas were only obtainable by the affluent home theater enthusiast. LCD 1080p screens would soon become affordable to the everyday American, taking more and more people out of theaters.\n\nInternet piracy was getting to extremely high levels, nearly every movie was leaked by DVD screener and people now had the TV's to watch them. \n\nTheater viewership declined causing the movie industry to turn to 3D movies as a way of bringing people back to the theater. James Cameron doubled down on this technology when Avatar released in 2009. \n\nThe point is that there are still plenty of original movies, it's easier to make a movie now than ever before.
