His father (played by Big B) is severely disappointed in his son's life choices and enrolls him into a boarding school. Rambo goes reluctantly.... cue sad farewell Bollywood song as his plane takes off. Amitabh maintains a stern face as his son boards the aircraft and looks back one last time. As soon as his son walks in Amitabh breaks down into tears and is comforted by his wife (played by Hema Malini).\n\nAt boarding school John has a hard time fitting in what with PTSD and all. Until he meets Anjali (Sonam Kapoor). She helps him out a lot during classes because she is attracted to him but all Rambo is interested in is war and shit.\n\nNow one thing I forgot to mention is that this boarding school is very close to the Indo Pak border on the Kashmir side and somehow this boarding school happens to be right in the middle of a secret smuggling route that the Pakistani terrorist insurgents are using to infiltrate into India. \n\nDuring the boarding school's annual day there's a big Bollywood number where Anjali finally breaks through John's tough outer facade and he cracks a smile for the first time in a decade. They fall in love.\n\nThat same evening the school's groundskeeper Chotu (Johnny Lever) hears suspicious noises in the copse of trees right behind the school's football (fucking soccer for you Americans) field. He goes to investigate, being the comic relief that he is. He falls upon a group of 10 terrorist insurgents in full tactical gear. He screams like a girl and runs into the school building and alerts everyone. Too late. The insurgents led by Dara (Gulshan Grover) quickly round up all the staff and students into the main hall and hold them hostage and start debating if they should just kill everyone because no one would ever know. The only thing that is stopping them is the fact that it would draw attention to their smuggling route.\n\nIn the meantime, John and Anjali, who were not present in the building and were out having a romantic evening walk (bow chicka wow wow) come back to the school and notice something is wrong. John quickly instructs Anjali that he will draw out the insurgents to the forest as he is an expert in Jungle warfare so she can escort everyone to safety and notify the police.\n\nCue an hour long action sequence, which, if it had been shot at normal speed, would only take about 5 minutes. However since Bollywood movies love to show the same damn stunt from multiple camera angles in super slow motion because it cost a lot of money and they want to make the most of it, you are treated to watching John pull off the same stunt for 10 minutes before he moves on to the next stunt.\n\nHe finally takes out all the insurgents before the police arrive, haul away the bodies and the police commissioner (Paresh Rawal) pats John on the back and says \"well done my son\".\n\nBy this time the story broke out on Indian media and everyone hails the hero John Rambo. Amitabh, who is teary eyed about almost losing his son, flies to the school with Hema in their fucking private chopper and hugs his son and finally tells him he loves him. John introduces Anjali as the girl he met yesterday and who he wants to marry. Amitabh blesses this matchup and John smiles for the second time in a decade. Fade to black.
