Here you see him working on a prototype of his iconic super-suit, which famously blasts red plasma beams from his eyes.\n\n>Not much is yet known about the character in the film, and that\u2019s exactly how director James Wan wants it. \u201cHe\u2019s part mercenary but full-time pirate who in his suit will look like some crazy alien from outer space,\u201d Wan teases.\n\n>Yet Manta is not the main antagonist in the film. That honor goes to King Orm (Patrick Wilson), Aquaman\u2019s (Jason Momoa) ambitious half-brother who governs Atlantis. \u201cBlack Manta is\u00a0a really interesting character who is somehow factored into this story but our main story is about Jason and Patrick,\u201d Wan says. The film also stars Amber Heard as Princess Mera, Nicole Kidman as Queen Atlanna, and Dolph Lundgren as\u00a0King Nereus.\n\n>The reveal comes on the heels of EW\u2019s exclusive report on Tuesday where Warner Bros. and DC executives\u00a0gave their thoughts on\u00a0Aquaman\u00a0after having seen some of the completed footage.\u00a0Aquaman\u00a0is released Dec. 21.\n\nEDIT : \n>The armies of King Orm (Patrick Wilson) and King Nereus (Dolph Lundgren) face off in this exclusive first look at the fantastical underwater world of\u00a0Aquaman\u00a0\u2014 and there\u2019s\u00a0a lot\u00a0going on beneath the surface. First, let\u2019s take an unobstructed look at this new image:\n\n[Here's a first look at Atlantis warriors riding great white sharks](http://imgur.com/gallery/PMckEWf) from [Entertainment Weekly](http://ew.com/movies/2018/06/15/aquaman-atlantis-sharks/amp/?__twitter_impression=true)\n\nEDIT 2 : \n\n[Some new information about Patrick Wilson's character Orm !](http://ew.com/movies/2018/06/15/aquaman-villain-patrick-wilson/)\n>Thanos would give a thumbs up to\u00a0Aquaman\u00a0antagonist King Orm.\n\n>Patrick Wilson, who plays Arthur Curry\u2019s regal Atlantean half-brother in the upcoming DC film, gave EW some intriguing insight on the character.\n\n>\u201cHe\u2019s kind of an eco-warrior,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cHe\u2019s\u00a0got a very clear gripe with the surface world, which has been polluting his oceans for centuries. And that\u2019s something for me \u2014 I\u2019m sure for you too \u2014 that\u2019s very easy to understand. If somebody was just constantly polluting our air and ruining how we lived\u00a0\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n>The motive is a rather topical issue coming on the heels of\u00a0UN chief Ant\u00f3nio Guterres at the G7 summit\u00a0last week warning\u00a0of a \u201cglobal emergency\u201d due to oceanic pollution, noting,\u00a0\u201cUnless we change course, plastic waste could soon outweigh all the fish in the oceans \u2026\u00a0It kills marine life and is doing major harm to communities that depend on fishing and tourism.\u201d\n\n>Well-meaning comic-book movie villains are turning into a trend. Earlier this year\u00a0Black Panther\u00a0antagonist Erik Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan) was sympathetic in his goals to fight racial inequality. Last month, the blockbuster\u00a0Avengers: Infinity War\u00a0had Thanos (Josh Brolin) endeavoring to kill off half the population in the universe due to overpopulation concerns.\n\n>In\u00a0Aquaman, Orm seeks to unite the seven underwater kingdoms to declare war on the surface world (that\u2019s us), an idea that doesn\u2019t sit well with Curry (Jason Momoa).\n\n>Wilson is a frequent collaborator with\u00a0Aquaman\u00a0director James Wan, who he worked with on the\u00a0Insidious\u00a0and\u00a0The Conjuring\u00a0franchises. One interesting thing about his casting is that with\u00a0his blonde Anglo clean-cut features Wilson looks like a traditional Aquaman, while star Momoa resembles the type of actor who typically gets cast as the heavy.\u00a0\n\n>Wan says he tapped Wilson because Orm isn\u2019t an outright villain, he wanted an actor the audience would like \u2014 plus he just loves working with the guy.\n\n>\u201cPatrick is such a talented actor and a chameleon as well, he can disappear into any role,\u201d Wan tells us. \u201cOrm\u2019s got a soft spot for his brother who lives on the surface world and if anything just wants him to rule Atlantis and the world together, but his brother doesn\u2019t see it that way. A lot of the clashes they have stem from their different upbringings. So I didn\u2019t want to cast a typical villain actor.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "created_utc": 1528995416.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1529086506.0, "id": "e0o3ro0", "is_submitter": true, "link_id": "t3_8r3f6s", "parent_id": "t3_8r3f6s", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8r3f6s/aquaman_first_image_of_black_manta/e0o3ro0/", "score": 453, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Yakiiz", "author_id": "ial8hu0", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I wanna see barnacle boy next", "created_utc": 1528996455.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e0o50he", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8r3f6s", "parent_id": "t3_8r3f6s", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8r3f6s/aquaman_first_image_of_black_manta/e0o50he/", "score": 457, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Projekts", "author_id": "cdg0v", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Entertainment Weekly Covers - Aquaman\n\n*[Jason Momoa, Amber Heard, Nicole Kidman](https://i.redd.it/z4kui66bsz311.jpg)*\n\n\n*[Jason Momoa](https://i.imgur.com/Voiuplj.jpg)*\n\nEW Photos\n\n*[Aquaman (Jason Mamoa)](https://i.imgur.com/lnqqAbv.jpg)*\n\n*[Arthur Curry and Mera (Amber Heard)](https://i.imgur.com/mAghFOD.jpg)*\n\n*[Aquaman & King Orm (Patrick Wilson)](https://i.imgur.com/O7eA1Jh.jpg)*\n\n*[Queen Atlanna (Nicole Kidman)](https://i.imgur.com/hejbjQF.jpg)*\n\n*[Vulko (Willem Dafoe), Jason Momoa, Amber Heard with Director James Wan](https://i.imgur.com/Kv2nyf2.jpg)*\n\nSource: [EW](http://ew.com/movies/2018/06/14/ew-aquaman-cover-jason-momoa/?) , [EW New Photos](http://ew.com/movies/aquaman-photos//?)\n\nEdit: Added new photos", "created_utc": 1528996865.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1529003483.0, "id": "e0o5i8a", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8r3f6s", "parent_id": "t3_8r3f6s", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8r3f6s/aquaman_first_image_of_black_manta/e0o5i8a/", "score": 476, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Johnny_W94", "author_id": "b0p25sj", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I'm glad we're getting comic book movies now where they just go ahead and actually make the characters look like they do in the comics.
