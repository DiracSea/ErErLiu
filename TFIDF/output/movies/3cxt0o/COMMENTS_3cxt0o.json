The movie will start with Bruce Wayne in retirement due to the death of Robin at the hands of Joker.  This will also explain Joker being in prison during Suicide Squad.  He will come out of retirement to take on Superman whose image has been (unknown to Bruce) heavily tarnished by Lex Luthor.  Meanwhile, Lex will use Zods body to create Doomeday, who he will present as a non-alien protector of Earth, but really he wants to conquer the planet.  Lex will lose control of Doomeday who will cause more damage than the Zod v Super fight, causing Batman and Supes (and other Superheroes) to team up and beat (though not kill) Doomeday.  This will also restore Supes superhero cred and form \"Dawn of Super Friends in Dark and Serious Toned Pallette\".  I watch too many movies.\n\nEDIT- A bunch of people have commented on my hypothesis that Doomsday will be created from Zod's body.  I only believe this because Zod's body is in the trailer, and it's been announced that Doomsday will be in the film.  No, this isn't related to Doomsday's comic origin, but that origin has completely changed in various versions of the character, and I doubt they'll use his comic origin in the movie (but who knows).  Zod's body likely serves some purpose, but I may be way off on a Zod/Doomsday connection.

Would Argentinians get angry because he spent more time helping Brazilians during a flood? Would Superman be accused of being unable to prioritize correctly because he prevented a plane crash rather than helping with a forest fire? Does he \"let\" a ship full of people in a hurricane die while he's helping at an earthquake elsewhere?\n\nWe're by no means as advanced as we're probably going to be in the future, but near enough that most of our really serious problems are manmade: \n\n - We didn't lose 20,000 people in an earthquake because of the earthquake; we lost 20,000 people because nobody wanted to pay to build to code. \n - City A didn't get flooded because floods happen; it got flooded because nobody wants to pay for flood-control infrastructure and we haven't been that great at addressing climate change. \n - The bus didn't crash because shit happens; it crashed because the driver's working two jobs without benefits to feed his family and is exhausted most of the time. \n - The famine didn't happen because crops failed; it's because warlords or a repressive government don't mind letting inconvenient people starve. \n\nIf humanity actually had access to a living god that spent most of his time saving us, I think we'd be a lot more likely to let him soak the blame for these problems rather than take responsibility for our own greed, lust for power, and short-sightedness. Superman's presence carries the real danger of turning humanity into the equivalent of a child race with a child's tantrums. And not coincidentally, this is a point that Lex Luthor has broadly made in the comics.\n\nJor-El sees humanity's potential. The Kents see what humanity actually *is,* and they're a lot more circumspect about what Clark should be doing with his life. \n\nI kind of love *Man of Steel* for a reason that I found hard to articulate for a while, but I think what it boils down to is this: ***Man of Steel* is a pessimistic movie about hope.**", "created_utc": 1436645894.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1436895499.0, "id": "cszzgy6", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_3cxt0o", "parent_id": "t1_cszxubp", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/3cxt0o/new_trailer_for_batman_v_superman/cszzgy6/", "score": 2816, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Cenodoxus", "author_id": "5ahxa", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "That line was fantastic.
