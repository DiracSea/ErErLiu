Not only that, it was full of factual errors and very out of touch.\n\nBut, I digress. YMS managed to find a \u201cfatal flaw\u201d in the film. Where other reviewers failed to find something \u201cwrong\u201d with the film, YMS (who doesn\u2019t count as a Rotten Tomatoes reviewer, at least not at the time), and people jumped on that bandwagon.\n\nHis entire observation was that the film followed many narrative beats as the 2nd film: Woody Gets Seperated From the Others, Delusional Buzz, Climax on conveyor belts, Villain who is secret evil...etc.\n\nHowever, he didn\u2019t delve any deeper than that. Because apparently if your *sequel* follows any sort of the same plot structure as the previous film, than its automatically the same exact film. Who cares that character motivations and stories are completely different? The plot outlines, when reduced to their most basic layout (minus conveniently left out points to drive the point further) resemble each other, and that makes the film BAD.\n\nIt\u2019s stupid. But, I reckon that there are people who so desperately want to hate Toy Story 3, that they will attach to any and all criticisms, no matter how if they should really be considered criticisms or not. \u201cThere\u2019s some vaguely unoriginal aspects of of Toy Story 3, how dare they?!?\u201d\n\nI personally have a lot of problems with Toy Story 3, and I actually think it\u2019s the worst of the 3 films.\n\nI think if one were to rewatch it as a post-high school/college student, the themes lose a little of their luster, and feel a bit melodramatic.
