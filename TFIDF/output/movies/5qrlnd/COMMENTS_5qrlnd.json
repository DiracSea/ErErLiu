Big corporations.  The studios are big corporations.  Both have ongoing deals with one another, and even before they got hostile to Netflix and the threat streaming represents, they didn't really want to rock the boat.\n\nAnyone who wanted to get into theaters had a pretty steep hill to climb, because it would take billions of dollars to get into the game and secure screens for showings.  Easy reference: the complaining from some filmmakers last year when Disney locked down such a huge number of screens (especially specialty screens like the IMAX venues) for Star Wars VII.\n\nNetflix and Amazon don't need, don't want, the screens.  They have their own distribution channels.  With that, with streaming, they just need funds to produce or purchase content to fill their streams with.  Turns out, even movies are a hell of a lot cheaper than muscling into theatrical showings.  So are even expansive tv series.  It's beyond obvious now that serious quality content is on streaming.  Not joke shows, not trainwrecks; movies and series that people talk about, like, and are hungry for more of.\n\nThe industry's shifting.  Theaters aren't going away.  But every filmmaker, every creator of video content, needs money to fund their projects, and a place to show them.  There are more than a few, good ones, who are willing to write deals with parties like Netflix and Amazon.  So their content can get made and be in front of viewers.\n\nAnd the little stirrings of \"hey this could be a thing\" are past being a serious rolling stone.  With every deal, with every show that hits streams and gets people talking about \"hey, this is good\" it convinces more and more content producers to not dismiss them as a viable option.  A legitimate one.  The Sundance purchases are just the latest example of this.\n\nTimes are changing.  Go Netflix.  Go Amazon.

Netflix is peanuts compared to companies like Amazon, Google, and the incumbent cable companies. Netflix is a single application that runs on a tiny fraction of the computers that Amazon owns, which runs on a tiny part of the network which cable companies own. At the end of the day, everything is possible because of cable and hardware infrastructure!   \n\nComcast + Amazon + Google is a trio that spells out Skynet as close as we can get to today. Compared to that, Netflix is like your aspergers friend that knows everything about movies.
