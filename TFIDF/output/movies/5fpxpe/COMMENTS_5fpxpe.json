The feature is pretty straightforward -- when a show or movie is available to save offline, you'll see a little \"download\" button. Netflix notes that many of its big shows, including Orange is The New Black, Narcos and The Crown, are available to download today. Notably, those are all Netflix original shows -- we're not sure if things from other studios will be made available just yet. And it most definitely seems like the entire catalog will not be made available all at once -- but this is still a pretty big deal considering Netflix consistently rejected this feature in the past.\n\n>Oddly enough, Netflix publicly pondered offline playback pretty recently, but only as a way to make the product more appealing in developing markets where the internet infrastructure doesn't allow for continuous streaming like most of us in the US can experience. But it's probably a good idea not to restrict a feature that so many customers have been asking for for years, and that so many of Netflix's competitors are already offering.\n\n>Update: the iOS app is live, and so we've gotten a chance to see just what's available. Netflix helpfully groups all of the offline content in a tab so you can see exactly what you can download. And it's a mix of originals and content from other sources -- a bunch of NBC shows including Parks and Recreation, The Office and 30 Rock are available, as well as movies incluing Boyhood, Dazed and Confused, Minions and many others. Obviously we haven't had a chance to dig through the catalog too much just yet, but rest assured that there is plenty of high-profile content you can save in offline mode.\n\n>Netflix also says that regardless of what plan you're using, you'll be able to use the download feature -- it's good to see they aren't using this as a way to upsell people to its higher-priced plans. The one catch we've discovered thus far is quality. The default \"standard\" quality mode appears to be a pretty low-resolution mode, and bumping it up to \"higher\" quality still doesn't make video download at the highest resolution available. Streams still definitely look better -- but this will be less of a problem for those watching on a phone.

Their names, and birthdays, and favorite things from years past that you hope are still current enough for a good conversation; those are bright in your mind from years of raising them as best you could, and from keeping them in your thoughts the way you do when you love people that much.

They usually visit on Sundays when they aren't too busy. *Orderly, what day is it?* Wednesday... well, it'll be Sunday before you know it. Maybe this time they'll be able to stop by and say hello.

It doesn't matter if you're a small business operating out of your home or a larger business like Google or Amazon. The idea is to support competition by providing a level playing field for everyone. This idea is known as net neutrality.\n\nHistorically with the creation of the Internet general rules for this net neutrality idea were created and enforced by the FCC, but not officially codified into law. There was a general understanding that functioned well for couple decades that everyone play nice by the net neutrality rules and the FCC wouldn't sharpen the regulatory teeth. No one really knew what the Internet might become or what business models would be successful with it. Soft net neutrality was a good environment to sponsor innovation and for the most part everyone was happy.\n\nOver time traditional cable and phone companies have seen much of their legacy business models eroded by competing services on the Internet. They've heavily moved into the ISP space to supplement these declining revenues, while becoming less happy with the soft net neutrality arrangement. Verizon finally pulled the trigger and sued to have soft net neutrality thrown out. As a result, we had discussion last year that led to hardened net neutrality codified into regulatory law by the FCC. Idea was to restore the system that has worked to grow the Internet for the last couple decades.\n\nThe new net neutrality rules have some shortcomings. The legacy cable and phone industries still aren't happy with the current environment, they want to recreate the type of locked-in control of cable across the entire internet. One of the ways now pursued to do so is to install arbitrary data caps (unlike physical resources data scales well, these limits are completely arbitrary), then allow certain companies not to count against those limits. That way a company like AT&amp;T can create a clone of Netflix, make it not count against data caps, and strip customers from Netflix who are subject to data caps. AT&amp;T can simultaneously demand payouts from Netflix to not count against the data caps, forcing Netflix to pass that cost on to the customers. This idea is 'zero rating', a way of using data caps to hold customers hostage and demand payouts from every other company online to access them. In the end those additional costs all get passed down to the customers subscribed to AT&amp;T. It's a sneaky way for AT&amp;T to double-dip on everything, charge MASSIVE amounts for Internet service hidden across bills from other service, and control which business are winner or losers online. \n\nThis would represent a huge shift of power in the Internet. College students with the next big Google or Reddit ideas would have to come up with additional bankroll to pay off ISPs to access people online through zero rating in order to get their projects off the ground. This is where you see hyperbolic statements such as zero rating breaks the Internet -- it's actually an accurate description. Zero rating breaks the Internet for everyone but those on the payroll or invested in the major telecom companies that control the last mile.", "created_utc": 1480531164.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "damdnuj", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_5fpxpe", "parent_id": "t1_dam5bow", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/5fpxpe/netflix_says_it_is_finally_adding_offline_playback/damdnuj/", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "kerosion", "author_id": "4cq53", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/02/zero-rating-what-it-is-why-you-should-care\n\nLike ATT offering streaming to directtv content on mobile and it doesn't count towards your data limit.
