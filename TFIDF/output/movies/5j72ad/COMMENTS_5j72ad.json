But it was only around 1997, when a new directors cut came out, did a new addition appear in a particular scene.\n\nThis scene involves a sleeping Deckard who then dreams about a unicorn in a forest. This moment was actually a cut scene from Scott's fantasy movie Legend that he inserted to further the narrative that Deckard is a replicant. In a channel 4 interview, when asked what this meant, he whispers \"He's a replicant.\"\n\nNow this is completely at odds with what the screenwriter intended, who is adamant that Scott was retroactively changing the story to make money on director's cuts. He says that the story was never meant to insinuate Deckard being a replicant and that there should be no ambiguity that he's human. And if we look at the book, this too is clear.\n\nIt's hard to take Scott seriously on this. Prometheus shows us he doesn't necessarily have a good grasp on his own past film's mythology and if this new sequel goes further with the replicant idea, I'm not sure that's where it should, since it changes the ambiguity of the original. /Rant\n\nEdit: Just to clarify, I personally feel the replicant idea doesn't really matter because it doesn't change the themes of the movie: fear of death, mortality, what is it to be human. Deckard struggles with this anyways, whether he is human or not. It's a cool idea, I just think it's superfluous.\n\nEdit 2: Actually as someone pointed out, the footage isn't from Legend (which was a popular rumour) but was actually made in the post production of BR, after principal photography. Scott initially felt it wasn't a big problem to remove it since the studio didn't like it. Reading more about it, it seems Scott was adament on making it out that Deckard was a replicant and the original screenwriter (who was against it) was taken off board for a new one to come in and insert these hints.  \n\nHampton Francher (original screenwriter)- During a discussion panel with Ridley Scott for Blade Runner: The Final Cut he cuts Scott off during the replicant talk saying \"Ridley's off, he's totally wrong!\" and that \"[Scott's] idea is too complex\" and prefers the film to remain ambiguous saying \"So the question [is Deckard a replicant] has to be an eternal question. It doesn't have an answer, and what I always say about that is what Pound says: 'Art that remains news is art in which the question 'what does it mean'' has no correct answer. I like asking the question [about Deckard] and I like it to be asked but I think it's nonsense to answer it...that's not interesting to me\"\n\nEdit 3: Soooo I found even more info: \n\nRidley maintains that the unicorn sequence was part of it and was filmed in post production.\n\n But an interview with Peoples, the second screenwriter, maintains that the production of Blade Runner bled into the pre production of Legend and that the unicorn sequence was actually test footage for Legend filmed in pinewood studios. It was repurposed and shelfed until the first alternate cuts came out because the studio hated it.\n\nSome argue that the origami unicorn is proof but remember that that may simply be a reference to rachael \"the rare creature\".\n\n    ", "created_utc": 1482165550.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1482187413.0, "id": "dbdverf", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_5j72ad", "parent_id": "t1_dbduip2", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/5j72ad/blade_runner_2049_announcement/dbdverf/", "score": 262, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "The_Telltale_Fart", "author_id": "ek66h", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "He's clearly aged in this clip.
