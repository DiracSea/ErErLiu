Apparently we weren\u2019t the only ones with the idea to drink during the movie, so basically the entire movie was popping beers and mixing vodka into overpriced sodas. Then, as soon as snakes started showing up, we started throwing our rubber snakes... just as a few other groups of people started throwing their rubber snakes. It was hilarious pandemonium. Snakes everywhere, beers popping, people cheering every time Samuel L Jackson mentioned a snake. To this day, that was one of the most fun theater experiences I\u2019d ever had. My group and another group stuck around after the credits and helped the staff clean up and some of the workers cleaning were part of (which we didn\u2019t know at the time) a group that was also drinking and throwing snakes.
