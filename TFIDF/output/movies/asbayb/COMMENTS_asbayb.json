My friend, being modest, says that they can't take all the credit and it was Bo's recipe to begin with. He calls over Bo and, yeah, it's Bo Burnham. My friend mentions that I love his granola recipe and his face lights up and talks about how he was sick of buying granola that were half sugar. I mentioned that I was also a fan of his work, which he kind of politely shrugged off, then went back to talking about cooking.

Most people don't notice because it's pretty scary, but I'm fairly immune to horror, I'm just not frightened by movies. When you aren't terrified, there are some absolutely ridiculous moments in that movie.\n\nLike what the fuck happened in the bath? How did she not die? It's like the writers decided they wanted that scene, so they wrote it in, and then realised they couldn't write their way out of it, so they just cut away, and the next time you see her she's somehow fine. Were they implying that the kid was the second coming of Jesus or something, because I'm not sure I can justify an entirely silent birth scene any other way.\n\nThe toy at the start? The boy wants it but it makes noise. Clip the fucking wire and give it to him. Would that be so hard?\n\nAnd they spent so long wiring up this light based warning system. As soon as I saw that I thought \"Why the fuck would you use light and not sound?\" Imagine if every one of those lights was an alarm clock. You see a monster, you set the alarms off, you now have about an hour to wander off as the monster runs around destroying all the alarms.\n\nTake that logic one step further. Go to a military base, find yourself some air raid sirens (or just make one, it's just two steel drums with a motor) and then bury them in concrete at 1 mile intervals. Any time a monster comes near you just turn it on for 5 minutes and they sprint for the hills.\n\nAnd the fucking way they kill it. Your telling me NO ONE FIGURED THAT OUT? Humanity was annihilated before anyone decided to try shooting them in the fleshy bits? I mean you could defeat them 1 on 1 with a shotgun with a 100% win rate. Make some noise...wait for them to show up. Throw a stone at it, it's head opens up to hear, stick a shotgun in it's ear.\n\nThere's so little threat if you just make the characters not utterly brain dead. Not to mention the fact that this hearing based predator that's head is entirely ears can't hear breathing in a silent room from a few feet away. HUMANS can fucking hear breathing from the distance it is away in some of the scenes. \n\nThe fact that it could even be considered for an award for writing just goes to show little you should care about award shows.

So even though there is a bunch of noise, in the process you've attracted an entire legion of the things. \n\nAnd with the way they killed it, nobody figured it out because it took them a long time to realize they were attracted to sound. In the meantime, humanity made so much noise there was no way to determine that was what the cause was. Then once the population started to dwindle, they figured it out, but by then their resources and ability to use them was diminished. \n\nAnd the toy at the start, they might not have had wire clippers with them and there was a risk of the toy going off while trying to take the wire out.

Doubled my income, got a work from home position--and I don't even have a degree.  It was like all the stars aligned and immediately I had everything I dreamed of.  I even met my wife a few weeks later.\n\nImmediately I started buying and doing everything I ever wanted.  I bought a cool new car, I got a house, I got married, I bought a new gaming PC.  I traveled the world, went to Greece and Italy and Croatia and Turks and Caicos and the Dominican Republic.  I learned to SCUBA dive and started shooting competitively.  I bought lots of really expensive guns.  But slowly, the more stuff I bought and did and saw, the more I realized it wasn't what would fix me, or make me happy.  I didn't have room for all of it.\n\nThe more things I bought, the more stress I had.  The things that at first brought me great joy seemed almost like burdens.  It was like instead of making me more happy, it made me more nervous--and I don't mean nervous from debt.  I mean it was like the more fun stuff I had access to, the worse I felt about not being happy; like when you click through Netflix for an hour and can't find anything to watch.\n\nBasically, I wouldn't have bought all this stuff if I knew it wouldn't fit.  After six years clean and sober I relapsed, because I found no peace or comfort in places and things, and I ran out of dreams to chase.\n\nI'm doing better now, simplifying my life, selling the things I don't need or use, and focusing on the things that do matter and do bring me joy: my wife, my family, helping others.\n\nThat's how I relate to it, anyways.", "created_utc": 1550605414.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "egto9dz", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_asbayb", "parent_id": "t1_egtfts0", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/asbayb/bo_burnhams_acceptance_speech_after_winning_the/egto9dz/", "score": 31, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "kellenthehun", "author_id": "7l94j", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "That one line \"I try to give you something I cannot give myself\" (paraphrased) is just so hard hitting and really speaks volumes about his self awareness", "created_utc": 1550601815.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "egtiu9s", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_asbayb", "parent_id": "t1_egtg83s", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/asbayb/bo_burnhams_acceptance_speech_after_winning_the/egtiu9s/", "score": 120, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Grimsrasatoas", "author_id": "6s32f", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "\u201cAnd laugh as he tries to give you what he cannot give himself.\u201d That line still gives me chills every time and I\u2019ve probably seen that video upwards of twenty times", "created_utc": 1550602079.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "egtj8yz", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_asbayb", "parent_id": "t1_egtg83s", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/asbayb/bo_burnhams_acceptance_speech_after_winning_the/egtj8yz/", "score": 40, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "wagellanofspain", "author_id": "kki26", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I almost cry at that line every time.

It will protect against arrows because they don't have enough force or material strength to penetrate, and they can also be deflected. Blunt weapons are hard to deflect and have a lot of force for their area. A suit of armor won't protect you against a bullet, because it has even *more* force with a smaller area, and enough material strength to not shatter.\n\nKevlar won't protect you against a knife, because it's not designed to deal with slashing or sustained force piercing.
