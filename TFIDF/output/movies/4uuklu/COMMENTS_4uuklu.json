His name in Lakota translates as Wounded in Winter Beautiful Bald Eagle.\n> \n> Dave was raised in the Minneconjou Sioux tribe, largely by his grandparents, on the prairies in the heart of America. He grew up speaking Lakota and immersed in Sioux tradition. One of his grandfathers was the warrior White Bull, who led the assault on General Custer at the Battle of the Little Bighorn.\n> \n> Inspired by stories of White Bull\u2019s friend Crazy Horse, Dave was keen to make his mark. He won his first rodeo at 14. He underwent the traditional sundance cermemony aged 15, and at 17 joined the Fourth Cavalry where he participated in the last years of mounted cavalry before mechanization, and became a formidable boxer. He re-enlisted into the 82nd Airborne \u2013 the All Americans \u2013 at the outbreak of the Second World War and fought in the landings at Anzio in Italy where he won the silver star. He was severely wounded by German fire while parachuting into France during the Normandy invasion.\n> \n> After convalescence he pursued a musical career as drummer for Cliff Keyes Big Band from Minnesota, then later for a South Dakota western band. This led him into a dance partnership with Penny Rathburn that won them the district ballroom championships. David and Penny were newlywed and she was expecting their baby when she was tragically killed in a car wreck. Suicidal, Dave turned to anything that would kill him: rodeo, skydiving, dirt track car racing and stunt driving. However instead of killing him it made his name, and he established a career in Hollywood. He was in over 40 movies and trained many western actors - including John Wayne - in techniques for horse and gun handling. He served as Errol Flynn\u2019s stunt double and became friends with Marilyn Monroe and many other stars of the time. Acquaintance with leading Hollywood players did not diminish his aversion to studio politics and he eventually left Hollywood to become a Champion Indian Dancer, winning the National Dance Championships in \u201960 and \u201961, and return to a successful career in rodeo.\n> \n> In 1958 he joined Casey Tibbs and a rodeo display team travelling to the World\u2019s Fair in Brussels, Belgium. A chance meeting with a young Belgian girl named Josee Kesterman restored David\u2019s will to live and secured their future together. Josee migrated to the United States and near Cherry Creek they created a home together with their children, a labour of love they both worked hard to establish amidst the privations of reservation life. Dave and Josee\u2019s generosity and kindness to family, friends, and strangers alike is legendary. Together they have influenced innumerable lives for the good.\n> \n> Dave continued to work as an actor and established a successful ranch on the reservation. His knowledge of oral history and traditions taught to him by his grandparents instilled in him a strong sense of responsibility to his people. This dedication led to his appointment as the traditional Chief of the Minneconjou Lakota Oyate in the late 1990s. In 2001 he was elected as the first Chief of the United Native Nations. His work in conflict resolution led him all over the United States.\n> \n> Dave\u2019s final film role is in Neither Wolf Nor Dog which premiered in June at the Edinburgh Film Festival.\n> \n> Although Dave encountered many forms of prejudice and discrimination he never showed bitterness, and met adversity with invincible courage and humour. He somehow seemed to embody what was great about the culture of the American West, as well as his own Lakota spirit. He was extraordinarily funny and no-one who met him could forget his easy laughter. His life and work stand as a beacon to many.\n> \n> Remembering his childhood Dave said: \u201cIt was tougher back then; I\u2019ve had a rough life. But I can remember everything. From horse and cart days right up until today; jet planes and computers. When I was a boy there weren\u2019t even any fences. No electricity lines or phone lines. No roads, nothing. You could just head out across country and you wouldn\u2019t have to open any gates or anything like that. All just open prairie. The world has changed so quickly in just one life time. It\u2019s so short a time. I\u2019ve had a long life but it just seems like yesterday\u201d.\n> \n> David William Bald Eagle / Wounded in Winter Beautiful Bald Eagle born 8th April 1919, died 22nd July 2016. Survived by his wife Josee, and his many children, grand children, great grandchildren and great-great grandchildren.\n", "created_utc": 1469639295.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d5t6vub", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_4uuklu", "parent_id": "t1_d5syzvi", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/4uuklu/native_american_chief_david_bald_eagle_who/d5t6vub/", "score": 78, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "sqweexv", "author_id": "e0iqi", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "He's basically the Native American version of Christopher Lee.

One hell of a life though!\n\nBiography\n\nBorn in a tipi in 1919, Dave Bald Eagle lived with his grandfather, White Feather, and spoke only Lakota until he went to school when he was 12 years old. When World War II broke out, he joined the Army and became a paratrooper with the 82nd Airborne. He and his unit jumped behind the lines at Anzio and fought their way to the beachhead. On D-Day the 82nd Airborne, including Dave, were mistakenly dropped over German lines. \"We were just like clay pigeons, coming down,\" Dave recalls. \"Most of my outfit was wiped out.\" Before he even hit the ground, Bald Eagle was riddled with bullets. He survived but he was so badly shot up that the Army refused to let him re-enlist.\n\nAfterward the war, Dave became a race car driver, played semi-pro baseball in Minneapolis-St. Paul and went into pro rodeo, riding bareback broncs and bulls. Dave also acted in several movies in the 40s and 50s, including \"River of No Return\" with Marilyn Monroe and also with Errol Flynn. He said he and Monroe went out dancing during one break in filming. He traveled to Europe to rodeo with Casey Tibbs' Wild West Show in 1958 and met a young Belgian actress, Josee Kesteman, in Brussels during the world's fair. They married, moved back to the reservation and started raising horses and children. \n\nIn the 90's he was made First Chief of the United Indigenous Nations, a society of chiefs from various reservations. He has ridden in the Days of '76 Parade at Deadwood for more than 70 years and still appears occasionally in films, most recently in \"Into the West\" and \"Imprint.\"", "created_utc": 1469632900.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d5t1m3x", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_4uuklu", "parent_id": "t1_d5sz0v6", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/4uuklu/native_american_chief_david_bald_eagle_who/d5t1m3x/", "score": 64, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Mitsukumi", "author_id": "ac2pn", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "[deleted]", "created_utc": 1469631059.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1470493279.0, "id": "d5t06om", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_4uuklu", "parent_id": "t1_d5sz0v6", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/4uuklu/native_american_chief_david_bald_eagle_who/d5t06om/", "score": 23, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Who was he in dances with wolves?

It's something of a myth that Ellis Island customs officials re-named people out of laziness or difficult pronunciations. There are certainly misspellings, but otherwise, name changes were provided almost always by the immigrant, not the immigration officer. More often, immigrants used their own names when going through Customs, and then American-ized their names afterward.\n\nHowever, you're not wrong, and there are lots of instances of straight up new names. This goes back to at least 1680, when the English government, who had recently taken over New York for good, forced all the Dutch people in the colony to stop using patronymic \"Dutch names\" and use an \"English name\" instead with its fixed surname style.\n\nMany of the Dutch people did so only begrudgingly. But many others refused to comply and the English just chose a last name for them. A forced name change.\n\nSomeone named \"Jan Pietersen van Buren\" would end up as \"John Shoemaker\" because he was a shoemaker and another family had already claimed \"van Buren\". Or they might even end up as \"John Crispin\" because both \"van Buren\" and \"shoemaker\" were taken and St. Crispin is the patron saint of shoemakers. There are a ton of instances like this at the time, many with really obscure origins.\n\nMany of the Dutch people hated this, and continued to use their old names in Dutch Church records for many more decades. But by 1700, most of the holdouts had died out, their children didn't care as much, and by the time of their grandchildren, the issue was forgotten. And so, too, the true origin of their names.\n", "created_utc": 1469647420.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d5tdq7a", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_4uuklu", "parent_id": "t1_d5t4jo8", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/4uuklu/native_american_chief_david_bald_eagle_who/d5tdq7a/", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "lord_mayor_of_reddit", "author_id": "imnl9", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Yep!

Most liberal states and regions would probably be in favor of improvements in Native American relations, but the reality is rather more complicated than that. The main issues are the lack of political power (low voting record, dearth of political research and dat, lack of representation) and the **biggest obstacle**- that  only the federal government has the power to enact anything. State governments have no jurisdiction in this matter, and with many Native Americans reservations located in conservative states, they lack strong political representation at the Congressional level for any consistent support. \n\nThe most viable support could originate from more supportive Senators and Congressmen colleagues, but their districts and states often do not host enough Native Americans voters (or even residents) to matter much. Also, consider the role of big money from gaming, the overshadowing effects from contemporary minority movements from African Americans, and strong and acetic advocacy from racially motivated groups in some part of the countries. Recent legislation and executive actions from the current administration has drastically improved many facets of the political and socioeconomic power of the Native Americas (all easily found data from Google search), but there is still so much more work needed to be done. \n\nI don't want to sound corny, but this is one of those cases of \"bad triumps when good men does nothing\" (not exact quote). Native Americans deserve innumerable changes and improvements for countless reasons, but the more promising changes could only come from more awareness and advocacy from everyone else to reach the difficult obstacle of federal recognition.
