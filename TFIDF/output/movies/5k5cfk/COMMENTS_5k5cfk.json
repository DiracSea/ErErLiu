Them being Arabic is part of the joke for sure, but it's used as the setup for the lengths they'll go to still do cliche \"guy stuff\"  when women are still covered up.\n\nAdditionally, Key and Peele are brown dudes. In terms of \"punching down\" it's kind of a lateral move. We can have a separate discussion about whether it's \"fair\" that minorities can (carefully) make fun of other minorities, but that's pretty much how it goes.
