But I'm not really sure how interesting a movie that'd be.\n\nI guess if I were going to do it, I'd have one of the kids from Road Warrior, maybe 5 years later when they're a teen try and track down Max. Probably because he's a legend to them and their community is in trouble again. The kid remembers how Max helped save them before and thinks he can recruit Max to help them again. In tracking him, he'd go through the remains of Thunder Dome and the aircraft kids, through Fury Road, and any other adventures you wanted to have had Max go on.\n\nI think in meeting the other people, and seeing how they've also lionized Max but also learning some real truths in it he might come to see Max was never a hero there to save people, he was a capable man who was trying to survive and some people just benefited from that. In tracking Max's path he of course would come to meet new villains that filled the power vacuum that Max left behind him, and thus develop into a fighter himself.\n\nI think the fitting, if not acceptable by today's standard, is that he would never find Max. Instead that Max wasn't endowed with super powers as people like to talk about him, but that he himself could do anything that Max could do. He would head back to his village knowing that he had the power to fulfill the role that Max fulfilled years ago. But when he gets back he finds the village to already be under heavy attack, he joins the fray, but finds the forces he thought (the reason he was originally sent out to find max) he'd be fighting were just an advanced party setting things up, he's fighting a much larger force now. The small group should fight well and with ingenuity. But he should lose his family in the fight, and should be wounded badly by main antagonist in the final show down. He can best and kill the antagonist, but he's lost everything of meaning to him.\n\nActually you know let's make the protagonist a teenage girl. She's sent out in the dead of night on a motorcycle to rush past the patrolling enemies in a harrowing run. We're past the point where guns are common so she's equipped with machete like swords. She's out here partly because she looks up to max and partly because it's what the town wants. But one of the elders, one who actually fought with max, pulls her aside and gives her a small sack of valuables saying \"he might not be as noble as people remember... if he doesn't accept this you may have to offer yourself as well\". Her job in the community would have been a forward scout so she's good for this role. In her path she refines the machete sword fighting technique and gains faith in her abilities and resourcefulness, but also sees how when you try to help people they might not help you when you need it or even be that much better off themselves. She'll return in time to see the larger force destroying her home and killing the people she loved. But the lessons of the her journey means she knows enough that rushing in would only be her own death and would change nothing.\n\nShe makes a plan to ambush the antagonist leader, which goes mostly successfully. They battle in a 1 on 1 duel at the end, the antagonist almost bests her, and in doing so he damages her eye. But in taking the time to gloat the protagonist uses a dirty trick to free herself and kill him.\n\nThe end of the movie can be her cutting a piece of fabric from the antagonists clothes to use as a makeshift eye patch. She sheaths her machete swords and gets on her motorcycle. The voice over of her riding off into the sunset leaving the burning remains of her home behind would be as follows \"Once again max, with out meaning to or even knowing, saved my life and changed me forever. Now I wander the wastes with out a home or a cause. I finally understand the man I once thought of as a hero, and I know that he was just a victim.\"\n\nNow we're set up for a series of road warrior movies starring a badass one eye'd machete wielding biker girl.

Something similar to, one of the surviving tribesman or tribeswoman, probably a parent of the children - suicides the children to prevent them from a life of being immortan's baby factory. \n\nAt this point, Furiosa flashes back and remembers her own mother's attempt to take both their lives and her final cry of desperation as she realizes she failed and Furiosa falls into Younger Immortan's arms. \n\nAt the end, as Immortan honors his best warboys, and announces that furiosa is now his best imperator, Charlize Theron does her best to earn another Oscar by portraying a Furiosa who has to look honored, and also at the same time, hatching a plan to free the current wives.

Pacifists are wearing white costuming running away from Immortan's guzzoline convoy. Stained Red as they die off one by one. \n * Furiosa's Mother attempting to double suicide, Young Immortan just overpowering her and ripping Furiosa away without even trying. Leaving the mother to die in a pit (depending on how they want to de-age him, he could be a different, much stronger, much more menacing actor than the older Immortan... i call him Immortan Prime?) \n * Subplot of Organic (or someone similar) making Furiosa's arm - and commenting about how it won't do her any good because she's worthless for breeding, and more worthless than halflife war boys if she can't fight for a damn. \n * Remember how hard Nux tried to impress Immortan? At least one scene of Furiosa looking just as desperate to make an impression on Immortan. She's DRIVEN from the start, but misguided. This explains why she's so capable, but makes a turn for the good later.\n * The war rig, driven for actual war instead of escape, by a previous Imperator, a ruthless one. I assume due to plot purposes that Furiosa would end up driving it at one point and end up being the one of the things to impress Immortan. This time, the war rig never stops and is never defeated. The Pacifists would always be on the run, and the only way to slow the war party down is for the pacifists to sacrifice part of their convoy as decoys every time the war party gets too close. \n * One long shot, a climax character moment for Furiosa as she climbs aboard the longest car of the pacifist's convoy. She has her 'Old Boy' hallway moment where she fights her way forward and wins on pure will alone and we end on her face gritting her teeth as she kills the last person on that rig (is this my Witness Me! moment? Maybe). It ends with her killing a mother and saving a child (for immortan). Good for you Furiosa, you've become your own mother's murderer - feel good? \n * She should start out driving a small car, and slowly throughout the movie (through circumstance) drive bigger and bigger vehicles until her character's 'turn' and then when awarded imperator title, she slips into the war rig by Immortan's blessing. She should look disgusted when being passed that wheel.

The concept of hinging the story on a slowly dissolving case of hero worship in world gone south is not only unique but offers some great possibilities for putting dramatic weight on the action sequences as the movie progresses. What do you do when the movie has no hero? Someone already in the movie has to become the hero!  \n  \nMotorcycle Machete Girl's grown up only knowing the world as post-apocalyptic and sees adventure in the world outside the safety of the village in a way that only a young, immortal-feeling teen can. She's always had excellent vision and keeps her motorcycle and weaponry in peak condition, revelling  in her role as a scout, loving every second she's out in the wastelands. The older people that established the stronghold and fought hard to maintain it, wanting to keep their children safe, can remember the world as it was and it's descent into chaos. She's respectful and disciplined but the tales she wants to hear from the elders aren't about the dangers in the outside world or the importance of checking in on time but the exciting tales of Max. The man without a village! A lone, capable force out in the wild. In tribute to her hero and true to way the characters speak in these movies with broken syntax and half-remembered phrases (\"guzzoline\" \"kamakrazee\" \"they words it planet earth\") she has a habit of repurposing the phrase \"to the max\" and applying it to anything exciting. \n  \nThe Elder is like a godparent to the Motorcycle Girl. He and the other elders set up the village as far off the beaten path as possible. There are the occasional raids but usually by small bands of near-starving bandits. He lives in fear that as far away and as well-hidden as they are eventually someone will stumble across it in strength and numbers too big to fight against for long. Motorcycle Girl comes around often under the pretence of needing some bit of gear for her bike but just pesters him for stories of Max. He doles them out but no matter how hard he tries he realizes that she'll never understand how harrowing it was and at what human cost these seeming 'adventures' came. Here's some dialogue to set up a few things (with a meta-nod to the strange continuity of the Max films.)\n  \nElder: \"It wasn't some great story like you think. It was bloody and hard and filled with death. The ones that made it here weren't the best or the bravest just the luckiest.  You're a great scout but, I swear, it's the only time your vision is clouded. Besides, I've told you all the stories I know.\"  \n  \nMotorcycle Girl: \"But, you tell 'em different every time. There's always some bit you've changed or a piece that doesn't match up. Like where Max is now.\"   \n  \nElder:\"I've told you where Max is now. He rode away. Likely dead. No one can survive out there. Not even him in that pipe\". \n  \nMotorcycle Girl: \"Pipe? You said he rode away! What's this pipe?\"  \n  \nNow we have a few threads to weave though the story you've laid out.  \n  \nThe Mad Max series always had a few cool locations. Maybe the \"village\" is in and underground parking garage that survived the nukes (shades of 'Tomorrowmorrowland\") with families setting up in the car stalls like neighbouring houses. The surface building is mostly blown away, half covered by sand dunes and looks almost invisible from a distance keeping it pretty safe. Most of the few ways in and out are long tunnels or little pop-up trap doors, also used for snaring any lone scavenger types that come poking around. But one day a massive storm blows in and reveals the structure. The classic band of marauders spots it and starts closing in! \n   \nKnowing they're vulnerable the elders send out a few scouts,  Motorcycle Girl among them. We see them ride their bikes through these long skinny tunnels and pop out of different exit points at various edges of the village. With her very good vision she spots the marauders first. A massive mobile army rolls in on the horizon. It's much bigger than the infrequent and small roving groups of scavengers she's used to. Looking across the dunes and noticing that her fellow scouts haven't seen them yet panic starts to set in. She knows she should get back into the tunnel and zip back to the village to warn them.  After a tense moment she yells out to them knowing that she's giving away her position. Sure enough a few of the attackers peal off from the main force and head her way. Motorcycle girl cranks up her bike and zips across the sand to help one of the scouts now embroiled in a dust up with the marauders, being chased the whole time. From the speeding motorbike she takes a few baddies out with some surprisingly deft use of the machete. Her immediate attackers dealt with, she smiles, losing herself in a momentary victory but glances up to see the other scouts getting slaughtered. She stops the bike dead.  \n  \nThis is when it really sinks in. They're screaming and dying. Re-evaluating the scene around her she sees she's the last one on the vast plane between her and her home. And the attackers all turn their attention to her.   \n  \nNow an awful breakneck chase back to the tunnel entrance (bullets zipping past, a few cars smashing on impact with the edges of the tunnel as she squeaks in). Kicking the post holding the door open it slams shut behind her. A car slams through it but jams in the entrance. She speeds through the winding tunnel back to the village which is in a panic. A few of the marauders have gotten into the tunnels and are trying to make their way to the interior of the village. She finds The Elder. He's glad to see her back inside as safe as massive steel doors are being rolled into place at the tunnel adits. He tells her with the tunnels being too narrow to get a big vehicle in and most of them having intentional twists, turns and dead ends the invaders will have to come in on foot and hopefully get lost. \n  \n Motorcycle Girl tells him about how many she saw out there. Many more than they've ever had to deal with. \"I'm going to find him\". The Elder reluctantly agrees and gives her the sack of bullets and a vaguely described direction to 'the pipe'. Here's the first action set piece:   \n  \nThey roll back the steel doors and Motorcycle girl rolls her bike in. The Elder says \"Keep your light off. You know these tunnels, they don't\" She says \"To the max\". (It's just something she says but, it's also WHERE SHE'S GOING. Heavy-handed, maybe but, hey this is first draft) One last look back she guns it.  \n   \nCut to the outside entrance to the tunnel the bad guys are pulling the car wreckage out and the leader is calling for a bunch of nasties on  motorbikes and ATVs to go in.  \n The tunnel is lit by torches, some kerosene sconces and a few tall candles close enough together that you can see more than one but far apart enough that there are big stretches of pitch black (possibly enemy-enshrouding) unknown in between. Without giving a blow-by-blow of what happens there are a lot of exciting possiblities in this scenario: the machete being implemented with the speed of a motorcycle behind it, Motorcycle Girl using her knowledge of the tunnel system to smash invaders on quad bikes into each other, hell, dispatching a couple of motorbike punks can be told in a series of moments punctuated with the light/dark/light of travelling through the tunnel, and maybe end it with a Wile Coyote-style cave-in as she reaches the exit.  \n  \nThis gives us something we haven't seen before. A Mad Max car battle mixed with claustrophobia. And don't forget she's still gotta outrun the rest of the gang once she's out there!  \n  \nThat's just an example of where your excellent premise can start. You can have fun with the big bad being some kind of inverted version of Max (maybe he looks like some drawing Motorcycle girl made of how she imagined Max, calling her to question her beliefs) and pay off the 'scout with great vision losing an eye but somehow seeing with greater depth' thing.  \n  \nBut, follow your outline and when, after a continual series of death defying chases and escapes she's lost her motorcycle and is nearly exhausted in the wasteland, she eventually discovers 'the pipe'. It's actually an old Quonset hut half buried in the dunes (shot and designed to mirror a smaller version of 'the village', reminding her of what she's been fighting for). She digs her way inside. No Max. There are some supplies, though. Guns, water, ammunition, guzzoline. Clearly someone did live here. Her eyes light up...  \n  \nCut to: Exterior. The Pipe.  \nBursting forth in a flurry of sand and roaring like a beast the V8 Interceptor with our girl at the wheel, loaded with weapons and she's not coming back with Max, she's coming back as Max.  \n  \n**TL;DR** an expansion of the plot outline by u/TheDreadPirateBikke \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n ", "created_utc": 1499840960.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1499841670.0, "id": "dk3xr0y", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6mo2mw", "parent_id": "t1_dk3h573", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6mo2mw/charlize_theron_says_script_for_mad_max_prequel/dk3xr0y/", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "gonesnake", "author_id": "7bnkf", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "When Lord and Miller were fired from the project, it was said that they made the character too funny and a lot like Ace Ventura", "created_utc": 1499825933.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dk3oj7y", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6mo2mw", "parent_id": "t1_dk3i20l", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6mo2mw/charlize_theron_says_script_for_mad_max_prequel/dk3oj7y/", "score": 13, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "troyisprettydamncool", "author_id": "5xhv3", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "2 Max 2 Furiosa", "created_utc": 1499809385.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dk3bmsk", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6mo2mw", "parent_id": "t1_dk3a8ff", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6mo2mw/charlize_theron_says_script_for_mad_max_prequel/dk3bmsk/", "score": 49, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "gtrogers", "author_id": "3s944", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "id watch that.", "created_utc": 1499809372.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dk3bmdp", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6mo2mw", "parent_id": "t1_dk3a8ff", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6mo2mw/charlize_theron_says_script_for_mad_max_prequel/dk3bmdp/", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Managarn", "author_id": "dbolz", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Patrolling the Mojave Almost Makes You Wish For a Nuclear Winter.", "created_utc": 1499810688.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dk3cs6s", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6mo2mw", "parent_id": "t1_dk3a8ff", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6mo2mw/charlize_theron_says_script_for_mad_max_prequel/dk3cs6s/", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "SpiderFnJerusalem", "author_id": "c9lg0", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "That's what I love about Mad Max.

How could they have known they'd make a prequel? I tend to just think of it as Indy saving face, even if it is in front of Marcus Brody, a trusted colleague of his.\n\nIt's an important issue because the nature of the supernatural is imperative not just to the Indiana Jones stories in general, but to the theme of Temple of Doom. Out of the three Original Trilogy films, Doom is the one that places the most emphasis on respecting the power of the occult. Indy takes a very hardline stance against anything supernatural, an arc which is completed in the end when he admits to the village elder [that he understands the power of the Sankara stones.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elehy4EIBjc#t=2m)\n\nBetween what Indy witnesses with the thugee cult, being brainwashed by Mola Ram, and the eventual revelation of the Sankara's power, Doom is as a study into Jones' character about how he comes to understand and respect what he encounters as an archaeologist. While all three films deal with this to some extent, Doom is the one where Jones makes the clear transformation from a skeptic to a believer. It helps reinforce why he becomes such an enthusiastic artifact-chaser So it's not silly to be upset by it, because as much as Indiana Jones is a very trope-like character, he does have an arc and a set of beliefs that visibly transforms across the films.
