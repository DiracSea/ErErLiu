ASL, like any other language, has accents and regional dialects, and people who aren't fluent are easy to spot. Some people sign with the clarity and articulation of Sir Lawrence Olivier. Others sign like Borat.\n\nJohn Krasinski signs with a relaxed style that suggests he's been doing it for a long time. If he picked those nuances just for the role, good for him. He really signs like it's natural and comfortable (another standout like this is Jessica Chastain in Take Shelter). I really respect how serious Krasinski is about that detail most of us wouldn't care about and won't notice.\n\nOn the other hand, watching Dwayne Johnson sign in the trailer for Rampage is like chewing tin foil. \n\n*(Edit) I want to just include this important point: I'm fluent in ASL and I know a lot about it, so I can make casual observations, comments, and explanations. But if you want to get in-depth with ASL and receive \"definitive\" answers, you need to go to a native speaker. In other words, a deaf person. It's one thing for a hearing person to bounce around a few comments and \"Did you know\"s like I'm doing, but ASL belongs to the deaf and if you want the real deal that's where you have to turn.*\n\n", "created_utc": 1523118141.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1523225815.0, "id": "dwz047s", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8ai3m1", "parent_id": "t3_8ai3m1", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8ai3m1/john_krasinski_pushed_to_cast_a_deaf_actress_for/dwz047s/", "score": 5063, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "My favorite horror movie in years.
