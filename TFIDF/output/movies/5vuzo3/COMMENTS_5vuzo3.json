I can't believe you have a positive score on that comment! This is the first time I've seen the GITS casting discussed without the comments being full of people who have clearly never paid attention to the physical traits of the Major's shell. \n\nI remember when I imported the original GITS VHS and being blown away by every single aspect of the film. I watched it over and over. I even played it for people who had never even heard of japanimation (which was most adults in the mid-to-late 90s). The stigma that came with being a grown adult who watched and collected weird Japanese cartoons in 90s was so negative that I lost some friends over it. To a lot of people, the base assumptions were that you were a pedophile and/or you had a legitimate learning disability. But GITS was so different, and it was clearly made for adults given its heavy philosophical and existential themes, that I would occasionally take the risk of showing it to people. And over the years, I ended up showing to a ton of people. \n\nBesides the awesome nostalgia trip, the reason I wrote all of that was to say that all of these people having their first anime experience presented an interesting trend. They would ask me why the Major was white. It had stood out to me at first too, but I took it as yet another way the film posed its existential questions. But it has always seemed clear to me that she's white. In fact, I never questioned it al all  until the new film was announced and I saw people here on Reddit throwing fits of rage over the whitewashing of her character. Needing no excuse to watch the original film again, I had a viewing where I focused solely on the race and ethnicity of the characters and I came away with the same opinion that I previously had. \n\nFor visually obvious reasons, the Major is white. And while I fully support this amazing movement to stop whitewashing in our media, the GITS film does not apply with regard to the Major. To be completely honest, I feel like the people fighting against this film are making themselves a detriment to the movement as a whole. Because these people are ignorantly spouting off bullshit that doesn't apply to this film, it's clear to everyone paying attention that this group of people who have taken this up as a personal cause aren't even paying enough attention to the trendy topic du jour to verify that it's actually relevant to their cause. And in the end, movements that are run like that always fizzle out. So if they actually cared about the movement's end results they would just quietly move on to the next project that needs attention, and they would make sure that they actually know what they're talking about going forward. I honestly hope they stop fucking this up because this is one of those areas where our society is so obviously wrong (to the point of being harmful to large numbers of people in our society) and it's such an easy issue to fix with the proper level of social awareness. \n\nTL;DR - She's white you fucking socially irresponsible assholes.

The original anime was created before the manga had ended, and eventually caught up, around halfway through the anime's run. At that point the anime diverges and creates a separate ending to the series. Because people wanted to see a more faithful adaptation, they remade the series later after the manga ended, with larger production values.\n\nAs /u/exelion18120 said, you *can* watch both series. However, I say you *should*. I say this because most other people would recommend you skip the original and go straight to the remake, as it's considered the superior product. I tend to agree, however, a problem in the remake is that at the time the original diverged from the manga, it was on episode 26, while the remake got to the same point in only 13 episodes. The remakes pacing in first few episodes is far too quick because of thiss, and they really suffer, with some of the best storylines in the anime getting crammed together and not having enough time to develop properly. There is one particular storyline that's one of the most famous stories in really all of anime. It's gut wrenching in the original, so much so that I had to stop watching for a while when I first watched, because it involves characters that we got to know over a few episodes, but in the remake it's not as impactful, the characters are introduced in the same episode and then never brought up again.\n\nHonestly, I recommend the original first based on that one story alone.

Thank God for the Stay/Night Type Moon remake.\n\n\nAlso Samurai Champloo came out 05 and has aged really, really well. It's my favorite.\n\nCowboy Bebop is like the 90's too?
