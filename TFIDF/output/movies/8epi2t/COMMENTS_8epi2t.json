The Fan had the stalker plot about Robert Deniro becoming obsessed with Wesley Snipe's baseball character, yet Deniro's character had a fairly bold personality.

Travolta may be a (formerly) big star, yet he's proven himself to be good at these smaller, lonelier characters.  I really liked the scenes in the movie Phenomenom of him being confused or feeling isolated by his character's newfound special abilities.  \n\nI also liked him in Mad City with Dustin Hoffman, in which he played a soft-spoken musuem employee who loses his job and becomes desperate to get it back.  His character in that one is technically doing something \"bad\" yet you can't help but feel bad for him.

He had shirts made that said \"Limp Bizkit Sucks\" so he could make money from anyone that hated or liked the band.
