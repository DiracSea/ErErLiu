I had told them in advance that I would be away (I had been an actor since I was four, so this wasn\u2019t really news) but during the long shoot it became too much of an issue for them. I don\u2019t really blame them \u2013 it was very unusual, especially in the Canadian suburbs, in the early 90s. \nAs for the legality of it all, I really don\u2019t know. I was embarrassed and didn\u2019t want to be somewhere I wasn\u2019t wanted \u2013 so we didn\u2019t fight it. I ended up attending a private school after that, for a short time. They also struggled with accommodating my strange work schedule. I was told that wasn\u2019t a good fit, either. So, I never graduated from high school. When I was in my twenties, after I left LA and retired from acting, I got my GED. When I was thirty-one, I graduated from the University of Virginia. I still live in VA, and I'm a writer now.

Personally I think this rule should be a guideline and the only thing that determines your grade is your performance on the tests, since that's all they care about anyways.

I would never skip every class, but anyone who says you will miss something every class, you have no idea how little you're actually missing most times.

It feels like exploitation of students. If the teacher needs an assistant, pay someone to be that teacher's assistant, or pay a student who wants to be a teacher as their career to get work experience lecturing with the teacher chiming in when necessary. But don't force students to come grade your papers because you're a lazy fuck. \n\nIn my experience, this did several things: 1, The teachers were encouraged to give multiple guess exams instead of writing out their answers in prose form. Prose form answers force you to use grammar and drastically reduces guessing the correct answer. 2, Some students cheated giving their friends better grades or the opposite. 3, It robs the student of an opportunity for learning.

I do this till maybe a month before graduation when I get called up to the office from my first period class..like 8am sit in char..8:01...\"Yo get your ass in the office now.\" \n\nCome to find out they had a problem with me not going to class AFTER lunch even though they were electives which I didn't need and I knew I only needed the two classes in the morning to graduate. They tell me that it doesn't work that way (uhh yeah it does I get credits I graduate) and now have to actually go to \"School,\" The whole day and get the teachers signatures saying that they \"Allow,\" Me to graduate (the fuck) .
