He went through tonnes of iterations and brought it to a few different companies who had differing visions, even turning it into one movie.

It took away a lot of the philosophical elements and replaced them with a more cult like and eldritch atmosphere. It was also, as another poster said, terribly acted. It's important to note that this was Lynch's first attempt at a mega-picture in terms of scale. His previous work was smaller in scope, location, and cast by miles. \n\nI still think it's necessary to watch it though, because it perfectly encapsulates the pre-Star Wars Sci-Fi mindset. They (the studios) wanted to capitalize on Star Wars without actually taking the time to understand why it was such a success. They chose a director who seemed to garner acclaim, but who they didn't understand. And Lynch himself was not really the right choice because he wasn't steeped in the concept of Sci-Fi that made Herbert's works so influential (e.g. standing on the line between sci-fi and fantasy). Lynch's films emphasize social and psychological horror, the wonderful macabre of humanity's spirit and what we waste of it. Dune had elements of this, but saw beyond it as well. Grotesqueries were simply part of the fabric of the universe, not any particular villain or hero in and of themselves. This all combined to create something that wasn't able to dwell in any specific corner of art, philosophy, or entertainment.

I'm not sure if there was any, but I didn't catch any buzz about Arrival prior to its release, and even though the trailer for the movie aired before several of the movies I saw last year, I didn't pay much attention to it, because it didn't seem all that interesting to me, I thought it would be a boring first contact story. But right after its release, I noticed people were raving about it on reddit, so I looked it up on the internet and it did seem to be received very positively. And man, was I blown away. It is much better,  than Prisoners and Sicario, and that says A LOT. I had to look him up after this, and only then did I realize that he was already one of my favorite directors. I've seen Enemy recommended many times before, too, so I checked that out, as well, and it's amazing, too (although the three other ones I mentioned previously are better, imo).\n\nI'm really stoked to see what he does with Blade Runner.
