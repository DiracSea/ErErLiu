[Credits](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1198059/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1).\n  \nCredits are a touchy issue on all sides. The fact is that it takes a shit-ton of people to create these movies, and the majority of them are in VFX... by far. There's many political and monetary factors that go into credits that people don't realize, but the main one is the fear of unionization.\n  \nCredits are used in deal making. VFX supervisor and producer credits are now featured on their own cards in the beginning of the movie. That's because Hollywood agencies have pushed for them in the past 10 years since VFX department heads are pretty much capped at a $10k a week rate. That sounds like a shit ton of money, but other department heads are capped at that rate due to their union rules. So a cinematographer who's been working in Hollywood since the 80's has probably been making $10k a week since the 90's-00's. Though VFX is not part of a union, the studios know that if they paid their department heads more then the unions would come after them. So veteran VFX supervisors are capped, which means they have to look for other ways to get a good deal, and one of those ways is a credit.\n  \nThis is an elaborate way of saying that credits are part of a struggle within the industry to classify work, workers, pay scale, and most importantly union involvement. If you took all the people who worked on a large movie and gave them a credit, you would see a HUGE difference in the amount of VFX people that put their hands on the film. This would tip off the unions to say wait a second, how much power do we really have over collective bargaining if 40% of the movie is done in VFX? That would drive unions harder to go after a VFX union because that amount of non-union people could affect their bargaining power. Like I mentioned above, the deals that VFX people make can affect the deals that the non-VFX people make.\n  \nAlso, movies have always been skewed toward the production phase. You could be a PA on a film for the production and get a credit, but a PA in post production might not. That's from a 100 year old culture within the film industry that cherishes the set life. Post production is just a bunch of nerds putting the film together. But what we're seeing is a shift from a three part system (pre, during, post), to a one part system. Post production teams are being assembled even before shooting begins, because they have to cut animatics, previs, and rough assemblies of the footage. As a VFX production person myself I have to be on during all three phases, even though 90% of our work is done in post, and we start asset building and postvis right out of the camera gate. Hollywood has not caught up to this line of thinking. That the film set is only shooting 60% of your movie, the other 40% is done in VFX. So we're no longer \"visual effects\" but \"digital production\".\n  \nSo it's a classic case of Hollywood wanting its cake and eating it too. They want the magic that VFX affords them, but they don't want to pay for it or give it proper credit, or even a union. The main attitude of Hollywood is \"you're privileged just to work here\". That's how it gets away with everything from fucking over VFX companies to fucking their assistants. It's the unions who go \"fuck you, pay us\", but right now the VFX industry is being led by old men who don't want to ruffle the feathers of Hollywood, and their own standing in the industry, and refuse to form a coalition to fight this. (I'm looking at you, VES). But the more dependent they are on VFX, the more people, in every country, is going to get sick of it and finally unionize.", "created_utc": 1514315858.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "drsbwd5", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7m8jj0", "parent_id": "t1_drs4xt3", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7m8jj0/about_60_artists_who_created_hero_makeups_and/drsbwd5/", "score": 20, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "CalvinDehaze", "author_id": "6veek", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I never get documented credit for any of my work.

They sue little food trucks that have star wars puns as their name into oblivion (look up Grillenium Falcon). \n\nIt is like dealing with the mob.
