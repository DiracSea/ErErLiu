I didn\u2019t know if I wanted to do it because it felt too similar to the jet ski data and I didnt\u2019 want to rehash material. However, I felt bad that I was turning down so many requests and I\u2019m always down to point out that jet ski action scenes are terrible, so I went ahead and researched the scenes (there are many snowmobile sites that complain about the usage of snowmobiles in movies) and crunched the numbers on the action scenes!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI knew the numbers would be better than jet ski movies, however, I was surprised that there weren\u2019t that many of them. I did a A LOT of research and thought I\u2019d have a list around 50 to 60 movies. I ended up with 22 movies that had reliable box office data and critical scores. I had to leave movies like *Tripwire, Santa's Slay* or\u00a0*Icebreaker* (watch it\u2026Bruce Campbell is the villain) out because they didn\u2019t have critical scores or weren\u2019t released theatrically.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat constitutes a snowmobile action scene? They are scenes that feature an action set piece involving chases, jumps, spills and beheadings while on snowmobiles. It can\u2019t just be a person riding a snowmobile on his way to an action scene. It has to feature spills, chills, bullets, carnage, avalanches or massive jumps. Watch this [***Die Hard 2***](https://youtu.be/3_zKy7ygsHY) clip and you will know what I\u2019m talking about.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSidenote: I scoured the internet for every snowmobile action scene I could find. If I missed anything please let me know and send a clip.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Here are the numbers for movies featuring snowmobile action scenes**\n\n* **Total Number of Movies** \u2013 22 \u2013 *Die Hard 2, Snow Day, True Lies, A View to a Kill, The Living Daylights, xXx, The World is Not Enough, Babylon A.D.,* ***Inception***, *The Fate of the Furious, Jackie Chan\u2019s First Strike, Die Another Day, Agent Cody Banks, Johnny English Reborn, The Santa Clause 2, Fred Claus, Mr. Magoo, Wrong Turn 4: Bloody Beginnings* (no box office), *Braven* (no box office), *Lederhosen Zombies* (no box office), *22 July* (no box office), *Deadfall* (no box office)\n* **Tomatometer Average** \u2013 50%\n* **Domestic Box Office (inflated)** \u2013 $156 million\n* **Worldwide Box Office (inflated)** \u2013 $350 million\n* **Budget (inflated)** \u2013 $107 million\n\n\\* I had to make some changes because of the late additions of *Mr. Magoo, 22 July, Deadfall* and *Meet the Deedles*. The real lundgren would be very bummed that I missed these movies. Also, I love *Wind River* but it doesn\u2019t feature any snowmobile action scenes. I figured I would put this here because it will most likely be brought up.\n\n**Here are the numbers for jet ski action scene movies (for comparison):**\n\n* **Total Number of Movies**\u00a0\u2013 17 \u2013 *The Pacifier, Hard Rain, Waterworld, Double Dragon, Transporter 2, Transporter: Refueled, Speed 2, Shark Night, Deep Rising, Fool\u2019s Gold, Piranha 3D, Baywatch, Police Academy 3: Back in Training, You Don't Mess With the Zohan, Meet the Deedles, Universal Soldier: The Return, Dhoom 3, Manhunt (no box office)*\n* **Tomatometer Average** \u2013 30%\n* **Domestic Box Office (inflated)** \u2013 $61 million\n* **Worldwide Box Office (inflated)** \u2013 $122 million\n* **Budget (inflated)** \u2013 $73 million\n\nWhy are the numbers higher than jet ski action movies? Here is a list that features zero correlation or causation.\n\n1. Snowmobile action scenes have realistic and life threatening stakes. If you wipe out on a snowmobile you are in trouble. Thus, they are much more exciting and won\u2019t make you fall asleep like you do when a jet ski action scene comes on (I literally passed out during the jet ski chase in *Baywatch*)\n2. Vin Diesel loves snowmobile action scenes more than he loves jet ski action scenes. *The Fate of the Furious, xXx, and Babylon A.D*. **>** *The Pacifier*\n3. *The Fate of the Furious, Inception, Die Hard 2, The Living Daylights, A View to a Kill, The World is Not Enough, Die Another Day* and *The Living Daylights* all made over $300 million at the worldwide box office.\n4. Jet ski action scenes basically feature people going in straight lines\u2026\u2026\n5. 35% (7) of the snowmobile action scene movies have fresh (60%+) Tomatometer scores.\n6. 7% (1) of the jet ski action scene movies have a fresh Tomatometer score\n7. Directors like James Cameron (*True Lies*), Christopher Nolan (*Inception*), Renny Harlin (*Die Hard 2*) and F. Gary Gray (*The Fate of the Furious*) trust snowmobiles enough to include them in their action scenes.\n8. Have you watched the jet ski action scene in *Hard Rain*?\n9. James Bond loves snowmobiles.\n10. The conclusion to the snowmobile chase in [**Wrong Turn 4 is bonkers**](https://youtu.be/D9m2uoWoFr8).\n\nMovies featuring snowmobile action scenes **>** Movies featuring jet ski action scenes. The result of this totally unwarranted competition was never in doubt, however, I enjoyed finding out the results so I could write this data piece.\n\nIf you like this article make sure to check out my other data pieces!\n\n[Analyzing the unnecessarily large trap in Predators](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8lazju/the_unsuccessful_and_unnecessarily_large_trap/)\n\n[JCVD and his splits](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6slzyy/movies_that_feature_jcvd_doing_3_splits_have_a/)\n\n[How Far Did the Shark Travel in Jaws: The Revenge?](https://old.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/922rgz/during_its_18_day_brody_hunt_the_psychic_shark_in/)\n\n[Matthew McConaughey's massive jump in Reign of Fire](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6r5tjv/matthew_mcconaughey_broke_every_long_jump_record/)\n\n[How Far Does the Creature From It Follows Travel?](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7xzadn/im_a_big_fan_of_the_creature_in_it_follows_so_i/)\n\n[People love a bearded Kurt Russell](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6mvjgj/movies_that_feature_a_beardedmustachioed_kurt/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=api&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=movies)\n\n[Tracking the Merman's Murderous Journey](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6k2kwl/after_analyzing_the_underground_corridors_and/)\n\n[Michael Myers road trip in Halloween H20](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6bicq9/after_researching_various_maps_1971_buick_skylark/)\n\n[Stellan Skarsgard's journey in Deep Blue Sea was gnarly](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6adtem/after_a_fair_amount_of_research_calculations_and/)\n\n[How Fast Can Leatherface Run?](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6g10u4/the_texas_chainsaw_massacre_remake_has_taught_me/)\n\n[Jet Ski Action Scenes Are the Worst](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5ckqc0/movies_that_feature_jet_ski_action_scenes_have_an/)\n\n[The Fast & Furious & Corona](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/64tine/the_fast_and_the_furious_movies_that_feature/)\n\n[How Did the Geologist Get Lost in Prometheus?](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6ogg4n/after_lots_of_research_guesswork_and_analyzing/)\n\n[How Long Does it Take Horror Villains to Travel From NYC to San Francisco?](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/6xe3ra/after_analyzing_hiking_trails_gas_stops_and_how/)\n\n[Michael Myers Hates Using His Turn Signal](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/79nnfd/i_originally_guessed_that_michael_myers_used_his/)\n\n[Can Jason Voorhees teleport?](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/764lpp/after_analyzing_the_dimensions_of_the_disco/)\n\n[How Long Did the Joker Need to Setup the Weapon Circle in Suicide Squad?](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7dd36u/the_joker_needed_at_least_65_minutes_to_lay_out/)\n\n[How Much Sand Did Elektra's Sandbag Trainer in Daredevil (2003) Require?](https://old.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/905y4r/elektras_sandbag_trainer_in_daredevil_2003/)\n\n[Breaking down The Mariner vs. Sea Eater battle in Waterworld](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7qsqzr/the_kevin_costner_vs_sea_eater_scene_in/)\n\n[Analyzing the Posters for Nicholas Sparks' Book Adaptations](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/7xj0wq/movies_adapted_from_nicholas_sparks_books_that/)\n\n[How far Did Nic Cage Run Around in a Bear Suit in The Wicker Man Remake?](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/84diy0/i_love_it_when_nic_cage_runs_amok_while_disguised/)\n\n[How Many Bullets Missed John Matrix in Commando?](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/994tn1/an_estimated_3007_bullets_flew_past_john_matrix/)\n\n[Michael Myers Loves Doing Laundry](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9p9nch/halloween_movies_featuring_michael_myers_using/)\n\n[Dolph Lundgren and His Front Kicks](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/9qpeu4/im_pleased_to_announce_that_dolph_lundgren_movies/)\n\n[Kevin Bacon and His Collegiate Degrees](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/a2e6d6/movies_featuring_kevin_bacon_make_more_money_and/)\n\n&#x200B;", "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "title": "Movies featuring snowmobile action scenes have an average critical score of 51% and average an inflated $369 million worldwide on $111 million budgets.
