Russia is monumental in size, it covers a huge area of the Earth and it encompasses countless different cultures, beliefs, and identities. It\u2019s size is it\u2019s biggest strength and weakness, it gives Russia space from its neighbors. There are little to no natural mountains or dense forests that separate Russia from Western Europe, so they expanded East to allow for retreats during wartime. They employed this tactic when Hitler tried to invade and it worked well, even if the poor timing of Hitler proved to be the most destructive factor. It\u2019s also it\u2019s biggest weakness, outside of Western Russia it\u2019s another world. It\u2019s hard to explain but it\u2019s the real Wild West and it\u2019s pure chaos. Authoritarian leaders hold it together, without a Tsar, a Lenin, a Stalin, a Gorbachev, a Yeltsin, or a Putin there wouldn\u2019t be Russia. It would break apart to infighting and the various regions would become separate states. Russia would disappear over night. It\u2019s nearly happened in modern times but Putin avoided it.\n\nThe problem is Putin will die, and he has no successor and there is no telling what will happen when he dies. It could spark a civil war, infighting to the East or another authoritarian leader will emerge. Putin is dipping in popularity and he\u2019s losing his grasp of the regions. Dagestan has been a big concern lately and they are defying Moscow more and more. The regional authorities are slowly growing more and more defiant and they are seizing power for themselves. Putin is trying to hold it together and one of his strategies is to bolster the idea of a national identity. A myth in Russia because it\u2019s so big. He took to rebrithing Stalinism in a sense, he\u2019s using Stalin to appeal to the older generations and working class. It\u2019s like Trumps MAGA. The banning of this movie was a show, it was Putin saying Stalin needs respect and Stalin was a great man, and Stalin is doing what Putin is doing so this must also mean Putin is a great man. It\u2019s hard to explain, but that\u2019s kind of the gist of it. He\u2019s creating a cult of personality and then highlighting how alike he and Stalin are as leaders and he\u2019s hoping this will boost his popularity. Sochi, and Crimea were also examples of Putin trying to make Russia great again. He\u2019s trying to push the national identity in a hope that it will hold the federation together.\n\n\nRussia is a mystery, and it\u2019s also familiar. I would recommend visiting to anyone. When Putin dies it will be the dawn of a new era, an era of tighter state control or an ear of war. Inter-state relations are very tense right now, and Moscow can only subsidize the entire country for so long. The international sanctions are truely crippling Moscow and money is running out. You don\u2019t need to travel far in London, Berlin, Paris, Brussels, or Amsterdam before you run into a large mansion owned by a Russian millionaire. People are fleeing, and they\u2019re bringing what\u2019s left of the money with them.

During communism, in Slovakia, the russians would parade around like they were God's chosen children and they made sure you knew it. Doesn't matter if they only had 3 teeth and a kindergarten education, they would talk down to you like you were beneath them simply because they had a golden age of culture like 100 years ago and they're still talking about it. Russians are the 2nd fakest people. If you know a Russian that isn't like this, it's because they don't live in Russia anymore for a reason. \n\nThis isn't universal, but it is why they suck so much as a culture.\n\nSource: Am slovak.\n\nEdit: If you're wondering who the #1 fakest culture is, it's Japanese. If you don't know why, you don't know the Japanese for the last 1,000 years. A fake smile and disingenuous laugh is the epitome of being Japanese up until very very recently.

Overall, its quite popular among the unambitious people who mostly live away from central hubs (so-call Provincia).  \n* VK is the most popular social network in Russia. It secured its place on top thanks to several key factors, such as responsive and fast development (lots of different features unrolled early, it kept improving for a while, at the same time trying not to become as bloated and convoluted as Facebook), libertarian approach to media (for a while you could find pretty much any movie or show here, but then they've since struck deals with copyright holders and essentially provided subscription video on demand services to users; same goes for audio - it's very easy to create own playlists accessible to users anywhere) and, well, I guess porn played its part - yes, there's a shitload of porn at VK. Also, memes. Yeah, there are a bunch of public groups with several million subscribers each, and they spew entertainment over its users on an hourly basis. Unsurprisingly, almost everyone in Russia who's online has a VK account for one reason or the other, even if it's only to access a playlist or browse dank memes.  \n* And then there's FB. Most Russians here are 'enlightened individuals' for better or worse, who use the platform either to communicate with overseas contacts (friends, coworkers) or as a digital soapbox.

To quote the American humorist Kin Hubbard, 'It ain\u2019t no disgrace to be poor, but it might as well be.' It is in fact a crime for an American to be poor, even though America is a nation of poor. Every other nation has folk traditions of men who were poor but extremely wise and virtuous, and therefore more estimable than anyone with power and gold. No such tales are told by the American poor. They mock themselves and glorify their betters. The meanest eating or drinking establishment, owned by a man who is himself poor, is very likely to have a sign on its wall asking this cruel question: 'if you\u2019re so smart, why ain\u2019t you rich?' There will also be an American flag no larger than a child\u2019s hand \u2013 glued to a lollipop stick and flying from the cash register.\n\nAmericans, like human beings everywhere, believe many things that are obviously untrue. Their most destructive untruth is that it is very easy for any American to make money. They will not acknowledge how in fact hard money is to come by, and, therefore, those who have no money blame and blame and blame themselves. This inward blame has been a treasure for the rich and powerful, who have had to do less for their poor, publicly and privately, than any other ruling class since, say Napoleonic times. Many novelties have come from America. The most startling of these, a thing without precedent, is a mass of undignified poor.

I'm German and what you describe regarding Russian forums sounds somewhat familiar, not necessarily the mocking but that beyond the English speaking Internet there are a couple of other, quite well self-contained bubbles where people speak other languages: Chinese, French, German, Portugese(?), Turkish and very prominently Russian, you see the latter clash with other such language spheres if a game or so doesn't allow people to self segregate and you suddenly have french and russian speaking people in your CS:GO match and both sides feeling entitled to speak their mothertongue which doesn't fare well.\n\nPicking sides seems often problematic in my eyes. You named the BBC ...I wouldn't call it Propaganda but British Media generally seems to have a more aggressive stand towards Russia than for example Mainland European Media, I figure thats partly an echo of Cold War politics where Mainland Europe had to arrange itself with the existence of the Soviet Bloc within reach while Britain was able/choose to go another path, closer tied to the USA and somewhat seperated from Europe. You see a similiar diversion from Europe in the British attitude towards Israel although there France also takes a more confrontational stance, both being partly rooted in them playing a role in the creation of Israel (which they opposed and wanted to avoid with the Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement). For example German (media) attitude towards Russia is less confrontational, Americans and Brits might see that as small scale finlandisation which is (argubly) true but there are reasons beyond that why the relationship is less hostile...it helps that Merkel is the only head of government who Putin can talk in Russian with.\n\nI don't like TV news networks generally because their reporting outside crisis & desaster reporting is generally pretty shallow and heavily influenced by the Network's agenda...the BBC is better than most and in my eyes *definetly* better than RT but it too has its flaws. I wonder what Al Jaazera's coverage on Russia looks like.
