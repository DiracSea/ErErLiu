Things we thought we were doing for good, have been coming back to haunt us. This trend has only intensified since 9/11.\n\nOf course, while that's interesting, I find myself more drawn to the really good people heroes in films, the ones who unabashedly work to solve problems. In the superhero realm, Captain America is electrifying in his portrayal as a good person operating in a tough world/universe. \n\nI wish we would see more of these. It's good for us to have heroes that we can aspire to be like at our best.\n\n", "created_utc": 1536950189.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e5zavmz", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_9fsj8d", "parent_id": "t1_e5z2gle", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/9fsj8d/skyfall_casino_royale_writers_neal_purvis_and/e5zavmz/", "score": 13, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "manachar", "author_id": "48g5v", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I love your take on the song.

Essentially everything you needed to know about her character is jammed into a 2 minute scene, but it\u2019s done so well that it feels natural.
