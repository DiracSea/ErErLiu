[{"body": "This shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone but this thread has been locked. \n\nEdit: Didn't have time to expand on why earlier and I have some people asking. The concept is pretty simple here. When comments that break rules and force us to ban users, for example racist or abusive comments, start coming in at a rate that we can't keep up with we lock the thread. We have jobs and lives and stuff and don't have time to make sure everyone discusses this like adults. With 1600 comments I think most viewpoints are represented somewhere in this thread, as long as it was expressed without racism or abuse it should still be visible. Feel free to upvote those but this thread stays locked.  \n\nSecond edit: Really enjoying all the PMs telling me to simply allow racism and abuse. None of that is necessary to discuss movies and this is a movies subreddit. We aren't going to throw a long standing rule away just because people are breaking it more than usual.

They took advantage of their base's natural assumption that everything he did was evil and made it out that executive orders were some kind of shady loophole that let him do things that were outside of the power of the executive branch. This, of course, was not true and Trump's initial string of orders makes the Republicans look pretty hypocritical, or it would if the public's collective memory could reach back to all those times that legislators condemned Obama for the same exact thing.
