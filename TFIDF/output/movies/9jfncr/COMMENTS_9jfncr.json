That's not a person exploding.\n\nWhen a person explodes because they're happy, it's wonderful. But sometimes people explode because they're really mad. And they might say or do things that make other people sad. They might even accidentally hurt other people too. They might not mean to, but sometimes it happens.\n\nThat's why it's important to think about what's making us get a little crazy and explode. Is is a Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan explosion where lots of people fight a lot? Or a Tom Hanks Mister Rogers explosion where everyone is happy and really wants to feel good about something? \n\nWhich do you like? I like the second one.

I think you described the mindset many people I know, myself included.\n\nYou know that meme that goes around, something like, \"you're not being the kind of person Mr. Rogers knew you could be\", and its supposed to be in reference to someone doing something bad or acting like an asshole or something? Yeah well that legit gets to me every time I see it. I feel like if I were in a situation like that, being obnoxious or spouting off my opinions in a rude way or something, and someone voiced that to me I would instantly stop and assess the situation. Am I doing my best to treat everyone fairly? Am I being honest? Am I making an effort to make the world a better place? Am I accepting people for who they are? When I grew out of the Mr. Rogers age and into teenage years and early 20s, the answer to those questions would most likely be no. As I got older though, and experienced all the shit life has to offer and hateful people, at some point I just decided to stop being so cynical. It just didn't help anything. I didn't have a revelation that I needed to be happy and good, I just realized that I was actually putting effort into being an ass, MORE effort than if I were to just be neutral! And it didn't do anything to solve problems and usually made them worse. So why not try to just NOT be so cynical? It improved my mental health and outlook on life dramatically. Not right away, it took time, but it definitely was a noticeable difference. \n\nEven later, I start seeing that meme, and recently watched that documentary. Now I've realized that I don't want to just be neutral anymore, that I need to inflict good upon the world if I want the world to be good. I'm at the phase now where it's not enough for me to just coast by and \"survive\". Is what I'm choosing to do going to change the world in a better way? I don't know, but I'm passionate about it and want to see if it is. Can I answer yes to all those questions I previously couldn't before? Probably not, but I'm trying my best, and I feel like that is all Mr. Rogers would have asked of me.
