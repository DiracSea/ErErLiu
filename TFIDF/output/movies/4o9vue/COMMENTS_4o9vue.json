I have a mental gallery of Daniel Craig's Bond eating shit in any imaginable way, that chase scene in Africa at the beginning of Casino Royale shows what he's really about. He doesn't have the same technique as the guy he's chasing, he's not as nimble, not as quick, not as skilled. His greatest asset is his endurance and the fact that he just brute-forces it. He's exceptional at taking hits, he's not a CQC master that can 1 v 1 anyone and flips around like a ninja, obviously his training made him better than most but he rarely overpowers strong opponents just because his technique is better.
