I stayed after practice at our local public course on the driving range hitting balls. I was the only one out there at the time. \n\nIt was a little before dusk and a man came down to the range a took the slot a couple spots behind me. While I was taking a break he said hi to me and asked how I was doing, just exchanging pleasantries. He noticed my clubs were Hogans, and started asking me if I knew anything about Ben Hogan. He wasn't grilling me, he was just idly asking out of curiosity and making conversation with me. He mentioned he was learning a lot about him because he had a role having to do with Hogan. We talked for a little bit before I finally put together that this was Bill Paxton. I went back to hitting balls, shared a few more words with him, and as I was leaving he said \"good luck\" on the team. I said my name is xxxxx, and shook his hand; \"Bill\" he said. Being young and a little dumbstruck I didn't tell him how much I enjoyed his work, especially in Twister. It was the first or second PG-13 movie my parents let me watch. The other was Independence Day. I do remember asking what movie the Hogan was going to be.  He said just look for a golf movie coming out next year. That was the Legend of Bagger Vance. \n\nWhat I was left with that day was the impression of a genuinely friendly person. I have jokingly called him my friend since then because we spent that 20 minutes essentially hanging out by ourselves.

Flash is cool, but it is still at its core CW formulaic. \n\n\nSHIELD is a show with plenty of Whendonisms, but I don't feel saturated by it like I do CW show formats. I love the nerd culture jokes, and the relationship developments that feel like they're between adults and not aged up teenagers. \n\n\nIt saddens me that SHIELD is potentially on the chopping block when it has been consistently good (not always great), and usually there is an episode that really ties up previous episodes into a nicely woven narrative where things that seem like a waste are world or character building towards a usually great arc finale. And yet Arrow had two terrible seasons albeit season five is definitely much better although I don't know if it will ever soar as high as season two, but hey I guess it is good that they still have their jobs because realistically I wouldn't want any show to be cancelled and people to suffer consequences in their real lives. \n\n\nBack to SHIELD though I am fascinated at this multi-mini-arc thing they are doing in a season that builds on each other. I admit I didn't like LMD initially until probably the Koenig episode. And then I got into the groove and the finale paid off in spades. Not only in dialogue, but visually it is an ode to nerd culture. \n\n\nThe way Quake resembles Ellen Ripley in Alien while armed with a large weapon was awesome, and then her strength of character that evoked a sort of Sarah Connor from T2 was just an 80's treat. \n\n\nThe first season is tough, but it is world building and after episode 16 or 17 they really flip your switch. Although I would watch earlier episodes like FZZT where important relationships are formed and the seeds of future plans are sown and reaped much richer than just skipping a bunch of episodes, and eating your cake first.
