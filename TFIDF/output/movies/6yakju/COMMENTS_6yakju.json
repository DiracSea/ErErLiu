He was always very self-conscious of his smile, growing the mustache to hide his teeth, and intensely private, his stage persona becoming almost a split personality for him. Whether it bothers with his party life or explores his relationships and how they were affected by his party life is inconsequential next to why he chose those particular avenues. The most fascinating aspect of his life is that he left everything to his one-time girlfriend Mary Austin, a relationship that honestly deserves its own movie. He said she was the only person that ever really knew him. The evolution of their sound and the many different directions it took it is worth a look, but from Mercury's perspective and through Mercury's eyes. \n\nAlso, the name is rubbish.

When the reality of that is certainly not the case.\n\nI can't even imagine the struggles you went through trying to form your own identity when you had no representation to help you work out what was going on or to understand who you were. And like you said, even in shows etc that had gay characters, bisexuality is usually only referred to as being \"a phase\" someone had at some point in their lives, which is ridiculous.\n\nI live in Australia and we're currently about to have a postal vote on the topic of same sex marriage. I am all for it, but the postal vote has been an awful way to go about it. It's given idiots a platform to spew their hatred. And even sensible people who I would think would support it have been making idiotic statements like \"why does it have to be marriage, why not a civil union\". I hate to think of the effect that this is having on the younger generations who are struggling with their identity. Love is love, why is that so hard to understand? The government has no right to state how two consenting adults who want to spend their lives together are able to do so. It's utter nonsense. \n\nI am thrilled to hear that you have found your identity and I hope that things like this film will portray Freddie as a role model for those who are in a similar situation to how you once were. He was loved because of who he was and what he did, not because of who he loved. And it was a time where the LGBT+ community weren't as accepted and must have been incredibly difficult for him, especially being in the spotlight as he was.\n\nI can't imagine the struggles you have been through. I never had to come out to my family or anyone else as straight so I find it absurd that anyone else has to. Once would be difficult, so I cant even imagine how hard twice must have been. But it sounds like they love you for you which is incredibly important for your own sense of self and happiness. But it's also people like you that have paved the way for the younger generation to find their identity and love themselves for it. As I said earlier, love is love.\n\nAs a brown person it means a lot to me that people like me are represented in society and in the media now as they never were when I was growing up and I struggled with who I was because of that. I think it's equally as important for all 'minorities' in society to have representation. But I truely hope they use this opportunity to tell his story to those who don't know it. I know and like queen and I didn't know he was bisexual. So let's shout it to the world and give you the representation you very clearly deserve in the world.\n\nKeep on keeping on my friend \ud83d\udc95\n\nEdit - I tried to stop my rambling.
