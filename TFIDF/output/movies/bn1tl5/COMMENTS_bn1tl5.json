There was only one other couple in the theater. For the first few minutes I was convinced it was troll from Cohen since they were both in theaters at the same time. \n\nThe guy in the other couple left and came back after about 10 minutes, presumably to check what was labeled as playing outside the theater door, which inspired me to do the same. We scratched our heads about it and walked in together, and told our partners we were in the right theater, it\u2019s just the wrong movie. \n\nI originally thought The Informant! looked boring, but by this point I was enjoying it a lot. I asked my girlfriend if I should tell an attendant and she said she was actually pretty interested in finishing the movie. The other guy returned to his seat and presumably had the same conversation because they didn\u2019t get up either. \n\nAbout 30 minutes in a theater employee asked us if this was the right movie, and the other couple looked back at us as if to gauge our opinion and replied that it wasn\u2019t but they were happy to watch it. I agreed and asked them to leave it. \n\nUnfortunately, they weren\u2019t able to do that for whatever reason, but also said they wouldn\u2019t have time before the next showing to start the correct movie so late. She brought us out of the theater and to the service desk where she said we\u2019d have to be refunded or accept free movie passes. \n\nAll four of us accepted passes and got tickets to the next showing of The Informant!\n\n**TL;DR:** Tried to watch a Sacha Baron Cohen movie in a theater with only one other couple, but they showed The Informant! instead. We all agreed to leave it because we were enjoying the movie, but they made us leave and gave us ticket vouchers, which we all used to get tickets for the next showing of The Informant!  \n\nAlso, in my more rebellious phase, my friend and I pulled a double feature and snuck into Argo after seeing something else. They showed Taken 2 instead. We were the only people in the theater, and we didn\u2019t have tickets, so we couldn\u2019t complain.

I was projectionist/projection manager too back in the day for a few years.\n\nThe big problem was that the films came to us completely random. Some were wound beginning to end (head to tails) and others came end to beginning. (tails to head) NONE of the damn things were consistent. So for example reels 1,4 and 6 would be backwards. Had to rewind it first and then splice the reels together. Easy to mix up at midnight when you have to built 4-6 prints of a show(s) while also having to show up 10am the next day making minimum wage...\n\nIts also easy to screw up splices when the beginning or end of the reel is a fade in or out to black and you cant find the frame lines because the entire thing is black. Honestly.. what fool came up with that?\n\nThe worst accident was Saving Private Ryan. We had to transport the film, still built, to another sister theater down the road. As we were carrying it up the stairs we had to tilt it slightly sideways to get it to fit. The center fell out and we had half the first reel in a ball on the floor. Wasn't fun to fix that one working from the center back inwards.\n\nGood times though. Still one of my fav jobs. This was back when we were allowed to put on any trailers we wanted and had in our inventory. (obviously kids movie trailers for kids movies, horror trailers for  horror movies etc) So it was a blast creating trailer rings of 4-5 of the best trailers. Back when we didnt have to deal with these crap ads. No more than 10 minutes of trailers only and then movie. Done.\n\nTeasing people coming only to watch the Episode 1 trailer by showing the Austin Powers spoof star wars trailer first was fun. So many people thought it was the real trailer at first.. you could hear the entire audience get hyped and then collectively sigh every time... but they were happy at the end because hey it was Austin Powers. Then I show the actual trailer and everyone is happy.\n\n[Austin Powers -The Spy Who Shagged Me](https://youtu.be/mYVb4OLk4NQ)\n\nanyways...\n\nJump ahead and Im also now in the film industry too because of it. 11 years VFX on the good stuff.

Sometimes a speaker or two would blow and throw things off too. We had some auditoriums with DTS sound system (sound came on a CD) but if the cd player broke it reverted to default stereo which is not loud. So you would adjust for that. Then the disc would kick in randomly and blow everyones ears out. (sorry.. those things were shit at times)  \n\n\nWe literally only had a volume dial. Sometimes managers would watch a film the night before after work and would crank the sound. Sometimes managers had friends show up who wanted it nice and loud and they would accommodate. But then never turn it back down. Sometimes you play different movies in the same auditorium at different times a day and you have to adjust for each one. But no one remembers to do that all the time.  \n\n\nIts a weird balancing act. And typically only a few of the projectionists even really cared.  \n\n\nI liked to play films as loud as possibly (good loud not bad loud) because it gave a more intense experience. The equivalent of going to an IMAX screen vs the theater down the road thats 50 years old.   \n\n\nThe Pod Race in Ep1 I would crank up just slightly more and then back down once it was over. You could feel the bass even outside the auditorium. Rarely did anyone complain bout it, but when they did we were happy to turn it down. (and then turn it back up on the next showing)  \n\n\nBut again... not painfully loud. But awesome loud. And I came from a THX certified theater where sound was always a priority. Nothing worse than going to a theater and feeling underwhelmed simply because the lazy ass in the booth doesnt care about providing an amazing film going experience.  \n\n\nIve worked in big theaters were the sound was so different from one screen to the other playing the exact same movie.
