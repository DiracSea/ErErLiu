[{"body": "Since we are getting a lot of /r/HailCorporate love I just wanted to point out the biggest drawback to this price change. Here's an article from Bloomberg: \n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-15/netflix-co-founder-s-crazy-plan-pay-10-a-month-go-to-the-movies-all-you-want\n\nRelevant paragraph: \n\n>MoviePass could lose a lot of money subsidizing people\u2019s movie habits. So the company also raised cash on Tuesday by selling a majority stake to Helios and Matheson Analytics Inc., a small, publicly traded data firm in New York. The companies declined to comment on terms of the financing but said MoviePass intends to hold an initial public offering by March. Helios and Metheson shares rose 8 percent to $3.01 at 2 p.m. in New York.\n\n>Ted Farnsworth, chief executive officer at Helios and Matheson, said the goal is to amass a large base of customers and collect data on viewing behaviors. That information could then be used to eventually target advertisements or other marketing materials to subscribers. \u201cIt\u2019s no different than Facebook or Google,\u201d Farnsworth said. \u201cThe more we understand our fans, the more we can target them.\u201d\n\nSo for the cheaper price you should know you are sacrificing  your movie watching habits to public data trading. \n\nAlso as a MoviePass user here's some stuff you should know about the app:\n\n* You can only see one film per day\n\n* You can only see a film once (**edit:** sounds like that rule may change: https://twitter.com/MoviePass/status/897439572526862337)\n\n* You can't use it for IMAX or 3D\n\n* The feature has recently went away but for a while you had to take a picture of your ticket to prove you paid for the film you said you were going to see\n\n* The app can often be buggy and not have the proper film listings or they may not show up at all\n\n* If you go to a theater that has seating reservations you can't order them online, you have to be in person in theater to buy your tickets. \n\nI sill plan to use MoviePass but I want people to be clear that there is no such thing as a golden ticket in the world of corporate moviegoing. \n", "created_utc": 1502827107.0, "distinguished": "moderator", "edited": 1502828648.0, "id": "dlo37qk", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6ttrnq", "parent_id": "t3_6ttrnq", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6ttrnq/moviepass_a_subscription_plan_that_lets_you_go_to/dlo37qk/", "score": 1, "stickied": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "mi-16evil", "author_id": "4vrqm", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "For those having a hard time loading the blog:\n\n>Dear MoviePass Community,\n\n>For the last several years, we have been testing a number of service offers and price points. We have learned a lot during this process and believe that we now have an offer that can\u2019t be beat.\n\n>Effective today, we are introducing a universal subscription plan for $9.95 per month. MoviePass will have one price point nationwide and it will be for standard 2D films only. As a subscriber, you can see any movie, at any theater, at any time. For your convenience, we currently support more than 91 percent of movie theaters nationwide. Unfortunately, premium formats such as 3D and IMAX will not be included in this plan.\n\n>We believe that you want to see more movies in theaters. Our $9.95 per month subscription makes it possible for you to see a movie every day, if you would like.\n\n>For current members, your price will automatically be reduced to $9.95, beginning on your next billing cycle following August 15th.  \n\n>As before, there is no contract, so you are free to cancel at any time. This price point will be guaranteed for at least 12 months for those who sign up during this period.  Space is limited.\n\n>To all of those members who have supported us over the years, thank you!

Several instances of severely drunk people either starting fights with other people in the audience or, on a couple of occasions, with the characters on the screen. I've seen people forcibly removed by the police from three different theaters in SF. By the way, if you try to say anything to any of these people, you're risking a physical altercation.

You find the theater you're at on the app (which will show up automatically based on your entered zip code and/or location), you \"check in\" to the movie time you're going to (the app looks like fandango), and you'll get a conformation immediately. You can now use your card at the theaters kiosk or box office to purchase the ticket (checking into the movie on the app loads the card with the money to by the ticket. So the card otherwise has no balance. And you can't check in without being in or at least close to the theater, since the app accounts for your location).\n\n\nThat's it.

It's happened for the last three a24 release for example, where they'll take over a week after they release to finally show up. Good Time still isn't showing up on the app despite coming out Friday. The work around is checking in to the movie through the costumer service chat on the app.\n\n* Four times in the three years that I've used it, the app freezes in some way: the check in process never completes, or no theaters or movies show up. Luckily, again, you can just check in to the movie through the costumer service chat. The app is always fine the next time I use it.\n\n* And lastly, this news seems to have crashed their servers, since the app wouldn't load at all for the movie I just saw, and their customer service is so swamped I couldn't have them check me in on their end.
