Of course I know some of the questions that come up a lot \u2013 \u201cWasn\u2019t there a lot more pressure dealing with the sequel of a beloved film?\u201d (No, there was less, because this time I knew there was an audience waiting to see it!) and, \u201cWhat was it like working with Kurt Russell and Sylvester Stallone?\u201d (Daunting and at times overwhelming \u2013 I ran around in my backyard as a kid pretending to be Snake Plissken and John Rambo, so these guys are true icons to me.)\n\n>But the question that comes up perhaps the most is, \u201cWhat\u2019s the deal with Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, and are you going to direct?\u201d\n\n> Before I was able to honestly answer this, I needed to know it was, in my heart, what I truly felt called to do. There is a history in Hollywood of haphazard endings to trilogies, and I didn\u2019t want to become a part of that dishonorable tradition of pretending the third one doesn\u2019t exist. I couldn\u2019t do it for the money, and I couldn\u2019t do it because it was what other people wanted me to do. I needed to do it because it was what I needed to do. I have never made choices in my career based on anything other than passion and love for the stories and characters, and I didn\u2019t want to start now.\n\n> So, after many months of ruminations and discussions, I know the answer. I could save this answer for the first, random interviewer to ask me during the press junket but instead I thought I\u2019d share it with the most important people in the Guardiansverse \u2013 you, the fans, who have been so incredibly supportive and enthusiastic over the past five years, it has moved me to tears on a regular basis.\n\n>So, yes, I\u2019m returning to write and direct Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.\n\n>In the end, my love for Rocket, Groot, Gamora, Star-Lord, Yondu, Mantis, Drax, and Nebula \u2013 and some of the other forthcoming heroes \u2013 goes deeper than you guys can possibly imagine, and I feel they have more adventures to go on and things to learn about themselves and the wonderful and sometimes terrifying universe we all inhabit. And, like in both Vol. 1 and Vol. 2, we will work on creating the story that goes beyond what you expect.\n\n>My partnership with the folks at Marvel Studios \u2013 Kevin Feige, Lou D\u2019Esposito, Victoria Alonso, and Jonathan Schwartz \u2013 has been the best of my professional career, and is a huge contributing factor to my decision \u2013 as is my relationship to the guys at Disney Studios \u2013 Bob Iger, Alan Horn, and Alan Bergman \u2013 who have been cheerleading innovation and the pure love of movies from the start. This is the kind of thing you\u2019d expect a director to say about the people who have just hired him, but people who know me know I would never put up working with people I don\u2019t like for a single movie, much less two, and much, much less three. I love them all and appreciate immensely their collaboration. I wake up every day pinching myself that they\u2019d allow this punk rock kid from Missouri to help create this wonderful universe, and to not only allow but encourage creative freedom while doing so.\n\n>I can\u2019t fricking wait to get started.\n\n>Much of what\u2019s happened in the MCU for the past ten or so years has been leading, in a big way, to the Avengers\u2019 Infinity War. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 will happen after all that. It will conclude the story of this iteration of the Guardians of the Galaxy, and help catapult both old and new Marvel characters into the next ten years and beyond. I will be working side-by-side with Kevin Feige and the gang to help design where these stories go, and make sure the future of the Marvel Cosmic Universe is as special and authentic and magical as what we have created so far.\n\n>I promise you, the fans, I\u2019ll do it all with integrity and love and respect for the characters.\n\n>Make mine Marvel.\n\n>We are Groot.\n\n>Excelsior!\n\n>Love,  \nJames", "created_utc": 1492457677.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dgdzjte", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_65xmto", "parent_id": "t3_65xmto", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/65xmto/james_gunn_will_return_to_write_and_direct/dgdzjte/", "score": 387, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "johncosta", "author_id": "5i21l", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I think that Gunn is more important to the Guardians franchise than any other director is to their respective property.

Like it's a bit more creative but still, Cloud Galactusammu. \n\nI still don't understand why they made Cumberbatch speak in an American accent. Surely in an American setting it would make sense to have him sound himself and how alone he is with that accent and then the fact people in wherever he trained (see, it's just not memorable so I don't remember it) spoke in an English accent hints at him belonging there. Not to say English accents make people outsiders, just that the temple place is dominated with English accents in the main characters there so when we'd see Strange in this setting his English accent would now blend in rather than stand out like in the New York setting. Plus it's just jarring hearing a fake accent on him when he has such a recognisable voice, especially when the accent he's doing is the generic American accent that everyone who isn't American tries to do. \n", "created_utc": 1492466375.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1492528071.0, "id": "dge72fs", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_65xmto", "parent_id": "t1_dge6c34", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/65xmto/james_gunn_will_return_to_write_and_direct/dge72fs/", "score": 37, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "TheJoshider10", "author_id": "f0uld", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I liked almost everything about Logan.
