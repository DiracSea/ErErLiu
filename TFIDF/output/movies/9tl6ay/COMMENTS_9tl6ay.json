The surface beneath her bare back and legs is firm, clayey, dry. The distant thunder of the water is drowsy, soothing. She reaches for him. There is a moment when her father intervenes, harsh and forbidding, and then she closes her arms around Eddie\u2019s neck, her smooth cheek against his smooth cheek, and as he tentatively touches her small breasts she sighs and thinks for the first time, This is Eddie, and she remembers a day in July \u2014 could it only have been last month? \u2014 when no one else turned up in the Barrens but Eddie, and he had a whole bunch of little Lulu comic books and they read together for most of the afternoon, Little Lulu looking for beebleberries and getting in all sorts of crazy situations. It had been fun.\n\n>She thinks of birds; in particular of the grackles and starlings and crows that come back in the spring, and her hands go to his belt and loosen it, and he says again that he can\u2019t do that; she tells him that he can , she knows he can, and what she feels is not shame or fear now but a kind of triumph. \n\n>\u201cWhere?\u201d he says, and that hard thing pushes urgently against her inner thigh.\n\n>\u201cHere,\u201d she says.\n\n>\u201cBevvie, I\u2019ll fall on you!\u201d he says, and she hears his breath start to whistle painfully.\n\n>\u201cI think that\u2019s sort of the idea,\u201d she tells him and holds him gently and guides him. He pushes forward too fast and there is pain.\n\n>Ssssss! \u2014 she draws her breath in, her teeth biting at her lower lip and thinks of all the birds again, the spring birds, lining the roofpeaks of houses, taking wing all at once under low March clouds.\n\n>\u201cBeverly?\u201d he says uncertainly. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n\n>\u201cGo slower,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019ll be easier for you to breathe.\u201d He does move more slowly, and after a while his breathing speeds up but she understands this is not because there is anything wrong with him.\n\n>The pain fades. Suddenly he moves more quickly, then stops, stiffens, and makes a sound \u2014 some sound. She senses that this is something for him, something extraordinarily, special, something like\u2026 like flying. She feels powerful: she feels a sense of triumph rise up strongly within her. Is this what her father was afraid of? Well he might be! There was power in this act, all right, a chain-breaking power that was blood-deep. She feels no physical pleasure, but there is a kind of mental ecstasy in it for her. She senses the closeness. He puts his face against her neck and she holds him. He is crying. She holds him. And feels the part of him that made a connection between them begin to fade.
