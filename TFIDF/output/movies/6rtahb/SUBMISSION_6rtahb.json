Wolf made close to 400 million and The Revenant made more than 500 million at the BO. Gatsby finished with 350 million, and his presence certainly helped Django make more than 400 million. These are the sort of films that dont really make that kind of money,yet all these films are very successful considering they are more or less serious dramas. Other movie star who previously refrained from franchises, have all joined them. It is not wrong to do so, but these are safer bets as compared to original movies.Washington is also in this category now as he is doing Equalizer 2. \n\nTherefore, I feel Dicaprio deserves credit for making a big name for himself while doing original films every time. And he has a great filmography as well.", "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "title": "Leonardo Dicaprio is perhaps the only major movie star left with no franchise film.", "url": null, "author_name": "Boss452", "author_id": "4u13jba", "subreddit_name": "movies", "upvote_ratio": 0.84}
