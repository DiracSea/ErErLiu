[{"body": "A few years ago my husband and I went to go see the Lion King when it was doing a special showing. Well, the movie starts and there is no sound. That goes on for like ten minutes, before I turn to my husband and ask \"should we go tell someone\". SOMEONE SHUSHED ME. There was like maybe five other people in the theater, so it wasn't hard to distinguish who did it. I turned around, stared at her like the idiot she was (she was avoiding eye contact so I couldn't stare into her soul) and said \"really?\". Eventually the sound came on, I was still annoyed cause we missed the circle of life :( EDIT: I got a bunch of replies asking why nobody got up sooner, especially for such an important scene in one of the greatest movies of all time. I can't speak for everyone, but for me it was mostly due to an assumption that they knew there was a problem and were trying to fix it, they would restart the movie when it was fixed, and I really didn't want to get up and talk to anyone.  So yeah, mistakes were made that day. The sound came on almost immediately after I really'd shush girl. I don't remember how long exactly, but I remember it was while I was still trying to figure out why someone would shush someone in a movie with no goddamn sound.", "created_utc": 1522643185.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1522681107.0, "id": "dwnsvmo", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_88urzc", "parent_id": "t3_88urzc", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/88urzc/i_got_chastised_for_being_on_my_cell_phone_before/dwnsvmo/", "score": 8066, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "butt-queef", "author_id": "nmng4", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I pulled my phone out during the \"Silence Your Cell Phones\" reminder, specifically to silence my phone, it is a reminder after all.

I showed up about 20 minutes early, browsed my phone and listened to music during the Maria Menounos pre-preview commercials. By the time previews started and my phone went away, two loud obnoxious people sat behind me. They loudly \"whispered\", if you can even call it that,  through all the previews. I was thinking \"oh great, I'm stuck in front of two teenage girls.\" I was starting to get worried, but thought I'd wait and hope they were considerate enough to shut up when the actual movie started.... nope. They continued talking through the entire movie, ignoring plenty of shushes from me throughout.  \n  \nCredits roll around, and they still haven't stopped talking. I'm fairly annoyed at this point, not only because of the talking, but because one of them was completely unable to recognise characters and would constantly ask who people were, sometimes multiple times in the same scene. But the moment in their conversation that made me lose my shit was when (spoiler) shows up during the post credit scene and the really dumb girl says \"OH MY GOD, IT'S DEADPOOL! I TOLD YOU HE'D BE IN THIS\". That sentence, for whatever reason, motivated me to turn around and curse these teens out, except they weren't teens, but a mother and her 12ish year old son.\n  \nThe conversation went like this:  \n  \nMe: Can you please shut the fuck up for 30 seconds? You've been talking the whole movie!  \n  \nWoman: Excuse me? You a child, and you show me respect!  \n  \nM: Oh, like the respect you showed to everyone else in the fucking theater when you couldn't be quiet?  \n  \nW: You think you can cuss at me?  You a child who needs to respect adults. You parents failed at raising you.  \n  \nM: Ma'am, I'm an adult too but my parents did fine raising me. They at least taught me to be respectful at the movies and be quiet, unlike you.  \n  \nW: I'm going to get the manager!  \n  \nM: Don't worry about it, stay here and keep talking, I'll go get him.  \n  \nWe both leave to get the manager. In the hallway to the lobby, it continues.  \n  \nW: I can't believe it! I spent good, hard earned money on these tickets only to be cursed at by a no-respect child!   \n  \nM: I paid $9 dollars for my ticket too, as did everyone else in the theater. We all paid to see the movie, not get your fucking commentary with it!\n  \nManager hears problem.  \n  \nManager: Is there a problem here?\n\nMe: Yeah, this woman wouldn't stop talking through the movie.   \n  \nWoman (in background through the entire conversation): He needs respect! He is a child, and he cussed at me!\n\nManager: How bad was her talking?  \n  \nMe: Full volume through the entire film, with at the most, 15 seconds of silence between her talking.  \n  \nManager: Did you swear at her?  \n  \nMe: Yeah, and I probably shouldn't have, but I'm a bit pissed after 2 hours of her commentary. \n  \nWoman: He admitted it! Ban him! I want a full refund!  \n  \nManager: Hold on, I'll deal with you in a moment. (To me) Sorry about all this.\n\nI shake his hand and leave, all while she's still complaining.  \n  \nI went back to that theater to see The Last Jedi a couple weeks later, and the manager recognised me, gave me a discount on the ticket, and told me how that woman freaked out at him after I left, so he banned her. \n  \nHoly shit, this became a really long story, I'm sorry.  \n  \nTL;DR: Saw Justice League, and ended up in a swear filled fight with a loud mother.

You can tell if a kid is enjoying something or if they are upset, and one kid definitely was upset. I've seen enough bullying to know when I see it.\n\nSo I looked at it for a while from afar and was wondering if should be stopped, and it really looked like it should. Other adults just walked past and didn't care at all - I'm guessing because the kids were immigrants.\n\nSuch indifference pissed me off because adults should stop little kids from doing stupid shit like that, their kids or not, yet no one was doing anything. And bullying or not, it was super rowdy and loud and not of proper manners. So I stormed off before my gf even realized what I was doing.\n\nWhen I got there I said something along the lines \"Hey! Stop it! This isn't a place for fighting\". Which was silly, no place is a place for fighting, especially when it looked like bullying. One kid, who I knew was the main bully in the situation, explained very confrontionally that they were just playing, to which I replied \"if you are gonna continue fighting you can fuck off\". To little 12 year old kids.\n\nI felt and still feel bad for handling it like that. I was supposed to be the adult and in control of the situation, but I was legit mad about no one stopping the bullying so I cursed at little kids instead of thinking about what I should say.\n\nNot that related but kinda. Should have said something very different. I handled it so bad I cringe every time. Extra cringe because I'm a student teacher and generally good with kids.
