What is your character good at, comfortable with? Throw the polar opposite at them. Challenge them. How do they deal?\n>7. Come up with your ending before you figure out your middle. Seriously. Endings are hard, get yours working up front.\n\nAfter 15 years, the writers knew well how toys think. Following these two rules above, I can picture them thinking: \"We love these characters. We want to create the best possible story, to pull out all the stops, to make it so we can say and do absolutely everything for them that can be said or done, to create the most complete and satisfying end so that we can be happy to close the story. So... what is the worst possible final scenario for a toy? What is the best? How can we take them from the worst to the best and finish this story once and for all.\"\n\nAnd they did. What is the worst possible ending for a toy? Worse than ending up in the hands of the masochistic kid next door? Worse than retiring into a museum for eternity? Worse than being tortured by toddlers? What is hell for a toy? How about being burned in a massive incinerator as an abandoned and unloved toy... Yeah, that'll do...\n\nHow about the best possible ending... What is better than sitting in the attic of the boy you love? What is better than going with him to college as a keepsake: around but never actually played with? What is better than retiring to a daycare where you get played with, but the children don't know you or remember you? How about being given a new life, resetting the clock, and being passed from one beloved owner to a little girl who still has a decade to play with you, pretend with you and love you... Yeah, that'll do too...\n\nNow, to top it all off, to make this transition as sublime for our beloved toys as we can, we'll have Andy take out one whole afternoon from his busy college-bound schedule to introduce them to this girl. Then he'll give them the perfect send off... the thing these toys have wanted more than anything for the years they've been waiting in his toy box... he'll play with them... one. last. time. And then he will say good bye. And then they will be Bonnie's. And they will be played with and loved every day all over again... Yeah, that'll do...\n\nDamn, I get emotional just thinking about it again. Absolutely.

There is one more send off that *was not* explored. The actual *death* of a Toy. Yes, they explored some possible \u201cafterlives\u201d but not a single time was a toys death explored. Clearly, this is exploring the birth of a toy, and I expect the ending to be Bo Peep (a porcelain doll) breaking, to be the exploration of a toys death.\n\nAlso, why do you want it to end anyways? \u201cIt was the perfect ending!\u201d Is a weak reason if you admit they\u2019ve been able to do themselves again when you though they did it perfectly before. You grew up with the characters clearly, yet you reject the notion that maybe you could continue to grow up with them...because your afraid it will undermine the previous film?\n\nHow could it? The 3rd film\u2019s \u201cending\u201d wasn\u2019t so much of an ending as it was a new beginning. In fact there was a theme of \u201cleaving things unfinished\u201d throughout the film, such as with *not killing the toys*, not going after Lotso, and other such things. \n\nPlus, you probably also forgot that in the time between 3 and 4 we got 3 shorts and 2 TV specials that continue the story, without undermining the 3rd film. That\u2019s about 66 minutes  (three 7 or so minute shorts, and two 22 minute specials) (closer to 70 if we include the epilogue of 3) which in and of itself is 4 minutes shorter than the 1st film! Meaning *we\u2019ve already gotten close to a whole movie\u2019s worth of time with the toys after 3*! What difference does it make if they make a new film!\n\nFinally, I\u2019ll argue that the *entire* message of the 3rd film is undermined by the lack of a sequel film. (Yes, really.) Because I feel like the film is misunderstood a lot. It isn\u2019t really about \u201cendings\u201d (like I\u2019ve said previously) but new beginnings. The misunderstanding stems from the fact that throughout the film, the toys do in fact believe that this is the end of their lives. They believe that Andy going to college is the end-all-be-all of their lives. \n\n...and yet, they learn over the course of the film that sometimes when you think something (particularly anything regarding change) is going to be \u201cthe end of the world.\u201d It winds up being just another step in life, a new beginning.\n\nSo, if Pixar ignores the message and says \u201cToy Story 3 was the ending.\u201d Which to my knowledge they never actually did...doesn\u2019t that undermine the \u201cchange is something that we should accept\u201d message? \n\n", "created_utc": 1542033122.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e9jyn7q", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_9wdt6e", "parent_id": "t1_e9jw8p2", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/9wdt6e/toy_story_4_official_teaser/e9jyn7q/", "score": 51, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "naynaythewonderhorse", "author_id": "dnybq", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "That TS3 ending was perfect. \n\nI\u2019m still excited for TS4, though.
