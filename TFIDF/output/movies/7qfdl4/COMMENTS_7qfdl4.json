Prior to this movie, I would've said there's no way a bunch of people could flat out fall asleep in a movie theater with how loud theater sound systems are, but this movie was boring enough that it put about half a dozen 18/19/20 year old guys and girls to sleep.\n\nI'm always surprised that people still remember and talk about it. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I can be a bit stuck up when it comes to comedies, but the fact that my friends fell asleep, too, was enough to know it wasn't just me this time.", "created_utc": 1515990308.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1515990503.0, "id": "dsp6qyj", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7qfdl4", "parent_id": "t1_dsp0z57", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7qfdl4/the_first_draft_of_anchorman_the_legend_of_ron/dsp6qyj/", "score": 1, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "FallingOffALog", "author_id": "jakwa", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "So random", "created_utc": 1515986245.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dsp3t2i", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7qfdl4", "parent_id": "t1_dsp3mno", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7qfdl4/the_first_draft_of_anchorman_the_legend_of_ron/dsp3t2i/", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "the_vault-technician", "author_id": "e8heg", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": ">9 year old boy would come up with.\n\nAnchorman rides a thin line, there\u2019s a reason this didn\u2019t make it.", "created_utc": 1516003382.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dspe4c7", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7qfdl4", "parent_id": "t1_dsp9zxu", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7qfdl4/the_first_draft_of_anchorman_the_legend_of_ron/dspe4c7/", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "SkullFiddle", "author_id": "y9vsx", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I'm Ron Burgundy?", "created_utc": 1515989212.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dsp5yro", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7qfdl4", "parent_id": "t1_dsp1ytj", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7qfdl4/the_first_draft_of_anchorman_the_legend_of_ron/dsp5yro/", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "vizualkriminal", "author_id": "hft0l", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I personally enjoyed it.
