Doing that short circuits some people's mind and I think it's easy to see why if you believe in law and the justice system as a principal. However, considering the fact that sexual assault and harassment often happen under circumstances where proof is near impossible, it would seem improbable to ever deal with sexual assault claims in a satisfactory manner, at least if satisfaction equals taking criminals off the street. Too often, I think people will see a criticism of the justice system and react as if that critic is implying that everyone involved is rotten to the core and needs to be shot. Reform is not revolution, after all. \n\nAt least, that's what I hope.
