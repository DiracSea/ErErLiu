As a location scout/asst location manager, I never had so much direct access to the director. It was a ton of fun and very rewarding.

Everyone seemed to love him, and we frequently had actors from his previous films (or people he was friends with) just come by for the experience. For example, I distinctly remember seeing Karen Allen one day and Thandie Newton (who was in his remake of Charade) on another occasion. As opposed to other directors/artists I've seen on set, Demme was the most down to earth, the most humble, and the most fun to be around.  The actors he worked with were fiercely loyal to him, and he used them on tons of his films (yes, Ted Levine, and yes, Roger Corman, but many, many others, too). He was just an awesome person to have lead a film production.\n\nJust a great man. So friendly. So approachable. A great artist. A humanitarian.

I remember watching both versions and getting goosebumps for different reasons. \n\nWhile the 60s version was more on mental manipulation and lust for power, Demme's version really doubles down on how war impacts soldiers, how veterans can fall through the cracks, how the lust for power destroys families, how fear against groups is introduced and used effectively to justify certain actions (look for the Private Eddie Ingram scene on YouTube, the movie's Desert Storm-set flashbacks give me nightmares to this day), and how war, money, and technology can make it easier to interfere in a state's affairs. \n\nHis version is even more overt and aggressive when it comes to the mother exerting control over the son, Raymond Prentiss. \n\nLansbury is the power-behind-the-throne type and operates on mystery, on people never catching on to her till late in the game.\n\nStreep's version is even more sinister because her actions are so overt but you don't realize everything is being coordinated and controlled around you until it's late--it's being controlling of his life and lovelife so he gets driven to enlist, orchestrating a scenario where he comes out the hero, getting people to rally behind him as VP, and activating the mind control chip. It's almost like she wants to be caught and wants to let you know how easy it is for someone as powerful as she is to get away with it. \n\nStreep also plays the mother with a more sexual edge, which makes her actions even more unsettling because it comes across as a reverse Oedipus. She literally has no boundaries. It's one of Streep's most compelling characters, and to this day, it amazes me that her role does not even register on most of these 'best Streep performances' lists.

No, if you'd made it up, it wouldn't sting. We were talking about transsexuals. You said violence and destructive aberrant behavior are not statistical correlatives of transsexualism. True.

Everything was stainless steel, the cup dispenser, the counter, the waste bin, the rims of Dr. Danielson's spectacles. The bright metal suggested the wink of instruments and gave Crawford a distinct twinge in the area of his inguinal ring.\n\n>He and the doctor were alone in the little galley.\n\n>\"Not without a court order, you don't,\" Dr. Danielson said again. He was brusque this time, to counter the hospitality he'd shown with the coffee.\n\n>Danielson was head of the Gender Identity Clinic at Johns Hopkins and he had agreed to meet Crawford at first light, long before morning rounds. \"You'll have to show me a separate court order for each specific case and we'll fight every one. What did Columbus and Minnesota tell you-- same thing, am I right?\"\n\n>\"The Justice Department's asking them right now. We have to do this fast, Doctor. If the girl's not dead already, he'll kill her soon-- tonight or tomorrow. Then he'll pick the next one,\" Crawford said.\n\n>\"To even mention Buffalo Bill in the same breath with the problems we treat here is ignorant and unfair and dangerous, Mr. Crawford. It makes my hair stand on end. It's taken years-- we're not through yet-- showing the public that transsexuals aren't crazy, they aren't perverts, they aren't queers, whatever that is--\"\n\n>\"I agree with you--\"\n\n>\"Hold on.

We start shooting them from the left side of the table. Our line is established. We can move the camera wherever we want but it will always stay on the left of the line. Let's say for simplicity our camera will be locked down at an equal distance between the two while being on the left of the line. \n\nWe rotate the camera left to shoot actor A. He will be framed so he is more on the left hand side of the frame with more open space to the right where he is looking. That's called lead room. So, we shoot his talking. Now we rotate the camera to the right to film actor B. Remember, the camera is still on the left of the line. When we rotate to actor B he will be framed on the right side of the frame with his lead room to the left. So basically as we cut back and forth you get:\n\nActor A: on left\nActor B: on right\nActor A: on left\nActor B: on right \n\nThis makes sense to the human eye. Go ahead, watch a conversation scene with two characters in a movie. They always stay on their side once established and the camera always stays on that side of the line. This even holds true in scenes over an actors shoulder at the other one. Using the above example we can show actor A on the left hand side of the frame then actor b on the right side. Now we cut in to over the shoulder shots but we stay on the correct side of the line. If we're looking at actor A he's on the left of the screen with actor Bs shoulder on the right. If we're looking at actor B, he is on the right with Actor As shoulder on the left. \n\nYou never can move to the other side of that line unless... 1. You move the camera during a shot. So if we are over As shoulder looking at B who's on the right and then as they talk the camera dollys to the left until As shoulder is on the right and B is on the left. Now we are on the other side of the line, it won't disorient the audience and they've switched sides of the frame. 2nd Time to Move Over the Line: to create an intentionally jarring image or eeriness about the image. People seeing a line break may not know why they feel uncomfortable but they will feel uncomfortable which is why Silence of the Lambs used this to such great effect.

No, if you'd made it up, it wouldn't sting. We were talking about transsexuals. You said violence and destructive aberrant behavior are not statistical correlatives of transsexualism. True.

I wouldn't be surprised if he's applied for sex reassignment at one or all of them and been denied.\"\n\nFurthermore, there is a deleted scene for as to why Bill was turned away from the programmes: Bill was declined due to his psych assessment, because he had already murdered his grandparents and spent time in juvenile detention for the crime.\n\nIn addition there is a section were Crawford himself goes to Johns Hopkins and interviews a doctor:\n\n>Jack Crawford declined Dr. Danielson's coffee, but took the cup to mix himself an Alka-Seltzer at the stainless-steel sink behind the nursing station. Everything was stainless steel, the cup dispenser, the counter, the waste bin, the rims of Dr. Danielson's spectacles. The bright metal suggested the wink of instruments and gave Crawford a distinct twinge in the area of his inguinal ring.\n\n>He and the doctor were alone in the little galley.\n\n>\"Not without a court order, you don't,\" Dr. Danielson said again. He was brusque this time, to counter the hospitality he'd shown with the coffee.\n\n>Danielson was head of the Gender Identity Clinic at Johns Hopkins and he had agreed to meet Crawford at first light, long before morning rounds. \"You'll have to show me a separate court order for each specific case and we'll fight every one. What did Columbus and Minnesota tell you-- same thing, am I right?\"\n\n>\"The Justice Department's asking them right now. We have to do this fast, Doctor. If the girl's not dead already, he'll kill her soon-- tonight or tomorrow. Then he'll pick the next one,\" Crawford said.\n\n>\"To even mention Buffalo Bill in the same breath with the problems we treat here is ignorant and unfair and dangerous, Mr. Crawford. It makes my hair stand on end. It's taken years-- we're not through yet-- showing the public that transsexuals aren't crazy, they aren't perverts, they aren't queers, whatever that is--\"\n\n>\"I agree with you--\"\n\n>\"Hold on. The incidence of violence among transsexuals is a lot lower than in the general population. These are decent people with a real problem-- a famously intransigent problem. They deserve help and we can give it. I'm not having a witch hunt here. We've never violated a patient's confidence, and we never will. Better start from there, Mr. Crawford.\"\n\nThomas Harris, the author of the book, was an notable and esteemed crime journalist and had much more then a layman's grasp of psychology - notable at the time.
