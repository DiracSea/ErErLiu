But he's got such a sense of responsibility that he barely juggles everything. \n\nEdit: thanks, but I am aware of his new life in ANAD, I just absolutely despise the new direction they took him. His whole history had been the above, the rich thing is basically a knockoff Iron Man. I don't care if the Zodiacs took his wrist computer, Spider-Man is his bodyguard. It's all stupid to me. \n\nEdit: yes, I read superior Spider-Man. What makes Spider-Man different to me is his morals and problems. I think a Spidey on top of everything is a boring character. \n\nHe's relatable! His life is a mess. He's got money problems. He's empathetic but with very little resources to actually help people. Take away his challenges and he's just another character to me. \n\nFinal edit: anyone who says I'm afraid of change ignores Renew Your Vows.
