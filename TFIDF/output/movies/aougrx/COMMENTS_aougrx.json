I have a high end film scanner and I should make my friends pay for the time that goes into running it, but I love seeing the old memories flow out and the joy that it brings to see them reborn. I'm betting that's how Peter Jackson feels about the project.  \n\nEDIT: Got some questions on film scanning PMed to me. I wrote my non-expert thoughts on the matter. \n\n###Mail Order\nwww.scancafe.com is one of the largest and cheapest options, but they send your photos to India. They do have US based scan options if you don't want to ship your images that far (if you're in the US)\n\nwww.digmypics.com is another large service and from what I've seen generally higher quality. They're based in Arizona and are a tad more expensive.\n\nThere's also some roundups on these services by [Wirecutter](https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/the-best-photo-scanning-service/) and [PCWorld](https://www.pcworld.com/article/2000199/the-best-and-worst-services-for-digitizing-your-photos.html).\n\nMost of these can do slides and 8mm film. You can also do some searches locally for labs near you. There's really not that many manufacturers of film scanners so most labs are using equipment from Noritsu, Fuji, and Nikon or some combination thereof. You're paying for the skill of the scanner operator, how they'll treat your film, what resolution they'll scan at (higher res gets slow), and how much work they'll put into color correcting the images.\n\nAlways look for a section on their webpage describing the equipment and techniques they'll use on your images. Any scan service worth their salt details this process.\n\nDon't use Walgreens, Costco, or other big box store service. They're cheap and the quality of their results are pretty bleh.\n\n###Buying a Scanner and DIY\nCheck out www.filmscanner.info/en for reviews on various film scanners currently available.\n\nFlatbed scanners like the Epson V600, Canoscan 9000F, and their numerous relatives are cheap provide reasonable quality. Look for Digital ICE technology which uses an IR scan to find and remove dust automagically (most high end film scanners listed below have this or similar dust removal features too). Flatbeds don't usually do that well with 35mm and can have odd color correction unless you're using 3rd party software like [Silverfast](https://www.silverfast.com/) or [VueScan](https://www.hamrick.com/). You can also get better results by using better [3rd party film holders](http://www.betterscanning.com/). They're also very slow. If you got a lot of slides you might go insane.\n\nThere are cheap scanners you'll find on Amazon from Wolverine, Jumbl, Kodak (not Kodak but shitty C+A Global licencing deal) and others. I bought one out of curiosity one time. They're using very cheap cameras with very cheap optics and chintzy upscaling to fool clueless consumers into thinking they're getting a deal. Seriously, a 2 megapixel scan from Walgreens showed better detail, color, and dynamic range than the \"22 Megapixel\" scans from the Jumbl scanner I tried. DO NOT use these.\n\nThere are several companies like Reflecta, Braun, and Plustek that make decent contemporary scanners. I haven't tried these but from what I've seen results can be very decent. They tend to be slow and need a bit of fiddling to get the colors looking right.\n\nFor mass slide scanning Braun makes the Multimag Slidescan 7000. There's also a 4000, 6000, and X version of this and a version marketed by Reflecta. Results look good and it can do mass amounts of slides by itself as long as you keep it loaded. Pricing on it is all over the place. I've seen it as low as 1000 USD, and over 3000 USD.\n\nCanon and Nikon made consumer scanners back in the day under Canoscan and Coolscan names. Despite being long discontinued, Nikon's Coolscan 5000 and 9000 are especially viewed as a benchmark for quality. They're not that fast though. The 5000 has the SF-210 attachment to do mass slide scanning, but it usually costs more than the scanner itself, easily gets jammed with some slides, and the 5000 is known not to handle Kodachrome well.\n\nFor negative strips (not slides) people have been picking up old minilab scanners like the [Kodak Pakon F135](https://www.analogwestphotography.com/blog/2017/12/29/my-thoughts-on-the-pakon-f135-film-scanner) and [Noritsu LS-600](http://www.gostreetphoto.com/noritsu-ls-600-film-scanner-review/). I've owned both of these scanners. They're designed to chow down huge amounts of film and spit out very good images with minimal input from the operator. Unfortunately, they can only handle unmounted film strips and the prices have ballooned with their popularity. Nowadays they cost 1000-2000 USD. Not terrible for their capabilities though. There are groups on Facebook for both the Noritsu and Pakon that help people purchase and use these scanners. The Noritsu group can get dramatic (it's Facebook afterall) but the knowledge is invaluable if you jump into this. \n\nFor just DIYing it you can also check with local museums. Sometimes you'll find a friendly archivist who will train and help you use their machines. \n\n###DSLR/Mirrorless Scanning\nYou can also scan slides with an Interchangeable Lens Camera. There's a ton of variations on this, but basically you put your slide or negative in front of the camera with a light source behind it and take a photo.\n\nYou can use something like the [Nikon ES-2](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1357884-REG/nikon_27192_es_2_film_digitalizing_adapet.html) or a generic thing that looks vaguely like it (theres a bunch on amazon). The ES-2 is designed to be used with a Nikon Macro lens, but you can make normal lenses into workable macro lenses with extension tubes.\n\nPersonally I would find a good macro lens, a high CRI light table (or just use your phone with a light table app), and a tripod or pole to hold the camera above the setup. This guy[ provides a pretty good video overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsJPeSiSTtg&feature=youtu.be) of the idea behind this. Scanning slides is pretty simple since there's not a bunch of color correction involved. You could use tape, a holder, a stick, or whatever, to mark where the slide should go and just change them out and shoot away. You'll need a good air blower like Giottos Rocket Blaster or  a chemical blower to remove dust since all dust that stays on the frame will have to be manually edited out in post.\n\nThat guy in the video is actually pretty stupid smart and created the [Negative Lab Pro](https://www.negativelabpro.com/) lightroom plugin, which has made [scanning color negatives with a camera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jmfpxaz17w&feature=youtu.be) wayyyy better than it was. There are manual ways to invert the colors but they are usually very time consuming and take a ton of skill. You can check [this thread out for examples](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/9mzea9/negative_lab_pro_a_new_lightroom_plugin_for/e7ijog2/). The software is still being actively developed. I'm getting a macro lens and light table to try this out and compare it with my Noritsu LS-600. It will give me the option to scan small amounts of slides, medium format film, and other odd film types.\n\nRun some searches on DSLR scanning on [Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=scan+slides+with+dslr) and Youtube and you'll find plenty of options and techniques on how to do this. I think it's one of the more economical (if you have a DSLR or mirrorless) options at the moment.\n\nAnyway I hope that helped give you some ideas. I'm not much of an expert, just someone with a bit too much time on his hands to read up and play with this stuff.", "created_utc": 1549742686.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1549753419.0, "id": "eg3xh05", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_aougrx", "parent_id": "t1_eg3uqh5", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/aougrx/acclaimed_mr_rogers_documentary_wont_you_be_my/eg3xh05/", "score": 320, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "camwow13", "author_id": "fsfaf", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I bet those 100 hours of footage are just incredible and intense and frightful.
