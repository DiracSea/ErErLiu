Thank you. I didn't forget. The comment I replied to was about star power lineups, meaning multiple, and not one Aladdin comment with Robin Williams mentioned has even bothered naming someone else from the film so I don't think that applies.

The writer from the OP seems to have given very little deep thought to the subject. \n\nI'm a huge La La Land fan, and there's two reasons why Gosling and Stone were picked. First, Damien Chazelle considers them an iconic couple in the modern era. Their on-screen chemistry was well-received in LLL and is a huge reason why the movie's story is so moving to people. Second, he said that he didn't necessarily want a couple who were professional singers/dancers. I personally feel like LLL is supposed to be a universally relatable story about love vs. dreams first, and a musical second. There's an entire arc in the middle of the movie that is devoid of vocal music (besides the John Legend number which is more for narrative purposes anyway). Have a look at Another Day of Sun, where a bunch of \"look we are so diverse\" LA citizens (aka normal people like us) stuck in traffic on the freeway dance and sing about their ambitions in Hollywood. \n\nAnd let's be real, a ton of people saw Beauty and the Beast because Hermione was going to become the bookworm Disney princess Belle. \n\nI think the intent behind trying to get truly talented people on the big screen is admirable, but those in charge will weigh the pros and cons and sometimes fall back on name recognition and other deliberate reasons.
