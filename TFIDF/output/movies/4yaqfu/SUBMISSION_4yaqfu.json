I started up right around the time Deadpool came out and the cleanest theaters I cleaned were always Deadpool. Simply because he tells everyone to pick up their shit and not be a douche. Believe it or not I saw people laugh at it and reach under their seat remembering those nachos they said they wouldn't finish before previews finished. I fucking wish more movies would put something like that at the end as it would help those of us cleaning a ton.\n\nEdit: I may be a little salty because I just got finished cleaning theaters for 5 hours.\n\nEdit 2: Wake up to front page, gold, and I destroyed inbox. Thanks reddit!\n\nLast edit: Common complaint is \"You'd be out of a job\". No I wouldn't. There's still going to be popcorn kernels on the floor, a spill of soda, and skittles on the staircase. All I'm asking is grab your bag and drink. Also, ushers do more than just clean the theaters. They stock bathrooms, keep hallways clean, let in lines etc. I'd be anything but out of a job. So for those of you saying I'd be fired, I'm assuming you've never actually worked in a theater.", "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "title": "As a person that cleans theaters, one thing I appreciated the most about Deadpool was at the end when he tells everyone to pickup their trash", "url": null, "author_name": "myblunda", "author_id": "c5c1t", "subreddit_name": "movies", "upvote_ratio": 0.79}
