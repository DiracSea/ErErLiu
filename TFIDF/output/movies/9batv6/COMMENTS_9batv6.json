A true story of course, but is this the best representation of German behavior during the Holocaust?  Schindler was an exception.  The vast majority of Germans, most of Europe (and a large part of America) responded to Hitler's Final Solution by either not giving a shit about Jews being gassed in ovens or cheering it on.  Schindler's List also features the wonderful \"gas chamber is actually just a shower\" moment that is a total Spielberg cop out.  I understand the narrative needs not to completely overwhelm the audience with tragedy, as Spielberg remains a populist filmmaker at heart even here, but this is an absurd avoidance of the truth of what happened. I recommend \"Night and Fog\" or \"Shoah\" for far more accurate and potent films about the Holocaust.
