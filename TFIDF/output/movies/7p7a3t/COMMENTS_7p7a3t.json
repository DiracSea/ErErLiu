IMO, they're not happy with the movie (or maybe the movie's fine, but they're not happy with how the production panned out). They could easily drop some money on a Super Bowl commercial (which might still happen), but it's now sounding like they're gonna drop it during a morning show -- likely just to appeal to the more \"general\" audience (which IMO means they're not very confident in the movie). \n\nRegardless, this has nothing to do with the release date being in May. May was the *original* planned release-date, because most Star Wars movies were summer releases to begin with. They *wanted* May to be the month, because *most* Star Wars movies were released in the summer, from the beginning of it. Star Wars literally created the \"summer blockbuster\" thing. \n\nDon't be worried about the time of year, be worried about the lack of marketing -- people keep mentioning that they're purposely trying to allow Last Jedi to stay in the limelight, but according to every movie guy I've heard from, that's not a thing that exists. People will still go to see Last Jedi regardless of whether or not a new Star Wars movie is announced. \n\nNot to mention, most movies make most of their money in the first 2-3 weeks either way, so it's stupid for anyone to argue that they're trying to give more exposure to Last Jedi. At this point, Last Jedi already got as much exposure as it's gonna get. \n\nJust go on youtube and listen to Collider Movie Talk, or John Campea, or Jeremy Jahns, or Screen Junkies, etc. They've all been saying the same things recently. They're starting to get worried now, and if we don't see a trailer some time this week, that just spells bad news for the movie in general. \n\nAt the very least, the movie will get pushed back to December -- and generally, that's not a bad thing. It just means they need more time to make the movie great. But this is a different situation. There were director issues, actor issues, studio issues, etc. Ron Howard is now the director, and I've been rewatching the Andy Griffith Show recently (where Ron Howard is the kid on the show), and I believe in him as a director. \n\nBut even if he's a great director, who's making the best of a bad situation, we can't expect him to be Superman and just re-create the entire movie. And IMO, the lack of marketing suggests that the studio still isn't very confident about it. \n\n", "created_utc": 1515551205.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dsg6gau", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7p7a3t", "parent_id": "t1_dsfijn6", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7p7a3t/it_is_4_months_until_solo_a_star_wars_story_is/dsg6gau/", "score": 6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "frogma", "author_id": "47xq8", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "The trick for this movie is to set your expectations so low that it can't possibly be worse than you're imagining... it's a Han Solo movie without Harrison Ford.

So much of what makes that world great to me is how the world reacts to mutants, and how important this change is to the day-to-day lives of people.\n\nI just don't think that in the MCU, after New York has been invaded by aliens(twice) and then saved by a giant green monster, the norse god of thunder, and a super soldier from WWII that was frozen in ice, that mutants showing up would be as big of a deal. Like, your kid would start to show signs of super powers, and you'd be like \"Oh, like Spiderman, or Hulk, or Captain America, or the Scarlet Witch?\"\n\nEDIT: I guess what I'm getting at is that my primary complaint about the MCU is that it's never taken its own premise seriously. There's hints and nods(like [the Korean Church of Asgard](http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/Korean_Church_of_Asgard)), but overall, the world in the MCU feels very much like ours, the New York in Daredevil seems like our New York, not a New York that was invaded by Aliens a decade ago. The world in the Fox X-Men universe always felt like a world where humanity was dealing with this gigantic change, in how humans view ourselves, in how humans view mutants, how it'd change our psyche. It was able to do this because the only thing going on in those movies was mutants. You can create a world where one huge thing happens, but you can't maintain a world where 12 huge, completely different things happen.

There is no storytelling reason for this movie to be made - even less than Rogue One. Han's character arc begins with him being a callous in-it-for-the-money smuggler and his character develops after he meets Luke, meets OBW and learns about the Force, sees Alderaan blown up, and meets Leia, all of which results in him coming back at the end of the movie to save his friends and join their future adventures. What the fuck is this pre-Tatooine movie going to be about? Han is a flat character before Tatooine. The whole point is the plot of ANH gives him an arc.\n\nBut Disney doesn't think like that, it's just \"X is a known IP, we paid four billion dollars to acquire X, make a movie about X. Fly my lovelies!\" Like putting AT-ATs on Scarif. The only reason they're there is because some Disney exec has a spreadsheet that calculates how many toys, vidyagames and toaster ovens they had to make out of each piece of the IP and those poor AT-ATs weren't pulling their weight.\n\n**EDIT:** to everyone who's saying ***\"I'd like to see his days at the Imperial Academy!\"*** and ***\"What about his first time smuggling for Jabba!\"*** and ***\"You could make a story about how he rescued Chewie!\"*** you people are part of the problem I'm afraid. A story is not just a list of things that happen. Even if those things are cool. \"Cinematic Universe\" filmmaking has blinded people to this. A story is a cause and effect structure (like the Every Day Until structure popularized by Pixar but that's just one model) that moves a character through a progression or arc that is about something more than just overcoming some physical challenge.
