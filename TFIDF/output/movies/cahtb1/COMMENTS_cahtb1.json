Obviously these movies are making HUGE money.

These movies are failing at something that billion dollar movies ought to be doing - they are punching way below their weight in terms of cultural impact.  The Avengers series was already an oddity in terms of how much money it made for how little it inserted ideas into our culture.  No one talks about the first avengers movie, no one cares about the lines from it, or uses it to illustrate a point.  Compare that to Wall Street or the original Star Wars.  \n\nThe same - to an even greater extent - is true with these live action remakes.  They don't contribute anything to culture or society.  They don't introduce any new ideas and frankly I thought Beauty and the Beast live action did a far worse job than the original when it came to issues of acceptance.  \n\nThat seems to be a common theme among all the new Disney movies including Star Wars.  When there is an exception to this it is really so noticeable.  Guardians of the Galaxy, or the first Iron Man, or Black Panther - when they actually manage to hit a cultural base it really stands out.
