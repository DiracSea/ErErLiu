Yes, it was lovely to all four of the original cast members back together again for one last time in those roles (even if Bill Murray's performance was horribly phoned in - both literally and figuratively), but their presence alone doesn't mean that it's essentially a true, canonical *Ghostbusters 3*.

Danny Rubin, who originally wrote the script, recalled how when Ramis started scribing his draft of the film, he immediately and instinctively played up to Murray\u2019s strengths in order to get his old pal to play the lead. It worked, and Murray accepted, but he was experiencing incredible strife in his life at the time of filming and his behaviour on-set became more and more problematic. Not only did he fail to turn up on time, but he would throw tantrums, argue with Ramis over his directorial choices, and insist that the film be more moody and provocative than the straight-forward comedy Ramis desired. Ramis and Murray couldn\u2019t even work on the script together alone, and the filmmaker resorted to sending Rubin to try and improve on the screenplay with the actor.

Dan Aykroyd wrote, directed and starred in it in multiple roles. The movie is very much \"his\" movie. Despite that he asked Chevy Chase to be the star in it. While watching the movie, there are multiple scenes where it feels like Chevy Chase's character is just disinterested in what's going on around him. Like he doesn't care. Which is strange, because he's in danger and threatened through most of the film.\n\nThe reason is because early in to production, he started fighting with Dan Aykroyd. Though perhaps fighting isn't the right word? Belittling is more accurate. He would do multiple takes with minimal effort simply because he wanted the movie to fail, because he knew it was Aykroyd's baby. He constantly insulted Aykroyd, verbally abusing him between takes. His contract guaranteed him a big paycheck even if it was a flop, so he knew he didn't need the movie to succeed, but his supposed friend Aykroyd needed it to work. This was a very expensive movie, with a massive production budget for it's time. Aykroyd had everything to lose if it failed.\n\nOf course, the movie was a flop, and largely due to Chase's lack of performance. While the cast hated Chevy, they loved Aykroyd. He was constantly giving people authority to just express themselves artistically. The film has amazing sets and amazing practical effects because of his creative direction but willingness to step back and let talent do it's own thing. And they did. It's a beautiful if disturbing trainwreck of a film.
