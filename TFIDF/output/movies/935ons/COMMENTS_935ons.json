Outrage culture and demanding firings is certainly not a tactic of their exclusive use or invention.

There was certainly a ton of digital ink spilled regarding Paula Deen losing her job in 2013 for saying racial slurs in her past, I did not see pieces like this written then. I didn't see much support offered for Hulk Hogan when he said abhorrent racial slurs on an old (stolen and private) video of him that became public. In fact, there are STILL articles all over the place criticizing the WWE for giving Hulk a second chance years after the comments came out (and he apologized), and even more years after he actually said them. We can't hold Gunn to a different standard because he's a talented writer and director with work more widely enjoyed than Deen or Hogan's. And we most certainly can't hold him to a different standard because of his outspoken liberalism.\n> \n\nThis is what gets me.
