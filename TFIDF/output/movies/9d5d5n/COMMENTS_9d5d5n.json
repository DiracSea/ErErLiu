Longer cuts create what Tarkovsky called the \"pressure of time,\" which he preferred to build in his scenes. I think there's a very distinct experience felt in watching a Tarkovsky film where you come to get a sort of better spatial understanding of a scene or a film because of how long he can let shots run. Feeling the time tick by in something like \"Stalker,\" especially inside the Zone, to me creates a more intimate and dream-like atmosphere. \n\nPart of the reason I think Tarkovsky's films still stand out, especially against the work of other Soviet contemporaries at the time (much of which is great in its own right, make no mistake), is Tarkovsky's distaste for montage theory. This is a shock to Soviet (and hell, to a degree most) film aesthetic because of the work of people like Eisenstein, Kuleshov, Vertov, etc. who were and are frequently credited with creating the grammar of modern film editing. Tarkovsky did not believe that a scene, or a film in general, was a series of shots which exist in direct relationship to the preceding and succeeding image which move through time. He \"sculpted\" his films in time, letting what he called the \"natural rhythm\" of the shots dictate when it was time to cut. He aimed to create \"poetic films,\" no doubt influenced by the fact that his father was an accomplished poet in the USSR.\n\nThat's kind of a stripped down attempt to explain his editing philosophy without writing a small novella. If you're interested in his philosophy on film at all, track down his book 'Sculpting in Time' and his journals 'Time Within Time.' They're a fascinating read. He had some brilliant theories and philosophies, and a few kooky ones which he thankfully later rejected; in 1966, for example, he said that he felt color was a gimmick and that he knew of no film that used color well. \n\nEdit: Typo, but not a funny one that I would have kept and readily accepted the mockery for having typed.

No humility was intended. I don't work in the academic world of film anymore, so I never get to talk about this with people. When I saw Tarkovsky's name pop up I was pretty excited. All I meant by \"I guess\" was that relative to other people known for their long takes - Kubrick, Tarr, Angelopolous, whomever, really - Tarkovsky is the first that comes to my mind because of my thesis work on him. When I saw the comment about how it seemed like there are so few shots in 2001 for a film of its length, I was preparing almost the exact comment about the shot count in Stalker relative to its length, and it's more or less because Tarkovsky's work is the work I know best in the particular niche topic of more deliberate editing and take lengths.
