But from a storytelling perspective, you expect science fiction to confront the theme of futuristic technology and how it impacts our lives. Star Wars does this nominally (a space ship that can destroy a planet, my dad is a robot!) but it isn't the main thrust at all. While it looks like science fiction, Star Wars is just the hero's journey in a space suit. It feels classical. Personally, I would call it sci-fi, because whenever I hear Space Opera I think of Pavarotti on Jupiter, but a strong argument can be made either way.

Especially in creature design. The use of animatronics instead of CGI was good but the design of some of the prominent creatures felt very uninspired such as the crystal foxes and those long ear horses. Porgs were unique enough, but the Crystal foxes were literally just dogs. And the long ear horses were just that, literally long ear horses. They even have HOOVES! I really feel like they deliberately tried to make things as familiar as possible so that they could sell more toys. I get it, people dont by sarlax pit plushies, but I don't have to give a shit about your long term business model. I just want a good movie set in a unique and unfamiliar universe. Hell, Del Toro's films take place on EARTH and fill you with a greater sense of wonder and awe and all the unique and interesting things you see.\n\n\nOverall my greatest criticism of Star Wars is it got soft with Disney.\n\nIn the original trilogy Luke got his fucking hand chopped off, he almost died in the cold, and its highly implied that Leia was tortured by Vader. In the prequels Anakin got his legs chopped off, Darth maul got sliced in half, Qui-Gon got stabbed through his chest. It felt like things were really at stake.\n\nNow fin gets a cut on his back but you know hes fine. Kylo gets a cut on his face but you know hes fine. And Rey, fucking hell Rey, Not a scratch on her throughout both movies. You feel like they all have this bubble of safety around them. All the thrill is gone. I was almost thinking \"THANK GOD\" when I thought fin was going to sacrifice himself to save his friends. Finally, SOMETHING is happening. Something with weight and significance. But nope. Couldn't even commit to that. What are you keeping him around for? Tell a damn story! In a story not everyone has to make it to the end. But hey, you cant show anything too sad or scary or dramatic or unpredictable or else it will upset our charts that show what viewers want.\n\nTELL A DAMN STORY. At least in The force Awakens they told a story. Things were happening. The plot moved along. What was accomplished with the last jedi? the last jedi felt like a filler episode where all the characters decided to go to the mall or some shit, but instead they spent 70% of the move \"just barely running away from a ship behind them\" cut back, still running away, next scene? still running away. Are we going to go anywhere with this? nope, still running away. Okay its the last 10 minutes of the film, Hey a planet was right there the whole fucking time!\n\nJust ugh. My issues were never that they \"ruined the expanded universe\" or any of the other BS excuses that people on here like to play criticism off as. My issues were it was just bad film making and bad writing.

Historically, science-fiction stories have had a grounding in actual science, but now this is only expected of hard science fiction.\n\nFor me SW absolutely does not fit in that definition.\n\n- It's never our technological innovations, in fact there's no innovation in that universe, just make bigger death stars and bigger star destroyers\n- It's got supernatural (The Force), and only the supernatural as an explanation for anything remotely in need of an explanation, how does the Death Star work? In R.O it's basically mine some force crystals and stickem in there. If they try to explain something with some sort of science speak like \"midochlorians\" than it ruins the universe as a whole, suddenly it's not magic and it's quantifiable.\n- The entire arc of the movies is based on WW2 and its politics, the rebel alliance vs the empire (Allies vs Nazi Germany+Japan)\n- Entire planets have one village, the rest is a giant forest or desert. They used to be better with this in the original trilogy and the prequels but the new trilogy is AWFUL at it, so far WE HAVE NEVER SEEN ANY SEMBLANCE OF A POPULATED PLANET and even if it's not sci-fi, they need to stop doing that becuase it's killing the usual scaling of the universe.\n\nAnyway, I rambled, but it irks me when anyone wants to categorise SW as Sci-Fi when it's not.\n", "created_utc": 1518579492.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "du7u6gp", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7xcrc9", "parent_id": "t1_du7k0fh", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7xcrc9/star_wars_episode_9_hires_blade_runner_2049_art/du7u6gp/", "score": 12, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "simward", "author_id": "4vtqm", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I'm holding out hope for a standalone Obi-Wan film that's just straight Ronin.", "created_utc": 1518569170.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "du7khdu", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7xcrc9", "parent_id": "t1_du7jdfa", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7xcrc9/star_wars_episode_9_hires_blade_runner_2049_art/du7khdu/", "score": 18, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Emperor_Neuro", "author_id": "g0vi7", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Yeah, I wish fantasy had more fusion stuff!
