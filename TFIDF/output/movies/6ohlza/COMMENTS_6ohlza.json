I hear a shit ton of stories about stupid shit frats do at other schools, but my school's Greek system (which I'm a member of) really doesn't do stupid shit or fuck around or promote being older teenagers. \n\nHonestly, the worst thing that happened last year was a campus wide snowball fight (school of <1000 students) between all the houses and someone thought it'd never funny to freeze them and break some windows. Their house and the school dealt with it quickly, he apologized, and all is fine in our system. I think it's less the fault of the fraternity/sorority system, and more the mindset of the people joining and the atmosphere that is promoted by the school and media around them.
