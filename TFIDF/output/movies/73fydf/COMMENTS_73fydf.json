Wait till you hear about William Pitt the Younger. He makes Churchill look like a bibulous old windbag. His father used to stand him on a tree stump in the garden and made him stand there in the rain and wind until he was able to give a proper speech in Latin. Aged *4*! They thought he was going to die of tuberculosis aged 14 so they sent him to study at Cambridge so his dying in the house wouldn't depress his father. But he lived! It was his father who died while giving a dramatic speech in the house of Lords\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_the_Earl_of_Chatham#/media/File:The_Death_of_the_Earl_of_Chatham_by_John_Singleton_Copley.jpg\n\nTo 'avenge' his death, Pitt the Younger entered paliament the same year and became Chancellor of the Exchequer at *21*, domininating the Commons when everyone else wanted to cave in to Napoleon, though he was leading a party of *one* - himself! The only person who backed him was George III who, as everyone knew, was insane. By the age of 24, he had scraped together a majority in the Common out of nothing, and became Prime Minister. It was called the 'mince pie administration' because everyone thought he was just a kid who would eat mince pies and then disappear. Some little bitch wrote an anonymous poem in the Times:\n\n\"Above the rest, majestically great,\nBehold the infant Atlas of the state,\nThe matchless miracle of modern days,\nIn whom Britannia to the world displays\nA sight to make surrounding nations stare;\nA kingdom trusted to a school-boy's care\".\n\nInstead, he remained in office for twenty years by which time he recouped George's losses in the US by building a new empire in India, he backed William Wilberforce and the Anti-Slavery movement, while building up the Royal Navy just in time because the French and Spanish fleets were coming together to sweep the Channel clear for the Napoleonic invasion force at a little place called Trafalgar... And we was doing all this while drinking FOUR bottle of port a day! He died at an incredibly young age and his mother was astounded to find he had debts of \u00a340,000 - hell, that's about $25 million today - and couldn't think what he had spent all that money on, since he was apparently working  twenty hours a day. They didn't tell her he was blowing it all on Cheapside prostitutes, smuggled in at breakfast time every day, two at a time. He would do them both on a map table and then they'd pop out the back door of No. 10 with a fiver each. On his death, two thousand black clad tarts processed silently and weeping down the Albany to mourn his passing. A grateful Commons voted unanimously, to waive the debts - but specifically didn't mention who the money was to go to in order not to embarass his mama, the Countess of Chatham. Here's a picture showing how good he was, literally shitting on the rest of parliament:\n\nhttp://media.gettyimages.com/photos/british-political-cartoon-titled-the-giant-factotum-amusing-himself-picture-id72856762\n", "created_utc": 1506801616.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1506804444.0, "id": "dnq837n", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_73fydf", "parent_id": "t3_73fydf", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/73fydf/new_poster_for_darkest_hour_winston_churchill/dnq837n/", "score": 61, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Lol Bollywood should make a biopic about Hitler next.", "created_utc": 1506800462.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dnq77fc", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_73fydf", "parent_id": "t3_73fydf", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/73fydf/new_poster_for_darkest_hour_winston_churchill/dnq77fc/", "score": 71, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "_StuckInTheMiddle_", "author_id": "12qmkc", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Haven't enough people played him on screen plenty of times ?\n", "created_utc": 1506801798.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dnq8873", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_73fydf", "parent_id": "t3_73fydf", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/73fydf/new_poster_for_darkest_hour_winston_churchill/dnq8873/", "score": 10, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "SilentSaboteur", "author_id": "j31b6", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "isn't this the third churchil movie of the 2000s?

The rest of the trailer was very serious and then this random joke of a line... maybe they're trying to establish Churchill as a formidable debater with a sense of humor, it still sticks out like a sore thumb in that trailer.\n\nIt makes me worry about the tone of the movie overall, that it might come off erratic and bipolar.

Was Churchill also a racist? Yes he was. But he NEVER let any notion of race influence his policies. The suggestion that, like Hitler, he purposefully manufactured a genocide to kill off people because he deemed them lower than himself is an absolute falsity.\n\nIn the article that spread this pernicious falsity it is claimed: \"\"Up to 3 million people starved to death while British officials begged Churchill to direct food supplies to the region. He bluntly refused. He raged that it was their own fault for \"breeding like rabbits\". At other times, he said the plague was \"merrily\" culling the population.\"\nThis is absolute and utter nonsense. First of all, who caused the famine? The Japanese did by attacking Burma, which supplied the majority of grain for the region. Hindu merchants then hoarded the grain further exacerbating the shortage. Churchill appointed Wavell as Field Marshal, who mobilized the military to transport more food to the region. Churchill wrote to him:\n\n\n\"Peace, order and a high condition of war-time well-being among the masses of the people constitute the essential foundation of the forward thrust against the enemy\u2026.The hard pressures of world-war have for the first time for many years brought conditions of scarcity, verging in some localities into actual famine, upon India. Every effort must be made, even by the diversion of shipping urgently needed for war purposes, to deal with local shortages\u2026.Every effort should be made by you to assuage the strife between the Hindus and Moslems and to induce them to work together for the common good\"\n\n\nThis wasn't exactly helped by the repeated strikes that Gandhi was calling, diverting divisions that could have been used to attack the Japanese. Nor did a huge cyclone that destroyed crops in 1942. Churchill's efforts were not enough. Next, Churchill turned to aid from other countries. Canada offered aid, but shipping from Canada would take 2 months, whereas shipping from Australia would take 3-4 weeks. So eventually Churchill wrote to Roosevelt, who had the ships available to take the grain from Austrialia to India:\n\n\n\"I am seriously concerned about the food situation in India\u2026.Last year we had a grievous famine in Bengal through which at least 700,000 people died. This year there is a good crop of rice, but we are faced with an acute shortage of wheat, aggravated by unprecedented storms\u2026.By cutting down military shipments and other means, I have been able to arrange for 350,000 tons of wheat to be shipped to India from Australia during the first nine months of 1944. This is the shortest haul. I cannot see how to do more.\n\n\nI have had much hesitation in asking you to add to the great assistance you are giving us with shipping but a satisfactory situation in India is of such vital importance to the success of our joint plans against the Japanese that I am impelled to ask you to consider a special allocation of ships to carry wheat to India from Australia\u2026.We have the wheat (in Australia) but we lack the ships. I have resisted for some time the Viceroy\u2019s request that I should ask you for your help, but\u2026 I am no longer justified in not asking for your help.\"\n\n\nRoosevelt said no. To accuse Churchill of not even trying to help, no, of trying to deliberately murder the Indians is a complete and utter falsity. Was he a racist? Yes. Did he ever letter racism colour his policy, which he frequently criticized Hitler of doing? No.\n\n\nThe man who spread this slander about Churchill is called Johann Hari. Unsurprisingly, he is repeatedly accused of plagiarism, leading to his suspension from the Independent, and enjoys editing the Wikipedia pages of anyone who criticizes him. To quote him \" I started to notice some things I didn\u2019t like in the Wikipedia entry about me, so I took them out. To do that, I created a user-name that wasn\u2019t my own. Using that user-name, I continued to edit my own Wikipedia entry and some other people\u2019s too. I took out nasty passages about people I admire \u2013 like Polly Toynbee, George Monbiot, Deborah Orr and Yasmin Alibhai-Brown. I factually corrected some other entries about other people. But in a few instances, I edited the entries of people I had clashed with in ways that were juvenile or malicious: I called one of them anti-Semitic and homophobic, and the other a drunk. \".\n\n\nDoes that sound like a man who would make a balance judgement based on the evidence?\n\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/johann-hari/johann-hari-a-personal-apology-2354679.html\n\n\nVolume 1, 2 and 3 of William Manchester's 'The Last Lion',\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Lion:_Winston_Spencer_Churchill\n\n\nChurchill - \"The River War\", https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_River_War\n\n\nhttps://winstonchurchill.hillsdale.edu/did-churchill-cause-the-bengal-famine/\n\n\nhttps://www.winstonchurchill.org/resources/in-the-media/churchill-in-the-news/the-bengali-famine\n\n\nhttps://richardlangworth.com/churchill-bengal-famine", "created_utc": 1507381137.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "do17gks", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_73fydf", "parent_id": "t1_dnq6xym", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/73fydf/new_poster_for_darkest_hour_winston_churchill/do17gks/", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Germany in 1931 was a pauper state where it's citizens couldn't afford bread.

And the fact that the nominally British armies defending India were mostly Indians?\n\nIt is farcical to compare it to the organised slaughter of millions in death camps.", "created_utc": 1506811207.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1506811503.0, "id": "dnqf8oc", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_73fydf", "parent_id": "t1_dnq8c1q", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/73fydf/new_poster_for_darkest_hour_winston_churchill/dnqf8oc/", "score": 31, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Fornad", "author_id": "7w7pm", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "[Bengal Famine of 1943](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_famine_of_1943)", "created_utc": 1506806214.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dnqbkdu", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_73fydf", "parent_id": "t1_dnqagf2", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/73fydf/new_poster_for_darkest_hour_winston_churchill/dnqbkdu/", "score": 53, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "ghostfivenine", "author_id": "1652mw", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "[From 1:30](https://youtu.be/BSRI6RbKYOA).

Mukerjee delves into official documents and oral accounts of survivors to paint a horrifying portrait of how Churchill, as part of the Western war effort, ordered the diversion of food from starving Indians to already well-supplied British soldiers and stockpiles in Britain and elsewhere in Europe, including Greece and Yugoslavia. And he did so with a churlishness that cannot be excused on grounds of policy: Churchill's only response to a telegram from the government in Delhi about people perishing in the famine was to ask why Gandhi hadn't died yet.\n\n> British imperialism had long justified itself with the pretense that it was conducted for the benefit of the governed. Churchill's conduct in the summer and fall of 1943 gave the lie to this myth. \"I hate Indians,\" he told the Secretary of State for India, Leopold Amery. \"They are a beastly people with a beastly religion.\" The famine was their own fault, he declared at a war-cabinet meeting, for \"breeding like rabbits.\"\n\n> As Mukerjee's accounts demonstrate, some of India's grain was also exported to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) to meet needs there, even though the island wasn't experiencing the same hardship; Australian wheat sailed past Indian cities (where the bodies of those who had died of starvation littered the streets) to depots in the Mediterranean and the Balkans; and offers of American and Canadian food aid were turned down. India was not permitted to use its own sterling reserves, or indeed its own ships, to import food. And because the British government paid inflated prices in the open market to ensure supplies, grain became unaffordable for ordinary Indians. Lord Wavell, appointed Viceroy of India that fateful year, considered the Churchill government's attitude to India \"negligent, hostile and contemptuous.\"\n\nIt was a genocide, and it should be judged in the same way as the Western World treats Holodomor.\n\nSome people choose to absolve Churchill of his role in the famine by pushing the blame onto his nutter friend Frederick Lindemann, but ultimately Churchill's rabid racism made it far easier for him to rationalise those anti-Indian decisions with led to the death of millions of people.

Shashi Tharoor, the author of this piece, makes a very logical claim for the ill-effects of colonialism which are regularly whitewashed by the British. ([Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7CW7S0zxv4) is a famous Oxford Union video of his which went viral).\n\nhttps://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2031992,00.html\n\n> In 1943, some 3 million brown-skinned subjects of the Raj died in the Bengal famine, one of history's worst. Mukerjee delves into official documents and oral accounts of survivors to paint a horrifying portrait of how Churchill, as part of the Western war effort, ordered the diversion of food from starving Indians to already well-supplied British soldiers and stockpiles in Britain and elsewhere in Europe, including Greece and Yugoslavia. And he did so with a churlishness that cannot be excused on grounds of policy: Churchill's only response to a telegram from the government in Delhi about people perishing in the famine was to ask why Gandhi hadn't died yet.\n\n> British imperialism had long justified itself with the pretense that it was conducted for the benefit of the governed. Churchill's conduct in the summer and fall of 1943 gave the lie to this myth. \"I hate Indians,\" he told the Secretary of State for India, Leopold Amery. \"They are a beastly people with a beastly religion.\" The famine was their own fault, he declared at a war-cabinet meeting, for \"breeding like rabbits.\"\n\n> As Mukerjee's accounts demonstrate, some of India's grain was also exported to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) to meet needs there, even though the island wasn't experiencing the same hardship; Australian wheat sailed past Indian cities (where the bodies of those who had died of starvation littered the streets) to depots in the Mediterranean and the Balkans; and offers of American and Canadian food aid were turned down. India was not permitted to use its own sterling reserves, or indeed its own ships, to import food. And because the British government paid inflated prices in the open market to ensure supplies, grain became unaffordable for ordinary Indians. Lord Wavell, appointed Viceroy of India that fateful year, considered the Churchill government's attitude to India \"negligent, hostile and contemptuous.\"\n\nIt was a genocide, and it should be judged in the same way as the Western World treats Holodomor.\n\nSome people choose to absolve Churchill of his role in the famine by pushing the blame onto his nutter friend Frederick Lindemann, but ultimately Churchill's rabid racism made it far easier for him to rationalise those anti-Indian decisions with led to the death of millions of people.

They were crushed in the games.\n\n>Of the 90,000 German troops who landed only 15,400 returned to France. 33,000 were taken prisoner, 26,000 were killed in the fighting and 15,000 drowned in the English Channel. All six umpires deemed the invasion a resounding failure.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Sea_Lion_(wargame)\n\nAnd even had the Navy not stopped the second wave of the German invasion, it absolutely was not large enough to contend with the insane quantity of defences Churchill had built. They would have gotten 50 miles into the country before the full reinforcement of the 1.5million home guard were on them.
