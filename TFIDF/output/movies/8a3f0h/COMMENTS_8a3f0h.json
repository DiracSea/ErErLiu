But there is a lot of common ground. Both are kid friendly. Both have a fairy-tale quality to them. Typically, violence is deemphasized in both (Mononoke is a notable exception here, and is perhaps the Miyazaki film that most resembles action oriented anime familiar to fans of the medium). Most things are always very cute (again, Mononoke is arguably an exception as some of the imagery is actually quite grotesque).\n\nThis isn't to say the two styles aren't clearly distinct in all sorts of ways. But there is definitely enough in Miyazaki that jives with the expectations engendered by Disney to not totally throw off the casual American viewer. This is less true nowadays, especially among millenniasl who grew up on Dragon Ball Z, but back in the day I imagine it helped Miyazaki garner a wider audience. As a parent in the 90's, you would see an advert for something like Kiki's and recognize it as the sort of film you like to take your kids to see. This is less true of something like Grave of the Fireflies.\n\nObviously this in no way reflects on the quality of Miyazaki's films (which are often masterpieces), other types of anime (which are sometimes also masterpieces, like Grave of the Fireflies or Akira), or even Disney (Disney films are also often masterpieces like Cinderella).", "created_utc": 1522976093.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dwvxzp3", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8a3f0h", "parent_id": "t1_dwvr6bo", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8a3f0h/isao_takahata_studio_ghibli_cofounder_and/dwvxzp3/", "score": 46, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "White___Velvet", "author_id": "kmqtj", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I think I know what you're trying to say, but take error with the wording.

There was little left for the civilians, so the soldiers forced the civilians to either kill themselves or kill each other so they\u2019d have more to eat. They also used the remaining survivors as human shields. Initially, the Americans would try and help the Okinawan civilians but soon the Japanese would send Okinawans to trick the Americans.

When the Americans actually treated the survivors nicely and fed them, they were shocked and confused. Basically, the entire Battle of Okinawa was a disaster all because of the Japanese government. \n\nThis treatment throughout history has caused Okinawans to still resent the Tokyo government and not caring about them and throwing them under the bus.
