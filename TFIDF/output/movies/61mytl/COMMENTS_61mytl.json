Even without Spider-man, I think a solo film focusing on Eddie Brock's conflicted nature could have a lot of emotional depth. Like him being mortified by the things he does under the symbiote's influence, and over time developing some semblance of control over it. Making a genuine horror film out of it sounds like they're starting in the right direction. And with the recent successes in R-rated comic films I hope they have the confidence to take an R-rating if they have to. Venom is my all time favourite comic character so I really hope they don't try to censor him just for a lower rating, but also not force a higher rating than they deserve just trying to emulate someone else's success.\n\nAdditionally, if they are eventually able to make a film with both Spider-man and Venom then having Venom already established could be a good thing. Once MCU Spidey has been around long enough to include Venom's more mature content then that would be the best time to introduce Carnage. For example, say a post-credits scene in Venom's movie alludes to the creation of the Carnage symbiote. Then in a later film we follow Spider-man fighting Venom for the first time, and we are periodically shown scenes of Carnage bonding with Cassidy, escaping prison, and eventually going on a rampage a la Maximum Carnage. Then Spider-man and Venom develop an uncertain alliance to deal with the greater evil.\n\nAlso Agent Venom is a terrible idea for a first film.

The symbiote became enraged at being abandoned and became Venom when it found a new host.\n\nOriginally Venom was a villain of Spider-man's and acted more or less as an evil version of Spider-man, since he possesses a very similar power set due to being bonded with Spider-man. But epending on who the host is, Venom can also be a hero and ally of Spider-man. Some of the main hosts are:\n\n**Eddie Brock** - The first host after Spider-man, originally a villain, but eventually became more of an anti-hero. He just recently regained the symbiote in the comics and it's unclear what his alignment will be, although it seems hinted he'll be a villain\n\n**Mac Gargan** - A villain of Spider-man's known as the Scorpion, he eventually gains possession of the symbiote and is a pure villain as Venom.\n\n**Flash Thompson** - The most recent host, Flash was a former rival of Spider-man's before becoming a friend. He was a hero and regularly helped other heroes as Venom, ranging from Spider-man and the Avengers, to the Thunderbolts and the Guardians of the Galaxy.\n\n**Spider-man** - I felt obligated to put Spider-man since he was the original host, but he remains as himself when in possession of the symbiote, he doesn't turn into Venom.\n\n[Here's the Marvel Wikia entry if you want to read more in-depth on him.](http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Venom_\\(Klyntar\\)_\\(Earth-616\\))", "created_utc": 1490556017.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dffs6b5", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_61mytl", "parent_id": "t1_dffqn0y", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/61mytl/venom_movie_filming_fall_2017_described_as_horror/dffs6b5/", "score": 17, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Phanque", "author_id": "6ills", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Venom was a symbiot that once landing on earth paired with spiderman, it gave him even more amazing strength, super sense, lightning reflexes but with all the good that came with this new relationship it began messing with his mind, making him more volatile and angry (and apparently a tap dancer) so Spiderman tried to rid himself of the symbiotic relationship and without giving away too much he found a way.            \n           \nSo the now freshly hurt and betrayed Venom/symbiot was left wandering without a host until by chance it comes across Eddie Brock, Brock isnt evil, he just got a raw gig and fucked out of a job and blamed and hated Spiderman. So Alien being with unadulterated hatred for Spiderman teams up with guy with hatred for Spiderman, one of the things you learn fairly quickly is Brock believes in justice, he believes in looking out for the innocents but his alien counterpart unfortunately sometimes makes him go a little too far in seeking justice.             \n                \nBut the one thing thats persistent is Venoms hatred and loathing and quest for vengeance on Spiderman.                  \n               \nTo try to compare Venom to other comic heros I would say hes kind of a mix of Deadpool and Punisher in that he at heart hes not evil but at the same time his moral compass is a bit skewed where most super heroes would beat up a mugger and leave him for or take him to the police, Venom is more likely to break their arms and leave them bleeding out in a pool of their own piss and blood because fuck them they shouldnt have been mugging a little old lady.               \n                 \nBeen years since I read the comics so maybe someone else can chime in.", "created_utc": 1490555842.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dffs1j5", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_61mytl", "parent_id": "t1_dffqn0y", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/61mytl/venom_movie_filming_fall_2017_described_as_horror/dffs1j5/", "score": 79, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "dizorkmage", "author_id": "c0ard", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Venom has gone through a few different iterations since his inception.

Nearly the same time, Matt Murdock, Daredevil, is talking to an old Judge friend of his, and when the judge leaves, he is attacked by a man with a double-barreled shotgun. In the commotion, the Judge returns and is killed and the man escapes, proclaiming himself to be the \"Sin-Eater.\" Spider-Man is drawn to the scene by the gunfire and meets the Sin-Eater. He sees he has Jean DeWolff's police badge on his belt, confirming that he was the one who killed her, but the Sin-Eater escapes, firing into the crowd to cause a distraction. After the ruckus dies down, Daredevil and Spider-Man compare notes and decide to track down and find this guy for revenge on their dead friends.\n\nMeanwhile, the public killings of two city officials make headlines and a huge uproar begins. The people of NYC want the Sin-Eater taken in. It's vaguely religious, with a Reverend running the show and spitting fire and brimstone. It doesn't help that one of the people the Sin-Eater shot while he was escaping Spider-Man dies of his wounds, and Spider-Man blames himself for dodging the shot and letting that person die. At Jean DeWolff's funeral, Matt Murdock can tell the Sin-Eater is nearby but can't tell who it is. They know the Sin-Eater is going to strike again, and they're right-- that night, the priest who officiated the funeral is killed by the Sin-Eater.\n\nEnter Eddie Brock. He is a journalist from California working with the Daily Globe. One day he gets cold-called by a random number and it turns out to be the Sin-Eater himself, confessing to his crimes and wanting to publish his manifesto in the newspaper. Brock is ecstatic! He publishes the tell-all expose of the Sin-Eater to a massive public outcry. People try to get Eddie to tell them who the Sin-Eater is, to stop the murders, but he won't-- as he has his integrity to uphold and he doesn't want the ride to end because he is BASKING in the attention. It makes him famous, it makes everyone jealous of him, and most of all, he's going to use it to springboard his career and make it big!\n\nThe next day, the Sin-Eater bursts into the Daily Bugle, demanding to speak to J. Jonah Jameson. Peter Parker hits him with a typewriter (seriously) and knocks him out. They identify him as Emil Gregg, and he confesses to all of the crimes, including planning to kill J. Jonah Jameson in the meeting he demanded! Matt Murdock arrives, hears the confession, but knows he isn't the Sin-Eater because their heartbeats don't match. Because Daredevil can do shit like that in the comics, no joke. (He once tasted the air and deduced he was going to be ambushed in that place because someone had made sure to clean it so he couldn't taste anything on it-- a surefire sign that someone who was familiar with his powers was plotting something!)\n\nThe two compare notes again and Daredevil decide to write off Emil Gregg as the killer, but Spider-Man is like, no way, something is up, my Spidey-Sense is tingling. They go to his apartment and find the next-door apartment broken into. It turns out Emil Gregg's neighbor, Stan Carter, is the Sin-Eater. Emil Gregg was hearing \"voices\" telling him to commit crimes, and those voices were Stan Carter's through the paper-thin walls of their adjacent apartments. Emil broke into Stan's apartment and stole his Sin-Eater gear, geared up and took off to do what the voices told him to do! The two heroes immediately set off knowing that the Sin-Eater is still at large.\n\nThere's some more stuff with the real Sin Eater trying to kill J. Jonah Jameson and Betty Brandt but Daredevil and Spider-Man catch Carter and take him to justice. A crowd also tries to lynch him. There's also a Daredevil vs. Spider-Man fight because Peter can't control himself and starts beating the Sin-Eater to death in a fury after Betty Brandt is almost killed. This leads into the \"symbiote being a negative influence on Spider-Man\" theme of the next arc, fighting crime when he's asleep and generally fucking with him storyline that will ultimately end with Peter ditching the symbiote in the Lady of Our Saints Church bellfry.\n\nTurns out the Sin-Eater was a SHIELD experiment gone awry. Whoops! Sorry. \n\nWell after the real Sin-Eater has been taken in, it comes out that Emil Gregg is a \"serial confessor\" who takes credit for all kinds of nebulous crimes without having committed them, and that the Sin-Eater thing was basically his dream scenario-- an actual supervillain he could take credit for being, complete with costumes and props. Emil Gregg is the Sin-Eater that called Eddie, not the real one, and so... well... Eddie is a fraud. Everything he published was a lie. He fell for being cold-called by a random person, put his integrity and ethics on the line, and it turns out he fucked up bad. (Eddie Brock is the kind of guy who would fall for the Nigerian Prince email scam, for sure)\n\nEddie Brock is made persona non grata overnight. Brock's \"exposes\" written on the fake Sin-Eater not only put actual real people in danger by publishing false information that misled police but also muddied the waters surrounding the investigation by Daredevil and Spider-Man making it easier for the real Sin-Eater to almost succeed at killing J. Jonah Jameson. Brock's credibility is completely ruined. His wife leaves him and he's fired from the Globe. Eddie, of course, blames **Spider-Man** for this for some incredulous reason. If he had never caught the real Sin-Eater, Brock would have never lost his job! He can't be at fault! He's... he's Eddie Brock, god dammit!\n\nEddie Brock tries to pick himself back up again but can't, it's too hard and everyone knows him as the laughingstock who in reality probably got a few people actually killed. So he goes to the Lady of Our Saints Church to ask forgiveness for committing suicide the same night that Spider-Man decides to rid himself of the Symbiote once and for all. Spider-Man rings the bells to force the symbiote to relinquish its grip on him, and basically drips right down into Brock's head through the floorboards. After that it's comic book history.\n\nThe Death of Jean DeWolffe storyline I told you above, with the Sin-Eater in it? That came out in later 1985, early 1986. Amazing Spider-Man #300 that revealed Eddie Brock as Venom? That came out in May 1988. The two stories had very little to do with eachother at all, with #300 basically inventing Eddie Brock wholesale to introduce as the villain of the week and to give a motive to. This narrative of the Sin-Eater and Brock wasn't connected at all when written! When Venom appears in #300, he's soundly defeated and then, for some reason, he was given a second shot later on in another storyline. Todd MacFarlane made Venom as a bog-standard boring as fuck \"dark mirror\" evil twin type villain, and then Erik Larsen picked up Spider-Man-- good fucking God, Erik Larsen!-- and added the ridiculously badass tongue and green drool that made Venom's look so inconic instead of [\"black suit spider-man with an evil toothy face.\"](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4d/EddieBrock-Bonding-and-First-Appearance.jpg)\n\nAnd then give or take eight years and he's one of the strongest and most feared Spider-Man villains, definitely top 3 most iconic, and one of the most popular with the fans.\n\nAnd he started as a \"we need a new villain to fill-in on this story here, you guys got any ideas?\" that's best result was \"evil spider-man.\"\n\n", "created_utc": 1490572503.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1490573297.0, "id": "dfg4e1f", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_61mytl", "parent_id": "t1_dfg0fmi", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/61mytl/venom_movie_filming_fall_2017_described_as_horror/dfg4e1f/", "score": 17, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Andvarinaut", "author_id": "7t19n", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "He was doing an investigative story on a serial killer called the Sin-Eater and had planned to name a crazy guy called Emil Gregg who had contacted him claiming to be the Sin-Eater, but around the same time the article came out Spider-Man caught the real Sin-Eater; it turned out Mr. Gregg was a compulsive confessor who lived next door to the real Sin-Eater and thought his overhearing him planning his murders was a voice in his head making him do it.", "created_utc": 1490572539.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1490572722.0, "id": "dfg4ey8", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_61mytl", "parent_id": "t1_dfg0fmi", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/61mytl/venom_movie_filming_fall_2017_described_as_horror/dfg4ey8/", "score": 6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "LibraryLass", "author_id": "bmj2u", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Edward_Brock_(Earth-616)#From_Success_to_Failure\n\nEddie thought he had a big scoop, one that would turn his life around.
