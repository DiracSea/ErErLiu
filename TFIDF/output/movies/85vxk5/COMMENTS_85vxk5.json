And it's implied those things, and his tendency to blow up and get drunk when things don't go his way led to the dissolution of his marriage.  \n\nAnd the movie totallly strips the little that he has left to hold onto from him step by step.  He learns his wife has remarried.  His book is finally rejected.  His loyalty to his friend costs him his chances with Maya and leads to having his car wrecked. He learns his ex-wife is not only married, but expecting a child. Until finally, he drinks his prized bottle of wine which he's been saving to celebrate the day he is finally published, alone, in a fast food restaurant, out of a styrofoam cup. And that's pretty much how the movie ends until Maya leaves a message on his answering machine, in part about how much she loves his book even though it wasn't published and he drives back to wine country to her apartment.\n\nEarlier in the movie, when bonding with Maya over their shared interest in wines, Miles tells her why he prefers Pinot Noir.\n\n>It\u2019s a hard grape to grow, as you know.

Only somebody who really takes the time\u2026 to understand Pinot\u2019s potential\u2026 can then coax it into its fullest expression.\u201d\n\nAnd that's all Miles can do really.

But she is married to Bill Lawrence. Not to take away from her acting abilities just pointing it out as to why she pops up in both so heavily. \n\nBut they do have a lot of Scrubs alumni come in and guest spot.  Ik Ken Jenkins (Kelso) plays Chick in CT. He\u2019s in a quite a few episodes. And Zach Braff (J.D) pops up in it as a pizza delivery guy. \n\nBut Sarah Chalke (Elliot), Nicole Sullivan (Jill), Scott Foley (Sean), and Sam Lloyd (Ted) all pop up in multiple episodes. Plus I think the Todd pops up. \n\nOh and there\u2019s nice little continuity between shows. Sam Lloyd plays Ted in both shows. He even says that he\u2019s going to Hawaii cause his girlfriend Gooch left him for a surgeon named Hooch. \n\nThere\u2019s a private practice owned by Drs. Cox, Reid and Turk that pops up for a second. \n\nNow I wonder if there\u2019s like a connection between a lot of sitcoms cause I notice that these two shows have cast members or guest stars that appear in Friends and The Drew Carey show frequently. \n\n\n\n", "created_utc": 1521606123.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dw18iho", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_85vxk5", "parent_id": "t1_dw0yuwn", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/85vxk5/amy_poehler_to_direct_star_in_and_produce_netflix/dw18iho/", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "mgarcia1211", "author_id": "8stia", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "not only that but they make references to scrub on several occasions ", "created_utc": 1521614882.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dw1diri", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_85vxk5", "parent_id": "t1_dw0yuwn", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/85vxk5/amy_poehler_to_direct_star_in_and_produce_netflix/dw1diri/", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "betsujin420", "author_id": "12bxh91", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Side note, how the fuck did Paul Giamatti not get an Oscar nomination for Sideways?
