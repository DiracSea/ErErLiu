Publishers often give out early review copies to the media, so that they can publish a review on release date. And obviously a media outlet really wants these because you don't want to be one of the only website without a review of that new highly hyped game.\n\nBut this gives publishers a certain amount of power. They get to decide who gets the early copies. I made a little list of abuse of thos power once (I'll try to dig it up if there is enough animo), but to name a few things: \n\n* A publisher that demands (or very much hints at wanting) a high score, or no review copy next time.\n\n* Publishers that want to be more prominently featured or they stop their commercials (the major publishers are a big source of income for certain websites).\n\n* A publisher that demands their game to be reviewed by certain reviewers, or no copy.\n\nThere's this weird game going on between certain reviewers and publishers.
