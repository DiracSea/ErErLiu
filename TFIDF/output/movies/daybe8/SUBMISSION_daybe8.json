IMDB Has been historically fairly reliable to review ratings (6.4+ usually worth seeing) before watching something minus a couple genres. TV and horror films ratings are rarely reliable but rating a movie you haven\u2019t seen really messes up the accuracy and reliability of the rating system. \n\nTLDR; be ethical. Don\u2019t rate something you haven\u2019t experienced, anywhere really.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the award, friend. I think it\u2019s my first one. Cheers.\n\nEdit 2: Some people asked why I was reading the reviews of an unreleased film. I only looked into the reviews because I saw it was sitting at 9.6/10 with tens of thousands of reviews.
