The recent She-Ra had people complaining that she wasn't sexy enough. There are things with female characters added that get shit on as SJW propaganda before it even comes out. I'm glad that you \"as a male\" enjoyed Buffy the Vampire slayer but when women consistently get the short end of the stick in terms of media representation it feels weird for someone who doesn't experience that to tell us what to enjoy. Is there an issue with big film studios making bad movies for political points, sure. Is it an epidemic that threatens to consume all media, I highly doubt it. \n\nHonestly I have no idea what your specific complaint even is. What does \"women don't have to be anything other than women\" mean? Does it mean that women should only be in womanly roles? I would assume not considering you like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and she was pretty much the archetypal vampire hunter but with highschool problems. If there are a bunch of generic action scripts to be turned into a movie, there is literally no objection I could reasonably think of to have some of them star women. For Star-Wars, the main character doesn't have to be a man so I don't really see a problem there either.\n\n If you're concerned more with the execution than the actual idea of having more prominent female characters then your statements aren't even useful for that. Because two bad movies isn't really enough to justify your concerns of that becoming an epidemic. Like I just don't understand where you're coming from because all of your statements sound pretty sexist. How does one \"forcefully add wo\" onto archetypal characters. What do you mean we can be \"heroes of our own\". What exactly does it mean to \"replace men\" by just having women assume a hero role? If you took away your beginning statement it reads exactly like an incel complaining about the \"lack of feminine women\" in media. Women can be fire fighters, and soldiers, and action heroes, and more; its not \"forcing\" to put a woman in a leading action role. Hell I don't even think this is the point you're trying to make, I'm just trying to tell you that your phrasing leaves a lot to be desired. Your phrasing makes it seem like you're complaining about the roles women get to fill, rather than the pandering by film studios. You can also put women in roles traditionally played by men without it being pandering. If gender supposedly doesn't matter in your case then it shouldn't matter in our case either. \n\n Also if you don't think gender had a place in advertising movies in the past then you're living in a dream world. You're just used to men being the only ones catered to. I'm not going to sit here and call you sexist or anything but this whole post is just not a poignant or meaningful critique of the current media climate.

So the director let the actresses run away with the production on set and turned the movie into a series of improv skits. \n\nThis goes against the aesthetic of a classic Hollywood comedy which is all about filming a solid script. Airplane, Office Space, Groundhog Day, Shaun of The Dead, are all great comedies because they had solid execution of a movie idea that was already funny on paper not because the actors had zany ideas for queef jokes on set. The movie ended up more like a (not very good) version of an aimless, improv-driven movie like Borat or Anchorman. That can be okay but even if the improv was funny it wouldn't necessarily fit as a sequel to an all-time classic 80s movie.\n\nThe difference is Anchorman is funny but you don't believe that Will Ferrell is *actually* a news anchor. He's a funny guy saying funny things on a movie set. Whereas Office Space is funny and you *do* believe that Ron Livingston is a put-upon cubicle worker.\n\nHad nothing to do with casting women. Kate McKinnon is hilarious *in some things* but she needs direction and restraint. The director didn't have the discipline and authority to say \"Hey Kate, shut the fuck up and say the line, this is a movie not SNL.\"\n\nCheck out McKinnon in *The Spy Who Dumped Me*, she's much better there, but even in that movie it's like she's trying to steal the scene of an SNL skit instead of just acting her character.", "created_utc": 1572371329.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1572372346.0, "id": "f5q1xs9", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_doq6ej", "parent_id": "t1_f5pt0lv", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/doq6ej/id_rather_have_great_women_stories_than_lazy/f5q1xs9/", "score": 159, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Deggit", "author_id": "5gb9g", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Going off on a tangent here about the live action reboots because I just saw The Lion King on Broadway.

The 1940 picture included actor Pat O'Brien, who earlier in his career starred in...\n*  [The Front Page](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0021890/) (1931), which would later be remade as [His Girl Friday](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032599/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1) (1939). Speaking of Cary Grant pictures...\n* [Holiday](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0030241/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_45) (1938) is a remake of [Holiday](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0020985/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_140) (1930), with Edward Everett Horton playing the same character in both films. And if you weren't tired of Cary Grant being in remakes then you'll probably want to avoid...\n* [An Affair to Remember](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050105/) (1957), which is a remake of [Love Affair](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031593/?ref_=nv_sr_3?ref_=nv_sr_3) (1939). Director Leo McCarey and screenwriter Delmer Daves provided the same duties for both pictures. Speaking of a director making both the original and the remake...\n* [High Sierra](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0033717/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1) (1941) would later be remade into a western picture titled [Colorado Territory](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041253/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1) (1949) and were both directed by Raoul Walsh. The former picture was originally penned for the screen by legendary writer/director John Huston, who would later direct...\n* [A Farewell to Arms](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050379/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_28) (1957), which is a remake of the Gary Cooper-led [A Farewell to Arms](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0022879/?ref_=nv_sr_1?ref_=nv_sr_1) (1932). Aside from the fact that this was made into a [television mini-series in 1966](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0397787/?ref_=nv_sr_3?ref_=nv_sr_3) I should also note that the original work was a 1929 novel by Ernest Hemingway. Speaking of Ernest Hemingway novels being made into films...\n* [To Have and Have Not](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037382/?ref_=nm_knf_t1) (1944) was officially a film based off the book of the same name, although it shared little resemblance. The remake under the name [The Breaking Point](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0042281/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_3) (1950) would be much closer to the original novel. Interestingly enough, the same footage of a marlin trying to escape a fishing lure was used in both films. And because I keep having more fun information about remakes and this film, director Howard Hawks, who headed the earlier Bogey and Bacall picture, gave director John Huston the idea to use the Hemingway novel as the ending for his film [Key Largo](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040506/?ref_=tt_sims_tt) (1948), which also starred Bogey and Bacall.\n* Lastly, The Wizard of Oz has been remade a few times: there's the [1910 musical](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0001463/) based off the 1902 stage production, the [1925 version](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0016544/), and the ever-beloved [1939 version](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032138/) that most people think of today.\n\nThere are scores more, but I've been going at this for a while now and I'm pretty tired.

The review Red Letter Media did had a point in that it came out around the same time as the new Ghostbusters, also had a four person all female cast in the leads , but didnt get sold as some false woman empowerment film just because they \"could do any job a man can do\" , they were just doing their jobs and were also women. It does play into a part of the setup but isnt the point of the entire film. It just is that way and then you move on from there to a really amazing science fiction film that isnt just popcorn entertainment.", "created_utc": 1572376245.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "f5qeswv", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_doq6ej", "parent_id": "t1_f5plau9", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/doq6ej/id_rather_have_great_women_stories_than_lazy/f5qeswv/", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Protean_Ghost", "author_id": "2jnsjefn", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Adolescent me and friends pretty much rented that because Geena Davis was 90s teenage fap material.
