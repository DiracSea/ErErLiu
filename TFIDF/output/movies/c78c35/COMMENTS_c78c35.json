He holds alot of offensive campaign records.  \n  \nHe slapped a soldier and they took him out of combat which led to the early Normandy campaign being slow. Once Patton was put back in the pace picked up. Basically because of one soldier  being slapped they sacrificed the best commander. Incredibly dumb. \n  \nAlso people will probably bring up people like Cesar, ghengis khan, sun tzu, and Alexander the great. All of them lived in times when it was easier to command.  \n  \n First off many of their enemies were green to war and lacked officer school and knowledge of military tactics and history. Patton was facing veteran forces and commanders who were highly trained and knew all the modern tactics he had learned as well. I remind everyone that Montgomery lost alot to the Germans. In North Africa and in market garden. So one of the best commanders in the allied armies lost to the Germans regularly. Meanwhile Patton was undefeated. \n  \nSecondly Patton was using tank Calvary and army units against the German tanks and Rommel. He was outmatched but still won. With bad air support too.  \n  \nI point this out because lots of these other great leaders were helped by a technological advantage in their time. Cesar by Roman military organisation and tactics. Alexeander by the innovation of the phalanx. Ghengis khan by horse archers.  \n  \nPatton had no such technology advantage. In fact the German tanks were better, soldiers were more veteran, and Rommel was considered the best. \n  \nThird those historical commanders acted with pretty much supreme power. They answered to no one. They could kill their own soldiers and not face the media. Ghengis khan, sun tzu, Cesar, and Alexander all did acts of great brutality in inspire fear in their enemies or to ease their war by not having to deal with prisoners. They also could take slaves to help with manual labor. Today these are not luxuries a military commander has. They have rules about prisoners and their treatment as well as civilian populations. \n  \nPeople see Patton shooting the mules blocking the bridge as mean but 2 mules were blocking his entire advance. There's a higher importance at stake.  \n \n Meanwhile these other leaders slaughtered entire civilian populations and cities because they gave resistance.  \n  \nOverall I think if you put Patton at the head of an ancient army like any of those other leaders had he would have taken the world.", "created_utc": 1561910332.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1561911231.0, "id": "esev6ej", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_c78c35", "parent_id": "t1_ese6146", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/c78c35/in_1971_actor_george_c_scott_was_nominated_and/esev6ej/", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "nuck_forte_dame", "author_id": "7tfmb", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Soylent green is people.", "created_utc": 1561868673.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "esdu0f7", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_c78c35", "parent_id": "t1_esdtshn", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/c78c35/in_1971_actor_george_c_scott_was_nominated_and/esdu0f7/", "score": 335, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Zooropa_Station", "author_id": "dzsbi", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Negative.

I interviewed them through an interpreter. The visual evidence and the verbal testimony of starvation, cruelty and bestiality were so overpowering as to leave me a bit sick. In one room, where they [there] were piled up twenty or thirty naked men, killed by starvation, George Patton would not even enter. He said he would get sick if he did so. I made the visit deliberately, in order to be in position to give first-hand evidence of these things if ever, in the future, there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to 'propaganda'.\"\n\n  - Letter, DDE to George C.

The bestiality displayed there was not merely piled up bodies of people that had starved to death, but to follow out the road and see where they tried to evacuate them so they could still work, you could see where they sprawled on the road. You could go to their burial pits and see horrors that really I wouldn't even want to begin to describe. I think people ought to know about such things.
