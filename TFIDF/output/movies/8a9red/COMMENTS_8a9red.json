While there certainly is a good amount of violence in the movie, it never gets to the point of being either shocking or overly brutal \u2013 which severely limits its overall effectiveness. **What\u2019s more, so much emphasis is put on murder that it shortchanges the fact that all crime is legal in the world of The Purge. The rules of the film really allow for all kinds of psychotic chaos, but none of it is capitalized on effectively. Given the overall message from the larger metaphor at play, this is a series that should be effectively punishing the audience for finding brutality and horror entertaining, similar to the story\u2019s villains. but it never steps up to the plate.**", "created_utc": 1523029574.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1523046231.0, "id": "dwx2lps", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8a9red", "parent_id": "t3_8a9red", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8a9red/the_first_purge_official_poster/dwx2lps/", "score": 4382, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "SharksFan4Lifee", "author_id": "mgjfe", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Looks like Zack De La Rocha raging against some sort of \"machine\"", "created_utc": 1523028427.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dwx190a", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8a9red", "parent_id": "t3_8a9red", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8a9red/the_first_purge_official_poster/dwx190a/", "score": 2759, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "socialzero", "author_id": "4arbu", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I hate myself for liking these movies so much", "created_utc": 1523029569.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dwx2lhh", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8a9red", "parent_id": "t3_8a9red", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8a9red/the_first_purge_official_poster/dwx2lhh/", "score": 1733, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "fleminjo", "author_id": "6x97w", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "The movie might not be great, but the marketing for the movie has been top notch so far.", "created_utc": 1523024637.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dwwwz6l", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8a9red", "parent_id": "t3_8a9red", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8a9red/the_first_purge_official_poster/dwwwz6l/", "score": 1841, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "sfx", "author_id": "31l39", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "The Purginator: Sent back in time to preserve the Purge", "created_utc": 1523029623.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dwx2nur", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8a9red", "parent_id": "t3_8a9red", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8a9red/the_first_purge_official_poster/dwx2nur/", "score": 201, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "NytoSoflo2", "author_id": "mvv7bom", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I want to see an offshoot satire of the purge.
