The thing I loved about The Shining was that it was a cohesively thrilling story that wasn't just about the scares, but it was a story about alcoholism and the effect it has on families. It's not just shallow jump scares, but true psychological horror that slowly builds over time. It had a definite \"meaning\" to it and that theme was ever present, and gave you lots of food for thought.\n\nDoctor Sleep, on the other hand, is just not anywhere near as well-thought-out. It was certainly tolerable and had its interesting moments but the one thing it was lacking, to me, was a proper *theme*. It has cartoonish villains that don't really seem to represent anything, and the only major conflict in the story related to character development is more or less resolved in the opening chapters (Daniel not following in the footsteps of his father, vowing to be a better man).\n\nIMO it's really nothing more than fanservice for people obsessed with The Shining. It makes a boatload of references to the original but it plays out a lot more like an adventurous family blockbuster movie but with gore. Not so much a true successor to The Shining at all, in spirit or in quality.\n\nHearing who's behind making this adaptation makes me even less hopeful that it will end up good... Book was a light 3/5 and a definite disappointment for me, but not entirely terrible.

They know they may have to contend with a bunch of dudes, so they actually round up a posse, wild west style. Tension increased. We see the leader of the drillers, who is blatantly lying about being hit by a branch, since he's clearly been punched multiple times. Tension increased. We get the hostility of the one deputy who is clearly spoiling for a fight. Tension. And then we see his paranoia is justified, as it certainly seems like those drillers were flanking them...and all have their guns out...and are all wearing body armor...tension tension tension. And just like that, with a really amazing cut on the trailer door, we get into the flashback.\n\nThe flashback has warm colors and a happy tone. That tension that was built up is released. You see a happy couple, two beautiful people enjoying a fun night together. And then the drillers come back, and the tension slowly ramps up again. They're being rowdy. Pete is being persistent in that way drunk people are. The man's appeals to the head driller are ignored. Things get more heated, and we see the crime play out. the man is helpless to stop the woman from getting raped and she is helpless to stop him from being beat to death. So, you have ostensibly a mystery movie about solving a crime stop 60% of the way through and show you the entire crime being committed with no coyness, no attempt to obfuscate who did it. This is where the movie does its judo redirection. The entire emotional weight of solving this crime, setting right the lives of the woman's parents, finding closure for Renner's character, Olsen's character proving her worth and trying to manage the situation, all of that comes crashing back with an intense amount of immediacy, because now that we've seen the flashback, we know more than the main characters. We know they are in grave danger. And we know they're juuuust on the cusp of figuring it out, because holy shit do we not remember the little mexican standoff? That JUST happened. We're basically told, just before the lightning strikes, that the lightning is going to strike and all of the emotional *through questions* of the movie are about to be answered, in the next like 5 seconds.\n\nSo you get the main character arcs of the movie coming to a head, the renewed tension of the standoff now that we know the true stakes, AND we're riding high off the heart-rending tension of the flashback and having watched powerless as these men destroyed lives. And now the movie just holds this impossibly high note of tension for so long as Olsen is maneuvered into position in front of the door.... and them blam, it's all happening faster than you can even think. \n\nThe movie felt like it was made specifically to pull off this technique. Like instead of the technical stuff just being a vehicle for the script, it felt like the whole movie and story was plotted around choosing specifically this method for revealing it--tense situation, then flashback revealing the entire mystery, and then return to the tense situation with the audience now understanding the danger the characters are in more acutely than the characters. Then raise the tension just eeeeever so slightly more, then unload everything in a fast resolution. \n\nIf you watch Wind River and aren't going whaaat the fuuuuuck oh my goooood after the shootout, then I'm surprised.
