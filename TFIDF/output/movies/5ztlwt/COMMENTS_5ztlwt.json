Their explanation is even more idiotic. They claim that people use star ratings to rate films for others, but will use thumbs up/down to improve their own experience.\n\nIt makes no sense. If someone was rating films using star system trying to be objective, they will do the same with thumbs up/down.\n\nThey complain that some documentary on an important subject always gets 5 star rating, but people are often in the mood to watch Adam Sandler film that typically gets a 3 star rating, so star rating system was not helpful to those people.\n\nWell guess what? People will still unanimously give thumbs up to documentaries on important subjects and a good percentage of people will give thumbs down to dumb comedies.\n\nIf you want to watch a comedy you simply select comedies from the list of genres and then the only films you will see will be comedies. Problem solved!\n\nThere is a huge difference between a 3.5 star film and a 4.5 star one. If Netflix is going to erase that distinction, they will lose a big part of their advantage compared to other streaming services.\n\nIndependent or art-house films that comprise a big part of Netflix library vary greatly in quality and personalized star rating system was the only way to delve into those genres without getting consistently burned. \n\n4.5 star rating would give me at least 2 out of 3 chance that I would like or even love the film, while the only way to ensure that I would like a film rated below 4 stars was to chose something from a genre that was a safe bet for me.\n\nAnd that is another issue. Star rating system encouraged me to experiment and explore new genres. I would take my chances with a 4.5 star rated film in a genre new to me.\n\nBut with dumbed down thumbs up rating, I have no idea if a film is a 3.5 or 4.5 star one, and I definitely don't want to waste my time delving into a new genre with a 3.5 star film.\n\nScrew you, Netflix! Screw you!\n\nGiven their history of removing features from the interface, I am feeling very pessimistic that they back down, but unfortunately Netflix is the only company that provided such quality recommendation system, so on the off chance that they can be persuaded to change their minds, please contact them.

I like it that way. I'm disappointed they are changing the system. \n\nThe reality is, that a movie like Children of men, is very kickass, and worthy of 5 stars, but not something you want to watch over an over. But something brainless and stupid, and kind of shitty, but entertaining in a stupid way, is something you can throw on, just to have some TV going, or if you're going to sleep, or whatever. \n\nThe star ratings help to know if something is worth watching the *first* time. \n\nIf it's just thumbs up or down, I lose a way to help decide what to watch. \n\nNetflix usually makes changes for the better, but this would be a step backwards, imo.

They think simpler +/-1s aggrigated at scale will be as useful as fewer 5-star ratings aggrigated. They might be right (probably are), *but* I think they're going about it wrong for two reasons:     \n1. **They're upsetting some users** -- Netflix is great because they listen(ed) to customers. ITT, I'm mostly reading that people genuinely hate this idea for some very legitimate reasons. So, even if thumbs are better for data collection, it's clearly not universally preferred by users.      \n2. **They lose potential to get more insightful data** -- specifically, they lose the ability to collect that more insightful data from those users who are willing (and want) to provide it.         \nFurther, there's an obvious way to keep both. They just have to ask users if they want thumbs or stars. If they want thumbs, their ranking system can just count up and down thumbs as 4 and 2 stars, respectively. Netflix gets the best of both worlds; users are happy; they get more data from those who were less likely to provide it, and better data from those who do; and, data their data is still clean.       \n      \nEdit: better yet, they could default everyone to thumbs, and let power users go into their account settings and select stars. That way they don't have to ask anyone anything. Anyone who cares will just go into their settings.

Being nice, offering them what information I think they might need, etc. I would only rate lower if they had a bad attitude or it felt like I was inconveniencing them.  \nOn the same note, I hate when it comes to my review for my job. I work in a factory, no customer interaction, but we are still rated on a 1 to 5 for various categories. A 5/5 is you performed OVER your basic duties and responsibilities. It's very difficult to do MORE than my job at a factory, because if I start doing that I'm literally doing someone else's job, or putting myself out of things to do, which of course looks bad when I'm not doing anything. It's a shitty system to keep raises from getting too high.  \nThe only good thing is my employer is pretty open (to discussion at least) about your raise, so if you feel like it's not enough or a rating isn't very favorable when it should be, you can talk about it with your supervisor and at least make a case for yourself.
