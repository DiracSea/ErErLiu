Slenderman is also basically the perfect type of monster for putting him in the background of shots without being very noticeable, as that's kind of where the whole allure of the character started iirc, so there is a huge opportunity there to use that to make him feel present once things get going without him being directly shown and being based on jumpscares.  Like once shit starts going down you could just give him this presence like he's always watching them from afar to really unnerve the viewer, potentially without them even knowing why.  It's like how in It Follows there are a bunch of subtle things regarding the sets and how oddly it moves through seasons, or how in Insidious there are a few moments where there is straight up a figure in the edge of the frame but nobody in the movie notices and just walk past.  Small things that you don't consciously notice that contribute to a feeling of unease.  Slenderman would potentially be perfect for this.  Hell, I'm no afficonato of Slenderman lore but seeing some of the images where all those shadowy tendrils come out you could almost even make it sort of Lovecraftian in that he's this mysterious creature we don't learn about that just exists and seems to like observing humans with what looks like a shoddy attempt at giving itself a human form.\n\n...But the cynical part of my brain is telling me it's just going to be a generic monster-terroizes-teenage/adult-woman-in-her-house-by-the-woods and, like you said, a bunch of unnecessary backstory.

This is because the monsters or beings in Lovecraftian horror are supposed to be so impossible, so horrifying, to make the viewer so insignificant that they are driven insane. Due to the fact that it would be impossible to really accomplish this in a movie, showing a \"Lovecraftian\" monster generally undermines it because, well, it doesn't drive you insane.\n\nOn the other hand, when showing the monster in most horror movies undermines it it's because when you give a thing a very cgi (and not honestly overly terrifying) face it does indeed undermine whatever you had dreamed up for it.\n\n**However**, this is not always the case. For example one of the movies I always point to as a good example of, if not horror movies in general (though I personally like it) good monster design is The Void (2016). That movie has moments when you see some monsters near the very beginning of the film, but because of the well designed (and made via practical effects) creatures doesn't undermines the terror. \n\nThe later parts of the film are a better example of creating a more Lovecraftian terror (ie what the \"Void\" actually is). The Void can do Lovecraftian horror because the forces behind the events of the movie (the \"Void\" are never really defined more than abstractly, and even then not really until the very end. Tasteful CGI helps in this capacity, and the movie can do this more easily because it has a backbone of more practical, simply visually disturbing monsters caused by these forces. \n\nTo provide a counterpoint, Alien is a good example of a movie where the movie isn't undermined by showing the creature (because H.R. Geiger is quite good at what he does) yet isn't Lovecraftian horror. This is because while the alien is perfectly capable of killing the crew, it isn't supposedly immortal or world shattering, it's just scary enough that you the viewer observe that fact.\n\nTo provide a succinct example for people that haven't see one or more I give you [this video](https://youtu.be/6QFwo57WKwg) that traumatized me as a child.\n\nThe first part of the horror in here is because the monsters are visually disturbing,but it is just that, bloody disturbing. This is more your standard horror.
