The only one who comes close is Hulk, and even he\u2019s not quite at the same level of the above three.\n\nIn a similar vein, for villains, the three most recognizable are probably Joker, Magneto and Doc Ock, with a good chunk of Batman\u2019s rogues gallery coming in close behind and Spider-Man\u2019s close behind that.\n\nOverall, I think Batman winds up being the most iconic superhero across decades for a variety of reasons with Joker being his most iconic nemesis and by far the most iconic comic villain.\n\nGiven that, it\u2019s not terribly surprising. Villains already have a casting advantage in that they are usually one-offs, in film especially, and therefore big name actors don\u2019t have to commit to a franchise in order to play them. They also tend to have slightly more meat to work with and so something as high-profile as the Joker gets the attention of both casting directors to do it right and actors who are interested in doing something both interesting and recognizable in that sort of genre.\n\nOf any given villain, the Joker is going to get some of the strongest competition for the role and as a result get some of the strongest talent winding up playing him.", "created_utc": 1567031338.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "eyeb74o", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_cwmras", "parent_id": "t1_eyd7v49", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/cwmras/joker_final_trailer/eyeb74o/", "score": 13, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Muroid", "author_id": "11yed3", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Well I can tell you the people who typically wear joker and or joker and harley quinn apparel like their life depends on it are going to fucking hate it", "created_utc": 1567014670.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "eydaece", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_cwmras", "parent_id": "t1_eyd000z", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/cwmras/joker_final_trailer/eydaece/", "score": 245, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "WebHead1287", "author_id": "91arl", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Just the other day my friend and I were discussing how interested we were in this movie, and his wife came in and said \"Ugh why are they making an R rated Joker movie, nobody wants that\". \n\nGranted, I doubt she's the target audience and in general she much prefers upbeat, happy ending movies, but I definitely won't be surprised if this movie gets a polarizing reaction", "created_utc": 1567014993.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "eydawah", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_cwmras", "parent_id": "t1_eyd000z", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/cwmras/joker_final_trailer/eydawah/", "score": 57, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "kdawgnmann", "author_id": "77jqo", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Wouldn't be a DC film without a 50% on rotten tomatoes and people getting weirdly defensive about it both ways.", "created_utc": 1567017126.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "eydec51", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_cwmras", "parent_id": "t1_eyd000z", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/cwmras/joker_final_trailer/eydec51/", "score": 64, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "sgthombre", "author_id": "92cdm", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I thought for one second that he was watching The King Of Comedy when De Niro popped up as a comedian, only to realise quickly that he looked pretty old", "created_utc": 1567014962.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "eydaukx", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_cwmras", "parent_id": "t1_eyczlrf", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/cwmras/joker_final_trailer/eydaukx/", "score": 27, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Please everyone see the King of Comedy before watching this; it will probably be rewarding.", "created_utc": 1567013361.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "eyd8dm7", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_cwmras", "parent_id": "t1_eycyehj", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/cwmras/joker_final_trailer/eyd8dm7/", "score": 70, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Steakleather", "author_id": "8o3hn", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Vibes?
