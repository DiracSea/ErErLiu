As I said I'm not super familiar with Dune lore and as your comment points out the are a lot of similarities on the surface and yeah I agree that Tatooine is just a backdrop while Arrakis is the whole driving force of Dune.   \nI guess I feel like a lot of times these kind of things are brought up with books/movies/tv shows from any genre a lot of things are really just tropes from the genre, for example most fantasy wizards all wear similar clothes look similar etc. I also think it's easy to stretch things to make them sound identical when they just are just using the same trope. Of course it could be argued that Dune created many of the tropes, but is that plaigerism? Should Tolkien (or his estate) sue George RR Martin or David Eddings?\n\nIt's the same when songs are compared and said to be plaigerised, sometimes it's accurate, sometimes it's just that there are only so many ways that sound can be arranged.", "created_utc": 1554870602.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1554870789.0, "id": "ekiyec3", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_bbe7a5", "parent_id": "t1_ekiu30v", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/bbe7a5/david_j_peterson_who_crafted_the_dothraki_and/ekiyec3/", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "GreatSlothOfHoth", "author_id": "2uz8ukbc", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Well it was one of the first fictional desert planets in sci-fi granted, but there are lots of stories set on Mars that depicts it as a desert planet, Edgar Rice Burroughs 'A Princess of Mars' from 1912 for example.", "created_utc": 1554865258.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "ekislfq", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_bbe7a5", "parent_id": "t1_ekirxwh", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/bbe7a5/david_j_peterson_who_crafted_the_dothraki_and/ekislfq/", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "GreatSlothOfHoth", "author_id": "2uz8ukbc", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "But that just leaves training and the mostly off-screen war.", "created_utc": 1554873033.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "ekj0lzf", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_bbe7a5", "parent_id": "t1_ekiw63v", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/bbe7a5/david_j_peterson_who_crafted_the_dothraki_and/ekj0lzf/", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Duggy1138", "author_id": "uchwc", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Another similarity is that they can't use lasers because it would cause nuclear sized explosions when hitting a personal shield", "created_utc": 1554865861.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "ekitb93", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_bbe7a5", "parent_id": "t1_ekir86r", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/bbe7a5/david_j_peterson_who_crafted_the_dothraki_and/ekitb93/", "score": 41, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "KatalDT", "author_id": "746vd", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Paul is more Robb, then.

An example is that one of the characters is a traitor and literally the second mention of the character's name in the book is the Main Bad Guy boasting about how he has turned that character into a traitor. There is an undermining of suspense at every point in the book. It's not really an adventure story because the main character has already dreamed/prophesied the adventures he's going to have.\n\n2. **Vast amounts of the book take place internally.** Not just internal monologue but observation and intuition. The author delights in slowing down dialogue scenes and action scenes to show what each character is thinking about what the other person said. The 1984 movie has lots of corny voice-over narration, but what other cinematic way is there to be faithful to this aspect of the book?\n\n3. **It's a story, really, about aliens not humans.** Nearly every main character in *Dune* has some sort of ability that we would consider a superpower. Every mentat is a human supercomputer that could beat Watson at Jeopardy, every Bene Gesserit makes Sherlock Holmes look like Dr. Watson, then there's prana-bindu, the weirding way, prophecy, the Voice, folding space, the superhuman fighting abilities of Fremen and Sardaukar, etc. There are no relatable human characters in *Dune* because none of the characters are ordinary people.
