The \"New Math\" attempted to teach some of the more abstract concepts from modern algebra within a high school setting, as well as introduce different number base systems and stuff. \n\nOf course, the problem wasn't that \"they're changing math\", it was that they were teaching math that the parents hadn't learnt themselves, same for a lot of teachers (unfortunately). \n\nRe common core - I don't know enough about it, but I've read good things. And it seems that a similar \"I DIDN'T LEARN IT LIKE THAT JUST DO WHAT I DID\" thing is happening in a lot of places. \n\nI *have* seen videos such as the lady teachers testifying against common core in a local council meeting or something ( in america ), but I don't think that this is enough evidence against it. Perhaps the curriculum wasn't implemented very well there, I'm not sure ( I don't want to say that this lady, and those like her, don't have points). \n\nI think I recall reading Hung Wu talk positively about common core, as well as others (a chap called collin who writes dummies books and is active on reddit). \n\nSo, I hope that people are able to refrain from being so reactive and appreciate that reforming maths education isn't a bad thing. Why some people get so emotionally attached to stuff like a long division algorithm they can't even explain or derive I've no idea. \n\nThere are further steps necessary imo, such as a reduction in physics leaning topics and an increase in Statistics. Physics is relatively useless for most people but is still disproportionately used due to it's legacy (it was at the centre of many discoveries) and the curriculum that current curriculum's are based on. Much more beneficial to people and society would be having a foundation in statistics and logic. I really don't even remotely care if someone doesn't know how to re-write sin() in terms of cosine(). But I do think that it's important for someone to know whether a study makes any sense, or roughly what kind of sample size should be appropriate in studies they're presented with ( by newspapers etc) as facts. \n\n", "created_utc": 1523628472.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dxat2hk", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8bylwy", "parent_id": "t1_dxarqu0", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8bylwy/incredibles_2_new_official_trailer/dxat2hk/", "score": 117, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "greenteaformeplease", "author_id": "173f31", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I think they are actually talking about New Math which was introduced into US educational curriculum in the 1960s.

Why can\u2019t we see Frozone\u2019s wife?  Why can\u2019t we have a WOC Superhero?  We have plenty of yt pepo superheroes in the film, both men and women, young and old.  We even have a Man Of Color: Frozone, the Incredibles\u2019 sassy black sidekick and ice minstrel, coming to help his masters at their every beck and call.  But Frozone\u2019s wife?  Not only does this proud WOC not get to join the team and develop her own super powers, she doesn\u2019t even get seen on screen.  Why?  Is she too shapely for their little superhero team?  Does her naturally voluptuous figure somehow threaten the sexual appeal of twig-like yt woman Invisigirl?  Maybe it\u2019s time for a fat black woman superhero.  Also, can we talk for a minute about how Frozone\u2019s wife\u2019s entire character is nothing more than a single gag and not even a funny one at that.  The audience LAUGHS at this beautiful woman\u2019s pain as she just wants her husband, her man, to stay in with her and fulfill HER needs for once instead of going out and playing superhero with his yt friends.  The audience LAUGHS at her for trying to stand up for herself and express HER needs.  It\u2019s disgusting.  I walked out of the theater literally shaking with anger and pain for this poor Woman Of Color.  Trapped in her home while her husband is out with another woman (a yt woman nonetheless and her entire yt family).  Listen, I am not asking for much.  My request is very simple.  Disney/Pixar need to kill off all the yt Incredibles and introduce a new family of beautiful humans with a \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe little \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe more \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe melanin \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe in their skin.  Also, ditch the very aggressively yt european name \u201cThe Incredibles\u201d and change the last name to something more modern and ethnically sensitive for this new family: Something like the \u201cThose Fantassyquess\u201d or something.
