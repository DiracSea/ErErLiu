The guy went to Harvard. He is a Texan though and that's how Texans talk. Jimmy Carter had a similar problem in his day where he was depicted as a yokel peanut farmer. I think there is a bit of bigotry in it. Most of the big news companies are based up north and they likely people who talk and act like them. Probably one of Obama's biggest assets when running is that he was such a good orator and came across as cool and confident. So why can both succeed? Well America is a big place and values differ. In the south someone who seems approachable and friendly will be popular but someone who comes across as an academic will be seen as an elitist snob. In the north the opposite is true. A southerner would be seen as a dumb hillbilly and the academic will be a valued expert. You can see this with Clinton versus Bush Sr. Both are southerners but Bush spoke and acted like a Washington elite. Clinton was far more charismatic.
