Lego Batman is probably the only 3D-capable movie at our theatre right now, and since we know it's going to get and is getting lots of people, why not make all the showings 3D and rake in extra cash?

Movie theatres make 90% of their money on concession sales, but maximising box office sales is never a bad idea either. Not to mention that Movie Theatres don't always make all of the decisions for their showings, they make most of them, yes, but if a studio of a movie wants a movie to be shown a different way, or not shown in a certain way, it will be shown that way.
