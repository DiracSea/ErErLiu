The acting weren't too bad either if I remember correctly, having both Kurt Russell and Matthew Fox. Great setting and cowboy western world, bad use of over the top gore, that also all of my co-viewers found not only really nasty but downright stupid/ridiculous.\n\nSorry4rant but I think I need to let this out/share my take on this.\nThe director's definitely talented. And I'm glad he got the actors and recognition, with it being his first film, and it being released to cinemas long after initial release, BUT I just can't say I like it. (Kinda like From Dusk till Dawn. Loved the first half lol)\n=SPOILER=\nNot after the torture of the good guys, the mutilation, deaths, and grotesque, vile shit.\nI'll admit that I'm in the wrong, not being a fan of horror at all lol, but I guess I just wanna tell the people who are like me, that they might want to sit this one out. At least some of the scenes.\nGod, it wasn't even enough to cover my eyes.\nIf I hadn't been in shock from anxiety, and it being a social situation (and sitting in the front row) I would (*should) have walked out lol.\n\nAgain, sorry if this comes off as a diss, or an old man yelling at GTA-gamers iycmd.\nI'm 23, and I saw it 2/3 years ago. Love Dexter, God of War, even Hannibal despite its more gross shit :D\nI also saw Don't Breathe and found it an awful experience lol so yeah, I'm probably weak or at least among the faint of heart.\n\nLike I said the movie had some great cinematic art and wonderful scenes!\nCheers.", "created_utc": 1561060336.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "ernsx71", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_c2y5lf", "parent_id": "t1_erneld5", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/c2y5lf/first_poster_for_horrorwestern_the_pale_door/ernsx71/", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "DurgeOnReddit", "author_id": "108qbx", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Just looked for it on Netflix.
