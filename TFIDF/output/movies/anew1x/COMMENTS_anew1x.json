Of course an animated film has the advantage a live-action film doesn't, with the ability to go right back to the events from the previous film 15 years later. But that falls apart when the computer animation is far superior now and you could hear the changes in their voices. And the film itself just stands on its own legs and do very little with its material. \n\nFor instance 8 years in and you get so many possible character developments.\n\n- Mr. and Mrs. Incredible being the veterans of the old days. A contrast to how modern todays superheroes and supervillains are. Their kids are now the faces of today's world of superheroes. I can easily imagine Mr. Incredible trying to stay relevant.  \n\n- Violet (23) being an adult living in a flat and goes to College. Possibly a side-character in this installment. Extremely focused on school work (possible working with an MA thesis, a big science project or something lie that), but has distanced herself from the family to focus on her career. It fits with her introverted personality, but in the end she'll acknowledge a mistake she does in the beginning of the film and reunite with the family in the last act. \n\n- Dash (18) is a muscular, High school sports guy. Possibly thinks too highly of himself. Like Sully in *Monsters University*. It's a further step from his character in the original film and it has the chance to explore some cool areas.\n\n- Jack-Jack (8) is almost Dash's age and I think he is an interesting character. Insteadd of silly toilet humour we got in the film, we'd have a kid that hasn't mastered his powers yet. How is it  for him knowing that he could be the cause of their families death? What if he one day causes the house to burn up while he is asleep? I can easily picture Jack-Jack being the cause of the major crisis in the film and him blaming himself for it. Of course at the end of the film, he saves the situation, not by random like he did at the end of *The Incredibles*, but because he is now a master of his own powers.
