I've selected a few quotes:\n\n> C\u00fa Chulainn is an Irish mythological hero who appears in the stories of the Ulster Cycle, as well as in Scottish and Manx folklore. He is believed to be an incarnation of the god Lugh, who is also his father. His mother is the mortal Deichtine, sister of Conchobar mac Nessa. [...]\n\n> It was prophesied that his great deeds would give him everlasting fame, but his life would be a short one. He is known for his terrifying battle frenzy, or _r\u00edastrad_ (translated by Thomas Kinsella as \"warp spasm\" and by Ciaran Carson as \"torque\"), in which he becomes an unrecognisable monster who knows neither friend nor foe. He fights from his chariot, driven by his loyal charioteer L\u00e1eg and drawn by his horses, Liath Macha and Dub Sainglend. In more modern times, C\u00fa Chulainn is often referred to as the \"Hound of Ulster\".\n\nOn the comparison with other heroes:\n\n> C\u00fa Chulainn shows striking similarities to the legendary Persian hero Rostam, as well as to the Germanic Lay of Hildebrand and the labours of the Greek epic hero Heracles, suggesting a common Indo-European origin, but lacking in linguistic, anthropological and archaeological material. [...]\n\nOn its significance as a mythical figure:\n\n> The image of C\u00fa Chulainn is invoked by both Irish nationalists and Ulster unionists. Irish nationalists see him as the most important Celtic Irish hero, and thus he is important to their whole culture. [...] He is depicted in a mural on Highfield Drive, and was formerly depicted in a mural on the Newtownards Road, as a \"defender of Ulster from Irish attacks\". [...]\n\n> He is also depicted in murals in nationalist parts of the city and many nationalist areas of Northern Ireland. The statue's image was also used on the ten shilling coin produced for 1966. The 1916-1966 Survivors Medal and the Military Star for the Irish Defence Forces all have the image of C\u00fa Chulainn on their Obverse.", "created_utc": 1494658294.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1494662524.0, "id": "dhhznze", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6avwqt", "parent_id": "t3_6avwqt", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6avwqt/michael_fassbender_set_to_develop_an_epic_irish/dhhznze/", "score": 249, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "personalmountains", "author_id": "irgcn", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": ">Michael Fassbender\n\nSold.", "created_utc": 1494660864.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dhi0j49", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6avwqt", "parent_id": "t3_6avwqt", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6avwqt/michael_fassbender_set_to_develop_an_epic_irish/dhi0j49/", "score": 125, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "So the year after that 'King Arthur versus C\u00fa Chulainn' is going to be a thing?", "created_utc": 1494661643.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dhi0s9e", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6avwqt", "parent_id": "t3_6avwqt", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6avwqt/michael_fassbender_set_to_develop_an_epic_irish/dhi0s9e/", "score": 294, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "GodisanAstronaut", "author_id": "881xb", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "After his portrayal of Macbeth in the newest adaptation by Justin Kurzel, I look forward to every historically mythological film he might do.", "created_utc": 1494660455.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dhi0e58", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6avwqt", "parent_id": "t3_6avwqt", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6avwqt/michael_fassbender_set_to_develop_an_epic_irish/dhi0e58/", "score": 84, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Shukakumura", "author_id": "ofbpp", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "If Cu doesn't have blue tights and a red Gae Bolg...I'm outta here.

Pretty much a baddass.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_O%27Malley\n\nDuring a trip from Dublin, O'Malley attempted to pay a courtesy visit to Howth Castle, home of Lord Howth. However, she was informed that the family was at dinner and the castle gates were closed against her. In retaliation, she abducted the Earl's grandson and heir, Christopher St Lawrence, 10th Baron Howth. He was eventually released when a promise was given to keep the gates open to unexpected visitors and to set an extra place at every meal. Lord Howth gave her a ring as pledge on the agreement. The ring remains in the possession of a descendant of O'Malley and, at Howth Castle today, this agreement is still honoured by the Gaisford St. Lawrence family, descendants of the Baron.[29] (Commemorating these events, there is in Howth a street of 1950s local council housing named 'Grace O'Malley Road'.)\n\nThe legendary reason for O'Malley seizure of Doona Castle in Ballycroy was that the MacMahons, who owned the castle, killed her lover, Hugh de Lacy, the shipwrecked son of a Wexford merchant she had rescued. When the guilty members of the MacMahon clan landed on the holy island of Caher for a pilgrimage, O'Malley captured their boats. She and her men then captured the MacMahons and killed those responsible for her lover's death. Still not satisfied with her revenge, O'Malley then sailed for Ballycroy and attacked the garrison at Doona Castle, overpowering the defenders and taking the castle for herself.[20] Her attack against the MacMahons was not the first time she interrupted someone at their prayers. Legend tells of another chieftain who stole property from O'Malley and fled to a church for sanctuary. She was determined to wait out the thief, maintaining that he could starve or surrender. The thief dug a tunnel and escaped, however, and the hermit who took care of the church broke his vow of silence to scold her for attempting to harm someone who had sought sanctuary. Her reply is not recorded.[30]\n\nMore than 20 years after her death, an English lord deputy of Ireland recalled her ability as a leader of fighting men, noting the fame she still had among the Irish people.[31][32]\n", "created_utc": 1494670376.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dhi3bql", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6avwqt", "parent_id": "t1_dhhxtqu", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6avwqt/michael_fassbender_set_to_develop_an_epic_irish/dhi3bql/", "score": 47, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "confusedbossman", "author_id": "48zrt", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Not mythology but Gr\u00e1inne Mhaol with make a class Netflix series.", "created_utc": 1494668057.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dhi2o30", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6avwqt", "parent_id": "t1_dhhxtqu", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6avwqt/michael_fassbender_set_to_develop_an_epic_irish/dhi2o30/", "score": 8, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Not even closely familiar with the source mythology but I'll watch Fassbender in anything.
