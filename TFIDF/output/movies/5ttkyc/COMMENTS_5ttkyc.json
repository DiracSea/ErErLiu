As Vincent and Max tear into each other, Max becomes stronger and more assertive, ultimately culminating in his moment of improvisation at the end when he blindly opens fire at Vincent, knowing he has no other choice.\n\nVincent, on the other hand, begins to regress throughout the movie, in response to the stress of the mission, and ultimately the emotional weight that Max is giving him. In the final scene, he reverts back to his most basic instincts: shooting a Mozambique drill center mass at Max.\n\nExcept...at the moment they confront each other for the final time, a subway door is in the way between them. Vincent fires his typical picture-perfect triple tap, and all three rounds are stopped by the doorway. Max, on the other hand, blindly sprays fire at Vincent and scores a hit \"outside the box\", when one of the rounds goes through the glass and nails Vincent in the side. Max wins precisely because his lessons in improvisation have finally taken root, while Vincent drops the reload mag as he realizes he's lost, and sees no point in continuing.\n\nBy all rights, Vincent was physically and tactically capable of completing that reload and finishing off Max (who had an empty H&K USP - Vincent's pistol that he adopted, in another symbol of their trade in viewpoints), but chooses to stand down and stop the fight because there's no more point, he knows he's dying. In those final moments both men recognize each other for who they are, fully understand the other, and feel sympathy. Much like Heat, the true weight of the story lies in the mutual respect between the main characters. Even as one lies dying, the bond between the protagonist and antagonist in both films is still the most powerful and meaningful connection either has ever made, and the survivor in both films feels naked regret at the loss of the only person in their lives who truly mattered.\n\nAnd that's the sort of shit that's utter Greek to directors like Michael Bay or JJ Abrams.", "created_utc": 1487034414.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "ddpnecj", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_5ttkyc", "parent_id": "t3_5ttkyc", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/5ttkyc/in_the_alley_scene_in_collateral_tom_cruise/ddpnecj/", "score": 31, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "ArbiterOfTruth", "author_id": "92sl4", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I don't think I've ever met a person who has seen Collateral and didn't like it.

They sound like firecrackers, POP POP POP.  If supersonic, then you also get a \"SHRAK\" sound that varies greatly depending on where you are in relation to the shot.  Also, if you're close enough with the mic to get it loud,, you're probably going to clip as a single mic simply can't handle the dynamic range required.  Double that if your audience has no idea what gun shots really sound like.   Don't even get me started on silencers. \n\nA good case is for faking it is the gunshots in Terminator 2.  The DVD features in the special ginormous edition show a ton of the work that went into it.  Arnie's shotgun is a shotgun mixed with a cannon, and some other crap.  In this case it isn't supposed to be realistic.  It's supposed to sound awesome.  They even slowed down the minigun sounds because they were worried that it fired so fast it would sound \"wrong\" to audiences.

They were for over 21 students, so we had a large variety of people there. Anyways, the ex-con that lived there had a HUGE, like, think bigger than American History X, swastika on his chest. He had other white power symbols on him too and was also bald, ya know, to really drive the point home.\n\nHe was actually a really nice and friendly guy. He told us that, \"When you're doing a long time, you have to have friends. It's impossible to deal with shit without a group to lean on. So, I figured it was easier to join the white group than the black one.\"\n\nWhich, may or may not be bullshit. Anyways, one night, him and his roommate had gotten into a shouting match while they were out at a club and ended up, outside my room, with their shirts off, crying. It was... awkward. \n\nWell, at one point they yelled for me. Which, was absolutely fantastic. Because I really wanted to be a part of the NAZI cry-time hour. \n\nWhile I was out there, listening to them basically keep saying, \"I'm sorry man!\" to each other. (Yes, alcohol was 100% involved.) A group of black students that lived on the upper floor pulled up. Our little pow-wow was blocking the stairs. So, they sat in their car for upwards of an hour, waiting on this big 230 lb. white supremacist to get out of their way.\n\nEventually, I went and pecked on their window, at the request of the skin head, (I am very much **not** intimidating and also knew them well.) and told them, \"Guys, don't worry about him, he's just an ex-con that doesn't have any ill will towards any race. He's having an emotional breakdown. If you're wanting to go to your room, there won't be any problem.\" \n\nThey, of course, acted like they weren't worried about him. Which, also, may or may not have been true. I wouldn't want to be seen as scared of someone like that either. Yet, after I told them that, they did go to their room, without incident. \n\nI finally ushered the two man-fountains to their room and got back to sleep. Yet, I'll never forget the sight of that big bald white dude with that big black swastika on his chest, crying his eyes out and apologizing to black people.
