He told me some stories you wouldn't believe. Some were only recently declassified. \n\nEdit: Here you go. He was very matter of fact in the way he talked, we went here, we did this, but he described scenes that stuck with him over the years that he could never forget. After D-Day he said he was angry and stayed angry for this rest of the war. The only thing he could do to get rid of the anger was to get drunk. One scene  he described was on a small island off Japan. After a long night of firefights he watched the sun rise on a pristine beach that he said sparkled like diamonds. On the beach lying where they fell were hundreds of dead Japanese soldiers bloated and filled with gas from exposure to the hot sun. He said they walked through the dead bodies popping their stomachs like balloons with their bayonets and laughing. He thought it was crazy that they were laughing. As he walked on down the beach he saw an emaciated Japanese man in a bamboo cage pleading with the soldiers to free him. Someone explained that on that tiny island the local villagers put criminals in cages until they died of hunger or exposure. After the fall of Berlin he was given a stack of dossiers profiling high ranking Nazis with names, ranks and portraits and patrolled border crossings to catch them trying to escape Germany. He was issued a .22 caliber pistol and unofficially ordered to positively identify them and execute them on the spot and he said he did with no regrets. He said one Nazi officer was dressed as a woman wearing makeup hoping he wouldn't get caught. I asked him how he knew and he said the adams apple gave him away. He made him wipe the makeup off, matched his face with the profile and the man admitted he was the man in the picture so he shot him in the head. During and after the war he became a severe alcoholic and said he got help when one day he looked in the mirror and was literally crying tears of blood. He remained sober until he died and helped a lot of people. He was one of the signposts that helped me start making a big U-turn back to life. I miss him.

The point of that scene was that war is a fucking ugly enterprise.  In a perfect world should the soldiers have shot them?  No.  In the real world did the soldiers shoot them?  Yes.  And realistically the only thing that should be happening is it's time to move on.\n\nThe opening scene of Saving Private Ryan gives a visceral sensory overload like no other, about how once the battle begins the engine has left the station and things are going forward at a pace that is too fast and convoluted to sit down and seriously consider.  \n\nThe scene almost feels like a trap, to get people to pull themselves out of the moment and see if it sunk in well enough that war is chaos and hellish and terrible, or if they're too distracted by how they think things \"should\" go.  That scene was war in a nutshell, and why things we as a civilian could balk at, but we have to give a little more allowance to in the heat of things.\n\nIn this perfect world where all things are being equal and we have the time and the convenience of intense moral scrutiny those two soldiers should have been clapped in irons for what they did.  But they weren't living in that perfect world, they were living in the hellish meat grinder of Omaha Beach, where their senses and adrenaline were so unbelievably overloaded that when those boys got up that cliff *someone* was going to die.\n\nAnd in a certain way there's a completely naive, disrespect that comes with expecting people to get to the top of that bluff and not kill someone.  It sounds crude and evil and oh so awful, but there's a superhuman satisfaction, an overpowering *need*, to get up there and release the pent up energy brought on by what you just went through.\n\nFor hours they were on that beach at the peak of anxiety, fear, and stress, watching their friends get mowed down.  Their world was one of emotional hyperbole at that moment, where the entire world was red and noise, they were thirsty and starving for a meal of blood and vengeance.  Their hands were shaking when they got to the bluff with the inhuman realization that they were actually alive and what's more they were mere inches away from the sons of bitches that had just put them through the worst moment of their lives.\n\nThat means when someone comes out someone is going to get shot.  The troops that got up there needed that and the worst thing possible would be to chastise the soldiers because in the heat of battle they didn't one hundred percent follow proper protocol during the height of a battle.\n\nIn addition, there's also the metric that it's incredibly unreasonable to expect, as anyone on the *Heer* side of the fence, to think that you get the opportunity to throw grenades and artillery at people coming up a beach for hours and pepper them full of MG42 fire with one of the most anxiety inducing sounds on the planet (seriously, look up the sound of an MG42 and realize that it may be one of the most intimidating sounds on the planet), then think the second they get up there you get to be safe because you throw your hands up.\n\nWar is that moment where a bunch of people sitting around tables with perfect reason ask for stronger men in between them to collide into an emotional, violent mess, which means that the lines of cohesion begin to break down and allowances for what we would consider in any other situation to be \"poor behavior\" need to have a certain degree of allowance.  \n\nWhen you ask men to eat bullets for breakfast while their feet are shriveling under cold salt water and their muscles are aching from carrying 30-60 pounds of gear up a freezing bluff we owe it to them as humans to allow some of their inner monster to take in during the height of the frenzy.  If that's not a dog we are ready to let off the leash then we aren't ready to go to war in the first place, that's one of the solemn things we need to consider as a consequence of declaring war.  It's not a good thing or a bad thing, it's one of the things that comes with war and one of the consequences we have to weight when we make the decision.\n\nSaving Private Ryan is full of those little things and is where I think it starts to stand out.  All the ways we try to beautify war out of fear of the media lens that Kronkite popularized in Vietnam is an unreasonable standard that we impose on soldiers while asking them to endure the most terrible thing a human being can endure.\n\nI had no problem on a moral level with the fact that the soldiers on the beach were satisfied with the roasting of the machine gun nest and held their fire to enjoy it for a moment.  Good or bad at the end of the day that was a satisfaction they needed in that moment.  I had no problem with the fact that the first soldier to throw up his hands when the GIs got into the trenches got shot in the chest because of the chaos of battle.  I have no problems that the two Czechs were shot because the GIs had neither the time nor interest in scrutinizing who they and their intentions were.  \n\nOn the same note I have no qualms with the fact that the machine gunner shot Wade.  I have no problems with the fact that some of them wanted to shoot Steam Boat Willy.  I have no problems with the fact that Miller denied them that opportunity, even if I appreciate that they had a point in wanting to do so.\n\nIn Ramel I have no problems with the fact that the grenadiers were using point blank shots to finish off wounded American soldiers during the height of the melee, because the battle was ongoing and soldiers on the ground still represented a threat and needed to be dealt with.  I had no problems with the Germans lighting up a messenger because as long as his lungs still had breath he was carrying the message.  I had no problems with Steamboat Willy shooting Miller.\n\nI had no problems with the bloody, exhausted, and frightened tank driver trying to open his hatch and no mercy being given, instead opening his hatch only to find several muzzles of Garands waiting for him that blew his face into shreds.\n\nWar is an ugly enterprise and we can't sanitize it.\n\nStrangely, of all the films that summed up my views on the ugliness of how the Czechs were dealt with it was Tombstone, which I think did a surprisingly, magnificent job of portraying a character who felt the same way I did.  Wyatt Earp (by Kurt Russell) spent the entire film playing at being a pacifist because he was familiar with the ugly, inhuman side of conflict.\n\nBut when the shootout at the OK Corral commenced it was time for full committal.  When Ike Clanton threw himself on his knees at the outset, Wyatt Earp yelled, \"The fight's commenced, get to fightin' or get away.\"\n\nThat is precisely how I feel about the people that expected clemency as soon as their defenses failed to hold on D-Day.", "created_utc": 1487172614.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "ddrzltk", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_5u7480", "parent_id": "t1_ddrx8qo", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/5u7480/in_saving_private_ryan_the_two_german_soldiers/ddrzltk/", "score": 636, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "fiction_for_tits", "author_id": "x1kzv", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "While you're right that they shouldn't have shot them, what the movie didn't show was that those guys were actually on the beach for about an hour.

The Jewish character is witty/opinionated and is clearly a bit closer to Vin Diesel's character. Reiben (the guy who survives at the end), is the cocky New Yorker who isn't afraid to banter with Tom Hanks (which sets up his insubordination later, making it more realistic). Sgt. Horwath is clearly the one who keeps the others in line and is very loyal to the Captain (again setting up his argument with Reiben later). The joke about not knowing Tom Hank's personal history is first presented (I think). All this is conveyed in a few minutes of dialogue. \n\nWithout this effective dialogue, we know essentially nothing about the characters leading up to their deaths and what they go through.\n\nAs for other dialogue throughout the movie. I thought there was some great stuff in the overnight Church scene, and the dialogue between Private Ryan and Captain Miller before the final battle is great.\n", "created_utc": 1487178562.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dds4qp0", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_5u7480", "parent_id": "t1_dds0iab", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/5u7480/in_saving_private_ryan_the_two_german_soldiers/dds4qp0/", "score": 12, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Bonjourno", "created_utc": 1487182071.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dds7xo8", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_5u7480", "parent_id": "t1_dds7l8z", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/5u7480/in_saving_private_ryan_the_two_german_soldiers/dds7xo8/", "score": 27, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "MicroGravitus", "author_id": "4uklp", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I can understand it, but there is an accent to the way he speaks.", "created_utc": 1487183094.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dds8v5y", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_5u7480", "parent_id": "t1_dds7wxb", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/5u7480/in_saving_private_ryan_the_two_german_soldiers/dds8v5y/", "score": 8, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Zendude123", "author_id": "3radf", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "\"Look, I washed for supper!\"", "created_utc": 1487174324.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dds11ds", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_5u7480", "parent_id": "t1_dds0n7e", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/5u7480/in_saving_private_ryan_the_two_german_soldiers/dds11ds/", "score": 65, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "karmacow", "author_id": "6swpy", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "You will be fine unless you are up against the Germans.\n\nFrom what I understand they are sticklers about grammer", "created_utc": 1487202684.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "ddsq5d4", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_5u7480", "parent_id": "t1_ddsakm6", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/5u7480/in_saving_private_ryan_the_two_german_soldiers/ddsq5d4/", "score": 10, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "TimeTravelMishap", "author_id": "54y3i", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "It can also be slapping/spanking.
