All-powerful gems, literally called infinity stones. So you could infer from that, alone, that they would be used to bring everybody back.\n\nBut let's say that you're also really, really stupid.

Let's pretend you're basically a vegetable that can watch movies and grunt. Your family has grown to resent you because you're a drain on them, emotionally and financially. You can't take care of yourself, so they have to hire a nurse to turn you over occasionally to prevent bedsores, spoon soup into your drooling mouth, and press play on Netflix for you. More than a few times, your brother has stood in the stairwell and stared at you sitting across the room, your eyes glazed over, emotionless, and he's felt a rage burning inside him. At you, for being the way you are. At God, for making you this way. At himself, for having these violent urges. He drinks a lot. Sometimes he thinks he's having a good day, but suddenly he punches a hole in the wall and doesn't even understand why he did it. You start to hear the voices of his wife and kids less and less often. He owns a gun. The last time the nurse came around, she put on Avengers: Infinity War, and set it to repeat automatically, because she wouldn't be coming back anymore. Your back kinda hurts. Your fluids IV has been empty for a while, but you don't know for how long. You can't remember the last time you heard any noises from upstairs.
