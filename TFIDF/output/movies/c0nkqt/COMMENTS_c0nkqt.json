Dystopian doesn\u2019t just mean \u201ca state that isn\u2019t good from humans\u2019 perspective\u201d, it means a civilization that is still extant and holding together, but miserable due to crime, consumerism, or totalitarianism.\n\nExtinction, replacement or devolution are something other than dystopia. Same goes for _The Time Machine_, I think. I\u2019m not sure that we see much of a miserable humanity, only a devastating war with lava bombs or something. And then we see the Eloi and Morlocks, who are something sub- or post-human instead of humans under a soul-destroying state.\n\nGranted there are fuzzy edges. The Epsilons in _Brave New World_ are similar to the Eloi or _Apes\u2019s_ humans. But most of the suffering people are \u201clike us\u201d mentally.\n\nDystopian is _Mad Max_ 1, Oceania, Panem, or Rapture before its collapse. Apocalyptic is _Armageddon_ or _Independence Day_ or _Dr. Strangelove._ Post-apocalyptic is the _Mad Max_ sequels, _Fallout_, _The Last of Us_ and can overlap with dystopias like Panem or city-states run by Negans maybe. Post-post-apocalyptic is when a new world has grown up and doesn\u2019t really think of itself as being after an apocalypse but just being its own thing, like the Eloi and the Morlocks, _Turn A Gundam_, maybe _Nausic\u00e4a of the Valley of the Wind_, and I\u2019d say _Planet of the Apes._ Maybe Waterworld too, didn\u2019t they kind of forget about land and just become accustomed to life on the water indefinitely?\n\nBut the pastoral post-post-apocalypse seems mostly Japanese. Those I listed, and then _Mega Man Legends_, _Xenogears_, maybe _Humanity Has Declined_ although that\u2019s before an apocalypse proper has happened. But post-post-apocalypses are great, there\u2019s something very dreamy about them, even more so than your _Omega Man_ scenario where the amusement parks haven\u2019t rusted away and the survivors can use them all to themselves.\n\nPost-post-apocalyptic amusement parks?

Also, the whole Big Brother surveillance-state thing is just mind-blowing foresight for the 1940s.\n\nMinority report (the movie) is pretty silly, but gets a lot of the technology right. But for a more prescient dystopia, I would suggest another PKD work: A Scanner, Darkly (the book, not the movie, though the movie is okay).\n\nMy vote for most incredible dystopian prediction in a work of fiction, however, definitely goes to \"[The Machine Stops](http://books.ebooklibrary.org/members/blackmask_online/machstop.pdf)\" by E.M. Forster, written in goddamn *1909*. It predicts the Internet. It predicts the social isolation of mass communication. It predicts the slow sacrifice of human autonomy to automated systems. It predicts the learned helplessness that comes from instant access to infinite information. It predicts social media and the way that it could create new forms of tribalism, while amplifying the most fringe voices. And it basically predicts the apocalypse that many feared would happen if the worst case Y2K scenario had come to pass.\n\nIt's really a must-read.", "created_utc": 1560548671.0, "distinguished":

That bitch of a mom could have had him like, decommissioned, but instead she thinks she's somehow \"saving\" him by dropping him off in the woods and telling him to fuck off forever. Itd be like if your dog had rabies and instead of putting him down, you drive somewhere and \"set him free\" and then forget about it.  Too bad he'll never understand that really, he dodged a bullet.

I remember hating the brother character (named Martin) bc he was such a little prick to David, but i was more sympathetic towards his character watching it recently. Martin's reaction upon meeting David makes sense: his rich asshole parents thought he was gonna die, so they fucking replaced him. Hes understandably jealous and angry as he tries to get David in trouble. During the scene at the pool party where the other douchebag rich kids are treating David like a machine, Martin actually gets a little protective. Theyre trying to see if he has a dick, and Martin is telling them to cut it out (the behavior, not the dick). Since this is the first time we see Martin accepting David and treating him like he would a person I think it was done intentionally to demonstrate David's misunderstanding due to programming flaws. The next thing that happens is one of the d-bag boys wants to \"test\" if David has certain pain receiving programming. He says \"im not gonna hurt you\", and then, as Martin protests, he pokes David with a knife. Davids programmed immediate response is to hide from the pain/seek out the nearest person who will provide protection, which in this case is his brother, hold on to them, back away, and repeat the phrase \"keep me safe (Martin)\".  Of course dissaster ensues: his reactions are meant to mimic the behavior of a child. If he was holding on to an adult it would have been fine, but hes holding onto his 11-12 year old brother who is smaller than David is, and Martin can't break his grip.
