Two Christmases ago I come across an usher being shouted at in my back hallway, by a lady, accompanied by her mother and two sons, pointing in his face. I approached and asked what the problem was. Long story short, in the sold out theatre, this lady and her family were sitting in a handicapped companion seat and we had a guest in a wheelchair that wanted to sit next to his wife. So, as per policy and the Americans with Disabilities Act, the usher asked them to relocate (it even says on the back of the ticket that management reserves the right to seat you where we see fit). This lady wanted nothing to do with it. She was causing a scene, and I calmly explained this policy to her, and offered to put her in any movie she wanted to see for free, get her a refund, and give her some more passes to come back another day. She yelled some more, said she wanted a refund, and we began walking through the lobby. \n\nI need her physical ticket stubs to be able to give her the refund, so I asked \"Can I see your ticket stubs?\" And she lost her shit again, middle of the lobby \"YOU THINK I DON'T HAVE TICKETS?! YOU THINK I JUST SNUCK IN HERE!!!!!!!\" I explained that NO, I just needed them to give her the refund and she stops in the middle of the lobby, and at the top of her lungs screams \"YOU RUINED MY CHRISTMAS! YOU ASSHOLE!!!\" And everyone in this packed lobby looks at me...like I ruined her fucking Christmas. \n\nI got her the refund, and while standing outside of the box office window she starts telling people in line that I'm an asshole and that \"this place is a disgrace\" and no one has any context, it's Christmas, so everyone is looking at ME like I'm some bad guy. She gets her refund, and on the way out one of her sons stares me down as he walks backwards through the door and slams his large Coca-Cola on the floor. \n\nWorking at a movie theatre, in my opinion, can be shittier than working retail. In busier theatres like mine, it's not uncommon that the concessionists and ushers don't leave the building until 3-4am. As a manager I'm sometimes there till 6am doing paperwork, inventory, etc.\n\nPlease be kind to your cinema employees. :)", "created_utc": 1482710136.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dbmltnz", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_5k91hs", "parent_id": "t3_5k91hs", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/5k91hs/to_all_fellow_cinema_employees_good_luck_today_is/dbmltnz/", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "yes_istheanswer", "author_id": "5n5dd", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I'm American and I had no idea going to the movies on Christmas was a thing.

I was regular staff at the time. \n\nCorporate didn't let us cancel shows from the 9 o'clock set, so we were unable to seat people early for the midnight premiere. \n\nI was an usher and was tearing tickets.  I was the gatekeeper keeping people in the lobby until theaters were cleaned. \nThe **ENTIRE** lobby was filled with people.  I would look out, and all I would see was a sea of heads.  \n\nThere was **no** distinction between people standing for concessions and those waiting for the movie.  It was just one giant mass.  At one point a fellow employee was sent out to separate concessions from those waiting to get it, but he was just engulfed by the monster. \n\nAs theaters dropped and got cleaned, we would let people in.  Everyone would push , of course.  Not everyone could be contained. \n\nEventually we got enough theaters open to empty the lobby 3/4 of the way.  But sure enough, it just filled back up to the insane capacity.  \n\nThen it emptied again and filled up half way.  Then it just trickled through. \n\nIt was the most hectic I have ever seen.   We played the movie in all 14 theaters, I think.   They were all almost sold out.
