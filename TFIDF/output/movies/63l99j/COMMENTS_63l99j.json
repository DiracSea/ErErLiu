However, the movie doesn't follow a conventional dramatic format in that it takes some unusual twists and turns; he returns home to a dramatically changed environment where the US has suffered some sort of \"attack\" and his overriding concern is to find and return to his family (with a strong emphasis on his son and the importance of his relationship with him). \nIn a larger sense, however, it is (as previously noted) about PTSD and how people suffering from it are often living in plain site and, sadly, become lost in society; often being misdiagnosed with other illnesses or suffering in silence until something tragic occurs.\nIt's surprising well acted; the supporting cast is quite good, and in spite of LaBeuofs real life shenanigans, he is generally considered a pretty fine actor. His performance will probably go unnoticed and under appreciated in this film.
