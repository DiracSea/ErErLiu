They tried to compete with American natural gas by lowering prices and waiting for the \"trend\" to come to an end. It didn't. They're now starting the process of liberalization with help from the US in order to make sure that their economy doesn't come to a screeching halt when oil dries up. They're diversifying what is offered there. The US is given access to Saudi markets in a really big way in exchange for liberal social reforms (women's rights, access to media) and acceptance/cooperation with Israel.

He was living in a time when certain forbidden acts such as praying to saints, worshiping idols, were considered acceptable within society. Abd al-Wahhab being the fundamentalist that he was, was completely against anything other than the Koran (word of god) and the Hadiths (sayings of the Prophet). So he made a religious-political pact with the leader at that time Muhammad ibn Saud aka Ibn Saud patriarch of present day Saudi dynasty, who was the Emir of Diriyah (later becoming Saudi Arabia) that he as a ulema (scholar of the religion) would legislate the ummah (muslim community) while Ibn Saud would handle the day to day politics needed from a leader.  He helped him consolidate his territory and the Ibn Saud would create alliances with his family members where power would be shared, which is how they have ruled since minus the new crown prince who has consolidated power. That agreement has for the most part been abided by ever since.\n\n What happened after the Grand Mosque Seizure was more of a doubling down from the Saudis rather than implementing anything new. Many thought the attacks would give the King and the royal family the opportunity they needed to finally take the domestic power back from the ulama but Khaled much like any saudi royal was smart enough to realize the ramifications of acting against the religious scholars in a country holding the 2 holiest cities in Islam. Plus they've always lived by double standards, regular citizens having to abide by strict laws where it is publicly known that many royals drink, have female entertainment, etc. As long as they kept that part of their lives relatively hidden from the Saudi public the Ulama would pretend it never happened. Hate to break it to you but there wasn't a liberal revolution in Saudi Arabia like there was in Egypt or Iran, that would have taken a secular government which never existed.

The US wanted to see the Russia-aligned Assad gone, so a lot of cash was poured into support of rebel groups, often consisting of extremists. A lot of those groups defected to ISIS. And the extreme destabilization of the country again provided fertile grounds for shit like ISIS.\n\n5) Saudi Arabia.

Practices varied widely from one part of the Dar-ul Islam (Islamic world) to the other so much so that Ibn-e-Batuta who traveled across the Islamic world in the Middle Ages, commented on the the variance in practices. They were depicting the Prophet in miniatures in Islam in Persia while such depictions were forbidden by Arabian rulers. It's just a ridiculous notion to suggest that until Abd-al Wahab came along, millions of Muslims were praying to idols and switched tracks, when Islam had spread all the way to Indonesia by that point.

My point is that veneration can take different forms. In Pakistan, where I'm from, it's true that some people truly do treat saints as intermediaries but by and large, educated Muslims only go to those shrines to pay respect to people who were instrumental in spreading Islam to the region. Whether that constitutes idolatry or not may be a matter of debate for some (I for one don't think it does) but no way do the Muslims who hold those views consider it to be idolatry. \n\nFrom a secular perspective, Wahabiism is similar to evangelical or puritanical movements within Christianity that came about as a response to what people felt was a Catholic Church straying from Christianity. It's one thing if Wahabis believe that that was the case and Abd-al Wahab saved Islam from the brink of idolatry, but one should acknowledge that the rest of the Muslim world doesn't necessarily agree with that logic. At some point all religion boils down to the other sect is wrong and my sect is right and to me, outright saying that before Wahabiism, the Muslim world was practicing idolatry, falls in the same category. I don't think it's quite as black and white as that. \n\nOn another note, I think that saying that Wahabiism is responsible for militant Islam is also ignoring the nuances of the situation.

Well to be fair those students probably came from a really rich family, oil sheikh or something considering they study geology. Because from what I've heard Oman is much more progressive than Saudi.\n\n\n\n", "created_utc": 1513027186.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1513027410.0, "id": "dr3qwd2", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7j1fnl", "parent_id": "t1_dr3l1lv", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7j1fnl/saudi_arabia_lifts_35year_ban_on_cinemas_movie/dr3qwd2/", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "TheGreatXavi", "author_id": "dq2m2", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "TIL [Australia has camels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_feral_camel) and they are a big problem because they aren't native and the population is getting to big.", "created_utc": 1513014711.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dr3eo22", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7j1fnl", "parent_id": "t1_dr3c65f", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7j1fnl/saudi_arabia_lifts_35year_ban_on_cinemas_movie/dr3eo22/", "score": 21, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "LostWoodsInTheField", "author_id": "yqlex", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Can't wait for Fallout: Land of Oz", "created_utc": 1513019950.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dr3jtht", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7j1fnl", "parent_id": "t1_dr3c65f", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7j1fnl/saudi_arabia_lifts_35year_ban_on_cinemas_movie/dr3jtht/", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "sharpshooter999", "author_id": "14ck4s", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Drop camels, man...they're vicious.", "created_utc": 1513031610.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dr3v522", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7j1fnl", "parent_id": "t1_dr3c65f", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7j1fnl/saudi_arabia_lifts_35year_ban_on_cinemas_movie/dr3v522/", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "quinbotNS", "author_id": "8ugukyp", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I hope not too.

If there's one country in the middle east to visit its Oman. Progressive, beautiful and idyllic landscapes. Of course I lived there before tourism boomed but it is a country with rich history and a progressive sultan, qaboos. He may be dead now I can't remember. I live in new Zealand now and I still think Oman is more beautiful so maybe that tells you something? The people were lovely, my mum wore basically what she was wanted as well. Loads of expatriate people there and amazing amenities. The intercontinental hotel was amazing! Everytime we went camping we were the only ones there, it was incredible to grow up there from 94 to 00. Then we moved to Saudi for 3 years and that was different, we lived in a compound on the school grounds, still a beautiful country but daily life was fairly sheltered in the compound.
