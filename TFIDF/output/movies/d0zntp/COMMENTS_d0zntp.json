You fail to mention that Todd Philips also directed The Hangover (1) which was fairly well acclaimed. He also has an Academy Award nomination under his belt for Adapted Screenplay of Borat. It's not like he was just some amateur who all of a sudden created a masterpiece. He was already talented.\n\nIt's not unlikely he worked on The Hangover sequels because The Hangover (1) made $470 million on a $35 million budget and Todd Phillips was aware he could make some quick cash. Can't really blame him. The Hangover 2 made $585 million on a $80 million budget, The Hangover 3 made $360 million on a $100 million budget.\n\nI wouldn't say he \"came out of nowhere\".", "created_utc": 1567898128.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1567966907.0, "id": "ezgl2nc", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_d0zntp", "parent_id": "t1_ezg0qlr", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/d0zntp/joker_wins_golden_lion_at_venice_film_festival/ezgl2nc/", "score": 39, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "landontalarico", "author_id": "4ffluq58", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "It's almost like the creative people in Hollywood aren't the problem with Hollywood movies.", "created_utc": 1567897155.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "ezgifwp", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_d0zntp", "parent_id": "t1_ezg0qlr", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/d0zntp/joker_wins_golden_lion_at_venice_film_festival/ezgifwp/", "score": 8, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "ClassicResult", "author_id": "46dhuiks", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "The Daily Beast had the perfect headline: \u201cChild Rapist Roman Polanski wins Venice Film Festival Award\u201d. \n\nThe first paragraph makes two references to it as well.
