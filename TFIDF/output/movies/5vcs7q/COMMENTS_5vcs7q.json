So, the idea of a Star Wars spin off is great but because there's so much content available many would think a Han spin off is a waste, especially with Harrison Ford being the definitive portrayal of the character. \n\nFor me, I look forward to it but I do wish we got another topic to explore, especially with the directors in charge. However I think it'll be great fun and  worthy addition to the Canon, and despite the backlash for going with a Han origin and recasting him, I can get behind a reliance on the original stuff for now.
