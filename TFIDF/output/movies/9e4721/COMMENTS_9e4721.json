And even then it's not really correct since Franco, though he certainly had fascist elements under his banner, was most certainly not a fascist himself at all, but rather a super-conservative *a la* France's Petain.\n\nAs a general rule, fascism and the Church have always been at odds on a fundamental ideological level, and the Church has always been outspoken against its ideology with the exception of two Concordates signed respectively with the Germans and Italians to end the persecution of German/Italian Catholics.

A few brave priests put their lives at risk by criticizing nationalist atrocities, but **the majority of the clergy in nationalist areas revelled in their new-found power** and the increased size of their congregations. Anyone who did not attend Mass faithfully was likely to be suspected of 'red' tendencies. Entrepreneurs made a great money selling religious symbols... It was reminiscent of the way the Inquisition's persecutions of Jews and Moors helped make pork such an important part of the Spanish diet.\"\n\n---\n\nAlways remember, there are people who want this to happen again. Who stand to benefit, if reverting to brutality can be called that. They will use anything on their power to get their way. Remember, every few family homes you pass in the street houses a child who is being raped. Every second person you pass in the street would let something like this go ahead - history has proven this time and time again. That person at work who is always \"joking\" about distasteful things: they, without a shadow of a doubt, are a murderer and a rapist waiting for their excuse. **All it takes is for good people to do nothing, or to put their trust in authority and God and hope for the best. *Never again*.**", "created_utc": 1536424666.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e5m8wh6", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_9e4721", "parent_id": "t3_9e4721", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/9e4721/according_to_director_guillermo_del_toro_the_pale/e5m8wh6/", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "DurianExecutioner", "author_id": "2iacqkn", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "The sad part is that in real life the pale man captured the child.

This parallels the Pale Man who wakes to Ofelia's presence after her theft of food.\n* Ofelia acts with disobedience when she opens the \\*wrong\\* locker (the correct locker which she opens is different from the one shows in the instructions in the book). This plays into the theme about the importance of disobedience and raises the question of whether her theft of the grape was really wrong.\n* The connections between the church and the fascist regime (the false father) are also in The Captain's insistence that Ofelia refer to him as her father, and in the regime's distribution of bread to the community.\n* The rose on Ofelia's shirt (in the post-death sequence) is a reference to the Empyrean rose (symbolizing heaven) in Dante's Inferno.\n* There are many, many vaginal and menstrual symbols in the film, associated with the maternal symbol of the moon. The initial defeat of the toad is an expression of mastery over Ofelia's sexuality which destroys the clothing that symbolizes sexual repression at the hands of the state.\n\nThere is a great review of the film [right here](http://filmreadings.com/2015/12/20/pans-labyrinth/) that goes into detail on this stuff and much more.

Crucially, Pan's Labyrinth is set in 1944 and Devil's Backbone is set in 1939. You once said, \"For better or worse, it is a period that belonged only to Spain.\" What did you mean by that?\n\n> **del Toro**: Well, it was a moment when Spain was alone, completely alone in 1939. Because everybody else was trying not to upset the balance in Europe, tiptoeing around Hitler. So the republicans were alone. Mexico offered help and offered to receive emigrants from Spain and sent weapons and ships and things. After tiptoeing so much around Hitler, the civil war ended in 1939 and six months later Hitler invaded Poland. 1944 was important because once again the resistance in Spain was fighting on the side of the allies to ensure that the outcome of the second world war would not be in Hitler's favour. They sabotaged the tungsten mines in Galicia in the north of Spain, the main source of material for the building of panzer tanks in Germany. So they were sabotaging these and fighting in France in hopes that after Normandy the allies would turn their gaze upon them and take down Franco. That never happened.\n\nSo, though the fascist forces in the film are Franquistas, the context is them stopping the resistance forces from assisting the Allies and hindering Hitler's war effort. \n\nThe full interview is linked in the article but you can find it here: https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/nov/21/guardianinterviewsatbfisouthbank \n\nThe article wasn't clear enough in what it was describing.

Invariably there will be an older and respected senior, a bright young man who works for the senior, his beautiful girlfriend, and a kid sidekick. The kid sidekick will advance the plot by ignoring all common sense and endangering himself. The Senior and the Bright Young Man will tell you why it's impossible to beat godzilla, and the beautiful girlfriend will shriek about how Godzilla is now tearing up Shibuya or whatever. \n\nBut there's no tension, the characters are almost never in any real danger, no scenes where they're fleeing a building as Godzilla and the other Monster are crashing through the neighboring city block and knocking over towers. The human element is a failure in traditional kaiju because they're the characters you're supposed to identify with, and nothing interesting happens to them. They have a lot of dialogue about how the army is useless and then 10 minutes before the end of the movie they deus-ex-machina a way to drive the monsters away. \n\nYou want to see a good example of a Kaiju film? Rampage. With The Rock. There aren't a whole lot of fight scenes in it. I don't think two of the monsters ever actually fight each other until the last 20 minutes of the film. Before that it's just humans trying to find and contain the monster threat. But the human characters have reasons to be there, they face danger, they do things and things happen to them.

Like getting ash in her eyes and looking like a panda. \n\nSo I think that the director should get credit for realizing the potential for a non white Hermione, but Rowling herself seems to be trying to claim credit.

I believe the author too quickly brushes over one of their defenses of subtlety which is the actual pleasure of seeing through it, *finding* meaning in art can be immensely pleasurable. I think they diminish their argument a bit to dismiss this aspect of art appreciation, after all I think that feeling could be entirely why some people enjoy art, for them subtlety is probably not only good but necessary. To this type of person a puzzle might be more useless if it's already solved than if it's unsolved and unsolvable, so they'd never take issue with a puzzle being too difficult.\n\nI'll say that a lot of art I enjoy, I would describe as heavy-handed. I really appreciate lots of science fiction, fantasy, romance, and horror films/books/games/images that wear their hearts on their sleeves and shows you what they're thinking. I enjoy deeply subtle art as well don't get me wrong here, I just don't see being heavy handed as necessarily bad by any means.\n\nNow though, to your floating of the definition of the word, then it get's interesting. If when we say \"heavy-handed\" we mean that it has been *too* oppressively overbearing, obvious, and unsubtle, then that's an opinion that can be true for you and for me to say something that I think heavy-handed is good no longer makes much sense. If when we say \"heavy-handed\" we mean that it *is* oppressively overbearing, obvious, and unsubtle then both of our statements can be true, you can dislike that aspect of it and I can like that aspect of it. I'm clearly not using the definition that it's taking it *too* far, but rather the definition that it has taken it far. I feel it's important to clarify that, since it could change how we see this issue entirely.\n\n", "created_utc": 1536427893.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1536428156.0, "id": "e5mby5k", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_9e4721", "parent_id": "t1_e5macnf", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/9e4721/according_to_director_guillermo_del_toro_the_pale/e5mby5k/", "score": 14, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "10GuyIsDrunk", "author_id": "8439u", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I just want to say that after each of both you and the other editors responses you both give great examples and reasons to agree with either perspective.
