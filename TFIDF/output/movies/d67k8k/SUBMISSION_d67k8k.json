To clarify, not like watching a bunch of Tom Cruise movies. What I mean is I\u2019ll watch a movie like Mission Impossible that also has Simon Pegg, then my next movie will feature Simon Pegg like Paul, then I\u2019ll watch a movie like Bridesmaids because of Kristen Wiig, and so on and so on. \n\nIt makes things a little more exciting and end up getting a good mix up of movies.  It\u2019s even fun when you end up picking actors with smaller roles and go from there.  It\u2019s my  \u201c6 degrees of separation\u201d technique for picking movies to watch. \n\nDoes anyone else do something like that when choosing movies?\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nEDIT: Thanks so much for the good conversation! I\u2019m glad I can help you possibly enjoy your movie experience more. \n\nAlso to clear some things up for the people saying \u201cI\u2019m wasting my life\u201d. \n1, movies are a passion of mine, so it\u2019s time well spent to me. Movies are my escape. \n2.  I work from home, so I generally watch a movie or two while I do paperwork and send emails at night. \n\nAnd thank you for the platinum, gold and silver.
