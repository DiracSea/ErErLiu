Like how you can still see the show buried in there somewhere but a lot of the jokes don't land, the delivery is stiff, characters haven't been fully developed, and overall it doesn't \"feel\" like *Futurama* yet? That's the first half of the season. It definitely has its moments but it takes a bit to find its voice and get into a groove, and after that it really picks up. If you're expecting *Jurassic Bark* or *Godfellas* you're going to be massively disappointed, it definitely feels like it could reach that level some day but it's not there yet.\n\nAlso don't expect a true Futurama-style show. It seems to be going more for the *Bojack Horseman* style of cartoon, with much slower pacing, serialized narrative storytelling, and a lot of darker/reflective themes. It's definitely more zany and less depressing than *Bojack* but the tonal shift from *Futurama* and *The Simpsons* can be a bit jarring if you're not expecting it.\n\nBut man, I'm a huge fan and can't wait to see where it goes in the future. Once you get used to the different style, and once the characters start to develop it really does become something special. A lot of the naysayers seem to be disappointed that it's not at the level of *Futurama* season 4 yet, but that's just absurd, and after the initial stumbles it starts to progress pretty quickly.

As anyone in a similar role will tell you, one of our primary goals is to get prospective students into our admissions pipeline.

The completion rate for any given form will go down for every field you add. *But*, our admissions department demands that I collect quite a bit of information from new prospects. (This is a constant battle.) So looooong ago (2005-ish) I stumbled upon a sneaky solution (which you've probably encountered because it's more common now): Start the user with a mini form, which when submitted goes to a longer form pre-filled with the info they've already entered and a message like \"You're almost done! We just need a little more information.\"\n\nI'm sure the users groan and get a bit annoyed, but then they finish the form anyway because they've already invested a little time into doing so.
