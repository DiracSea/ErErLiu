So from an audience perspective this has been a clear win. And with the coming Disney+ steaming service this setup is such a massive value prop for the consumer that is hard to argue. \n\nOn the other hand with all this power and influence that one small abuse of power from Disney\u2019s part will multiply massively when put into practice. I can\u2019t speak of what values the next Disney CEO will have but Bob Iger has always struck me as a guy actually steering this behemoth of a company with integrity during his run as CEO. Always focusing on quality and story telling on the highest level. In many was he has done a massively great job at this. This doesn\u2019t mean that it has been perfect but damn if anybody can achieve this again. \n\nSo it\u2019s a mixed bag in my eyes. It all comes down to trust.

The original U.S. copyright law was for 14 years plus a 14 year renewal. If you haven't turned your profit in that amount of time, you probably never will. The initial purpose of copyright law was to encourage creative endeavors by making them profitable for content-makers, but not make them too long that they stop creating because the money keeps rolling in. And it was also supposed to be short enough so those works could be built upon by others if the original author isn't using the ptoperty anymore. \n\nAs a corporation, Disney obviously kept creating new content, but there are quite a lot of instances of creators having early success and then just sitting on those profits and properties and never doing anything again. And then with the insanely long copyright we have now, a lot of properties are just being profited off of by the creator's heirs. Copyright as initially conceived was never intended to be a trust fund for future generations of non-creators.\n\nBut yeah, 20-30 years seems about right. However, I think that even in that window, since consumption has changed, there might need to be changes. Like, as long as there has been radio, broadcasters have been able to use songs as long as they pay a predetermined royalty to the rights-holders, and this has carried over to streaming services. This kind of thing should probably apply to video now, too, at least, after maybe a 10-20 year initial period. I think it would encourage the creation of more new content and be beneficial to artists if YouTube, Netflix, and Disney+, and Johnny's Awesome Website all had the right to upload every movie and TV show older than 20 years as long as they paid out a predetermined royalty rate to the original creator, based on number of views. That way, the services are largely competing on the basis of *new* content, forcing them to create more and hire more talent. The more artists' work goes into production, the more artists can make a living off that work. At the same time, after 20 years, it would allow  artists to still get paid for a while longer while giving broader access to the public so that those artists *do* get paid. As it is, the big companies don't even bother with older content if it's not going to be profitable, and instead license big name content for big prices. The big guys keep getting bigger while the small guys get nothing.\n\nSo maybe there should be a copyright scheme for music, movies, and written works where the creator has exclusive rights for about 20 years, at which point it becomes a \"fair use\" use property or something where anybody can offer it so long as they pay royalties back to the creator. And then after 50, it's completely royalty-free public domain. The artist gets paid while they're alive but is also encouraged to keep creating new work. And of course, they could always trademark individual properties like a Mickey Mouse or Harry Potter or logo or whatever, so that Hulu isn't ripping off your still in-production character down the line just because the first book/movie/whatever has entered the public domain.", "created_utc": 1573052841.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1573053220.0, "id": "f6pbzsq", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_dsb7di", "parent_id": "t1_f6ooktq", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/dsb7di/its_time_to_break_up_disney_says_author_of_new/f6pbzsq/", "score": 38, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "persimmonmango", "author_id": "15zn803p", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "This 100%.
