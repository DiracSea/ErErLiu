Sounds don't come from MIDI, they come from the samples. MIDI (Music Instrument Digital Interface) is simply a protocol (like TCP or IP) on which virtually all instrument interfaces communicate in the music world. The controller (keyboard for example) says [play this note] and creates a MIDI event which makes the computer say [ok, playing the sound connected to this MIDI event]. Sometimes this involves velocity (how hard it's played, which triggers different samples in the most complex instruments).\nAnyway...The sample is what you hear triggered by the MIDI event. \n\nThe disingenuous part they're referring to comes from the fact that although it is true that both a piano and a 2 minute excerpt from *Thriller* are both samples and can be triggered within a larger context, it is not necessarily an exercise in skill or creativity to play a song \"live\" using solely the latter sample whereas the former takes a great deal of both.\n\nYou wouldn't call someone who presses play on a CD player \"skillful\". The skill comes from the rhythmic timing involved and the selection of samples. However, even the most talented of these people are still not technically creating anything if they do not first create the music they stitch together.
