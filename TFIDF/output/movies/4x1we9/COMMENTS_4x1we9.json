Said this in another thread, but my group of friends went to see this opening night. We are all 28-33 year old women, and we grew up with the Franchise. So to have our fav franchise come back, and have female characters lead it -- we were super excited.\n\nBut the film itself was horrendous. The writing was bad. The FX looked cheap as hell (IMO even worse then the original). The jokes were cringe and constantly fell flat. And the biggest sin: the characters had NO CHEMISTRY together (which is what made Ghostbusters great to begin with), and the characters were actually unlikable.\n\nThe other thing that really turned us off, was how much the movie tried pandering to us because of our gender. It was completely off putting. The film spends so much time shitting all over men, while winking at the audience and saying \"hey, this is empowering for women, feel empowered now!\".\n\nThe film is actually incredibly sexist too! The irony is that the studio was so focused on \"sexist males hating the movie\", and then the film itself ended up being sexist. Let's see:\n\n* Literally, every man in the film is portrayed as incompetent, stupid, or a major asshole.\n\n* The Ghostbusters hire a Male secretary purely for his good looks and body, and they sexually ogle and objectify him. He's also dumb as rocks (in comparison, the original Ghostbusters sectary was smart and sassy, and didn't put up with anyone's shit). \n\n* They defeat the final ghost by shooting it in the male Genitalia. The joke is, women are defeating a man by going after his genitals.\n\n* The main villain is poorly written, and a stereotypical angry \"gamer\" cliche, that hates all women.\n\n**I've never seen a film so antagonistic towards a large portion of its audience before.** It made my group completely uncomfortable, especially since the film kept being like: come on ladies, this is EMPOWERING!\n\nBut it's not. Literally, everything I just posted above in bullet points -- flip the gender, and tell me if YOU would be okay with it. We weren't okay with it. I  believe most women would NOT be okay with it. So why is it then okay for them to turn around and do all those things to men?\n\nSomething insane too, I actually saw a female critic say: \"Women will be amazed, at how well the film nails what it's like to talk to a sexy man, that is really dumb\". She actually thought this was a GOOD POINT of the film, and thought it was progressive. Imagine if the genders were reversed and it was an all Male Ghostbusters group, that hired a sectary purely for her body, and so they could sexually objectify her on the job. Oh and she is dumb as rocks. Imagine if a male critic had said: \"Men will be surprised, at how much the movie nails what it's like for Men to meet a sexy woman that is dumb as rocks\". People would have been outraged, and foaming at the mouth. \n\n\n**Ignoring all the exploitation, sexism, and gender pandering -- the film was really fuckin bad. Like the writing itself was so terrible. We honestly walked away from the film completely dismayed, at just how bad the thing was.**\n\nAnd the weird thing is, critics overall gave it a 75% at launch. I did a scan of a lot of reviews, and saw a lot of \"suck it misogynistic men\". \"This film sticks it to all the sexist men\". \"Sexist males, you thought this film was going to be bad? Think again!\" It's just like, what the fuck does that have to do with the movie you are reviewing. Either it's good or bad. \n\nI honestly feel like there was some critics out there, that felt it was their duty to give this a passing grade, just to stick to it all the sexist men out there. But after seeing this video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWROBiX1eSc\n\nIt's pretty obvious that the # of sexist comments were a small %, and Sony Pictures totally exploited the situation (not the first time they have done this. They are totally scummy company). \n\nSo I'm glad this film flopped. Film was straight up trash. And it amazes me that so many critics said Suicide Squad was unwatchable and 10x worse. That it was the worst film they have seen in years. The film IS bad overall. But my group of friends walked away from Suicide Squad at least enjoying the cast of characters. We at least enjoyed half of the film. It's just so bizarre to see critics come together to say Suicide Squad is the worst film in years, but then say Ghosbusters is a 75%. I definitely think Suicide Squad should be critically hammered, because it's glaring issues. But it's just like the twilight zone to me and my group of friends, after we saw both. Ghostbusters was fuckin awful front to back. And yet...75%? WTF\n\n**TLDR;** Me and my group of friends thought Ghostbusters was trash. Completely exploitative, gender pandering, sexist, and incredibly unfunny and poorly written. Sony Pictures is a scumbag corporation that exploited  the sexist comments and tried to make this film be something it's not. They tried to sell this as feminism/ female empowerment, when in reality -- it was just a really shitty comedy. Totally glad it flopped. \n\n**EDIT:**\n\nI did not expect this post to get this many replies, I'm honestly surprised. I made my reply like 3 hours after the thread went up, and usually late replies just get buried. So I apologize if I'm not replying to every post. I made the post and just walked away, not expecting it to get upvoted. \n\n**There are some people that strongly disagree with me. That argue that the film never had pandering in it**. I don't know what to tell you, except to say - **me and my friends all went in to see this movie excited, and walked out feeling like the film was talking down to us, and pandering to our gender**. If you don't agree with that, and you didn't see it that way -- all power to you. I totally respect your opinion. I'm not saying me and my group of friends opinion is objectively right. So if you don't agree, I apologize. \n\nBut the way I see it is this:\n\n* Why else would you have a punch line of a joke be -- the ghost busters beating the last ghost villain, by shooting it in the male genitals? **The punch line to the joke is LITERALLY -- women shot a man in his genitals, to take him down.** The joke was completely cringe, and IMO served no other purpose then pandering to the whole female empowerment angle that Sony did with the marketing. What else would you call that? **Would the joke have been okay, if an all Male cast shot a female ghost in her vagina or breast's to take  her down?**\n\n* What else do you call it - when the original Ghostbusters hired a female sectary, that was smart/sassy and DIDNT take any shit from the group -- and **yet, the remake has the all female Ghostbuster hire a Male sectary, purely so they can sexually objectify him and ogle him?** **And the punch line is that, he's dumb as rocks. And his only asssett is his body**. Please, tell me **why the remake needed to  have this in there, when it's completely sexist. And the original h ad nothing like that?**.  What other purpose does that serve? At least to my group, we felt again...it was pandering to my gender. \n\n* What else would it be - to have EVERY Male in the film, be incompetent, stupid, or a major asshole? The fact that they set it up, so **every Man in the movie happens to be these three things. While the Women in contrast, are all capable and not defined by these three traits.** **What purpose does this serve? Other then to be pandering to my gender?**\n\nLook, I get if you don't agree that the film didn't straight up turn to the audience and say \"this is female empowerment\"...but the film IMO was pandering to my gender. And my group of friends all agreed. We all saw the same thing. The film talks down to its audience, and completely panders. That's how we felt. If you didn't feel that way, I don't know what to say. I mean, I'll respect your opinion.\n\n\n**This doesn't even have to be about gender. The film was just poorly written. But what rubbed me and my friends the wrong way, is how Sony marketing tried to exploit female empowerment while marketing the film. It rubbed us the wrong way, how the film constantly did things that WE WOULD NOT BE COMFORTABLE WITH, if it was MEN DOING THE SAME THING TO OUR GENDER. Literally, take all the bullet points I made in my post, and flip the genders. And tell me if most women would be okay with it?**\n\nAnd for that matter, let's be honest. Would critics and social activist be okay with this? Or would they flip their shit? IMO the answer is obviously the latter. **And so, if it's not okay for Men to do this to my gender, then why is it okay for Women to do it to Men? And this is exactly why the film rubbed us the wrong way, and made us feel uncomfortable**. \n\n\n", "created_utc": 1470845709.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1470862339.0, "id": "d6byisc", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_4x1we9", "parent_id": "t3_4x1we9", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/4x1we9/ghostbusters_heading_for_70mplus_loss_sequel/d6byisc/", "score": 3983, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "We did it patriarchy", "created_utc": 1470839493.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d6bttjv", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_4x1we9", "parent_id": "t3_4x1we9", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/4x1we9/ghostbusters_heading_for_70mplus_loss_sequel/d6bttjv/", "score": 5687, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Lonelan", "author_id": "574zj", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Ghostbusters 73% approval rating on rotten tomatoes.\n\nSuicide Squad 26% approval rating on rotten tomatoes.\n\nWut?", "created_utc": 1470842593.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d6bw2x4", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_4x1we9", "parent_id": "t3_4x1we9", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/4x1we9/ghostbusters_heading_for_70mplus_loss_sequel/d6bw2x4/", "score": 364, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Sir_Jimmy_Russles", "author_id": "xvlpc", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Amy Pascal is an idiot.", "created_utc": 1470849510.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d6c1lke", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_4x1we9", "parent_id": "t3_4x1we9", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/4x1we9/ghostbusters_heading_for_70mplus_loss_sequel/d6c1lke/", "score": 26, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "shane_c", "author_id": "3za1d", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Good, stop making piece of shit reboots and then calling people sexist when they call you out for making a piece of shit reboot.

Have Wiig, McCarthy, and McKinnon all working at the university together studying the paranormal but still keep Wiig a physicist that wants to be taken seriously, while McCarthy is the Ray like true believer, and McKinnon the science/tech Egon type character. Now for Dance; he would still be the Dean of the university but also make him the secret head of the Cult of Gozer. When he finds out that the main characters are making strides that could interfere with the Cult bringing about the end of the world he has their research shut down, equipment destroyed/confiscated, fires them, and kicks them off campus. That gives the villain more motivation than \"people are mean to me\". It also gives the opportunity to show the Ghostbusters setting up shop, developing new tech, etc.\n\nShit, the Cult of Gozer alone can make a great antagonist and could also serve as a social commentary if you really want it to. In Ghostbusters canon many of the high priests of the cult were the rich and powerful members of society. You could make the movie about the little guy fighting against all odds against the the 1%.

He's the one who sees the irony in the Staypuft situation: he's a sailor in NYC: just get him laid, no problem. That's more perception than off-the-wall wacky. Stantz was a childlike engineer, and what made him sort of overly normal was that he was naively honest and forthright (he sabatoges the negotiation for the firehouse by getting excited by the firepoles). Egon was a science nerd who knew the value of collecting materials (spores, slime) for study. Winston was maybe a bit of luck, since the orginal casting intended was Eddie Murphy, and maybe the original idea was for him to be the one wacky character; instead, Ernie Hudson made him appear more normal and grounded in reality than the others. Together, they were all funny characters with interesting traits, but they weren't bizarre and zany.

When she does things like warble \"come out, come out, wherever you are\" I just want to roll up in a ball under my chair from the cringe.

Look at The Thing and the prequel (also, oddly enough, called The Thing). The 80s version was already a reboot, but it was superior to the original. It starred all men. \n\nThe later prequel starred a multi-gendered cast with a female lead. It's pretty good, too.\n\nIt wasn't reviled because it didn't crap all over the 80s version. It just expanded the story. All the characters we loved from the Kurt Russell movie still existed, but now there were new characters, and new angles to the story. They even had the decency and courtesy to tie the two movies together and have the ending of the prequel exactly match up with the beginning of its predecessor. \n\nThey came to The Thing and didn't wreck it. You could take or leave the prequel, but you didn't have to accept that they'd completely erased the 80s movie, as they did with Ghostbusters.\n\nAnd therein lies the true crime of Ghostbusters: They deleted the 80s continuity. It's gone. Any new movies or video games will likely take place in the new continuity. Yes, the original still exists, but Sony's not going to put money into it now. The new Ghostbusters canon overwrote the old canon, and then they killed the franchise by making a horrible movie. \n\nLook at Star Wars. Yes, they killed the EU, but only to clean it up and keep going with the main canon, and they're gradually introducing elements from the EU into official canon as they continue with the story... And that's the important point: They CONTINUED the story. They didn't end the old Star Wars and get rid of everything in favor of newer, worse ideas. They kept the continuity going, and introduced a great female lead in both new movies AND in the animated Rebels series, and so far Star Wars has been pretty awesome. \n\nIt was never about the gender of the cast. It was ALWAYS about the decision to freeze out Ivan Reitman, delete the old continuity, and strong-arm the original cast to play nonsensical cameo roles NOT as the original Ghostbusters (because in the new continuity they were never Ghostbusters) but as random, almost useless extras in this new story. \n\nSony didn't just make a bad Ghostbusters movie; They killed the old franchise AND the new one simultaneously.
