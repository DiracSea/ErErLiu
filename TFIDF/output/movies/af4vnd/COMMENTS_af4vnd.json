My grandfather is still himself, Kirby. He has been remarkably well up until now, he lives alone and takes care of himself 100%. Four years ago he beat cancer and we all thought that was going to be it for him, but he surprised us all, kicked it\u2019s ass, and has been healthy since. He still cooks for himself, goes fishing a couple times a week, takes care of his cats, gets his paper every morning from the street and reads it, and even conducts some business of his own when he wants to! He is simply remarkable. World War II vet. Lied about his age so he could serve early. Only ever worked for anyone other than himself while he was in college after the war, first at a book store making $.35/hour and then at a gas station making $.65 an hour. After that he started a company and never looked back, was never a payroll employee again. \n\nUnfortunately he has congestive heart failure and last week his blood oxygen levels reached such low figures he started to hallucinate and had to be hospitalized. Only the second time in my life he has been in the hospital. While we were lucky and he was released  after two days, the result is he has to be on an oxygen tank daily, and is supposed to sleep with a CPAP. Also he can\u2019t eat anything with salt in it anymore, which frustrates him because he doesn\u2019t know how to cook without salt, and cooking has been one of his great joys in life, especially in the last few years when he has been limited in what he can do. \n\nMy wish for him for the past few years has always been that he lives as long as he can do so while retaining his dignity. He is a proud, strong, accomplished old grump and I can\u2019t imagine him being in a place physically where he can\u2019t take care of himself. I know he doesn\u2019t want that. This week has been better but I am scared he\u2019s reaching the point where he will begin to really lose that dignity that makes him such an amazing person, and it makes me horribly sad. He is a treasure to me and my family, and I don\u2019t want to see him go down that road where he loses himself. I can only pray that he either turns things around and gets back to being able to go fishing off his dock at his farm, and being his proud old self, or that things get worse quickly and he passes peacefully and with his dignity intact. \n\nI am so sorry to hear about your grandfather. It makes me immeasurably sad to imagine seeing my paw paw that way. I sincerely hope that things get better for him in whatever way is best for him at this time. If you ever want to talk about it please feel free to PM me. I treasure my grandparents and lost my other grandfather a few years ago and I know that pain only too well. I know it\u2019s hard now but try to remember him as he was, if you have those memories and I hope you do, that is where the treasure lies.

He was as generous and kind a man as you'd ever meet. Unfortunately, that has all faded. He's had Alzheimer's symptoms for the last 15 years and he turned into a bitter, mean-spirited old man before he moved to the nursing home. Now he just sits in his wheelchair with his eyes squeezed shut, his eyelashes crusted over. Sometimes, when I stroke his hair as I feed him his mashed food, he'll open his eyes and I think that he knows someone is in front of him. But then his blue eyes turn grey before he shuts them and I have to start the whole process over again to feed him his next spoonful. It has been a slow process of grief and although he's been a shell of himself, I know it'll hurt when he eventually passes. His has been a slow death and I can barely remember the man he was before. He's my last living grandparent, but what he's doing isn't really living.\n\nJuxtapose that with my grandmother's death this summer. Hers was short and sweet. Surrounded by her family and in a home that kept her social and comfortable, she simply closed her eyes in her sleep and never woke up. She'd had a hard life, but at least her passing came easy.\n\nMy aunt's death this summer was anything but. She waged a hard battle against cancer. She survived countless chemo and radiation treatments, tumor removal surgeries and lung and heart treatments over her last years on earth. Her death was neither quick nor easy, but she can at least rest in peace now.\n\nMy memories of these people have predominately been about how they died. I tried my best to be there physically and in spirit in the end, picking them up off the floor when the nausea made them keel over, washing their soiled laundry, even just visiting with them on a daily basis to let them know that someone cares. But they're dead now and all I can see is their caskets in front of me. I have come to terms with all this stuff, for better or for worse, but on grey days like this, all I can see is the color of my aunt's skin in the sky.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou know, across the street from the hospital where my aunt and my (other) grandmother died, there is a bit of graffiti. It translates to \"who dignifies garegiving?\" I find it so refreshing. One th one hand, the people in the hospital or nursing homes do. They treat patients and residents with respect, but the way you put it, your paw paw maintains his own dignity. But you can, too. When I spill some food on grandpa's chin, I wipe it off immediately. Some of the other residents don't get that when they're fed and their faces are just covered in debris. You can help maintain his dignity in whatever way you can. Obviously it gets harder and harder if they get demented, but I would also hug and kiss my aunt. No matter when I saw her. And she wasn't the huggy kissy type either. I don't think I ever saw her hold her husband's hand.  \nAnd believe me, being in a home can still be dignified. I drive a neighbor to the nursing home to visit his wife. He is way past independent and can barely maintain a conversation. That man has way less dignity in his life than his Alzheimer's ridden wife. Better to be in a home with some semblance of normalcy than struggling to keep the chaos of old age at bay with no 24/7 help.", "created_utc": 1547309904.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "edwevdr", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_af4vnd", "parent_id": "t1_edw2cro", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/af4vnd/filmmaker_jo_andres_and_wife_of_steve_buscemi_has/edwevdr/", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "RaefLaFriends", "author_id": "2cnkxw89", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "From my point of view the Jedi are evil ", "created_utc": 1547304071.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "edw7ntv", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_af4vnd", "parent_id": "t1_edw7jcx", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/af4vnd/filmmaker_jo_andres_and_wife_of_steve_buscemi_has/edw7ntv/", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Username_678", "author_id": "x68im", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Cheers man, just stay over in Sydney and we won't have a problem!", "created_utc": 1547292443.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "edvx7tb", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_af4vnd", "parent_id": "t1_edvwwul", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/af4vnd/filmmaker_jo_andres_and_wife_of_steve_buscemi_has/edvx7tb/", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "NewZealandTemp", "author_id": "126a19", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I am BRCA+ like Angelina and I have had all the surgeries and was thrown into menopause at 36.
