The 7:00 show was in 3D with \"UltraAVX\" which cost an extra $5.00 to make the ticket $17.00 total.   At 7:00pm they started by showing 11 consecutive commercials taking 7 minutes, mostly car ads.  Then they showed  4 movie trailers which took 8 minutes.  Then they played an ad encouraging me to download their app so I get \"loyalty points\".    The movie started at 7:17.\n\nI have an idea, instead of trying to gamify my loyalty with crappy mobile apps and worthless points, focus on giving me a good experience.   Car ads?
