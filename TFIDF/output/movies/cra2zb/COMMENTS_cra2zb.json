It has a purpose.\n\nImmediately before the scene, the Terminator was chasing Sarah and Kyle and hit a wall with his car. The cops show up, and the Terminator is gone, so they take Sarah and Kyle to the police station. Considering the Terminator is later going to kill everyone at the station, you might wonder why it ran away then instead of facing the cops that arrested Kyle and took Sarah to the station. Well, this scene shows that it sustained damage and needed to repair itself. In a visual way, without using any words.\n\nThe other thing it does is prepare the audience for the finale where the metal skeleton chases Sarah without the skin. You got a little bit of a preview of what the Terminator looks like underneath the living parts, so you're not taken completely by surprise.  That scene feels correct, like what you've been told to expect it looks like. Cameron does this throughout the movie: when Sarah gives up her location at the motel, you're not completely taken by surprise that the Terminator could fake her mother's voice because it had previously faked a cop's voice early on in the movie.

Functional stick figures that show what you need to conceptualize and set up shots, but not much more. It doesn't always correlate to how they approach visual design on the film, but I think that those who have more polished boards are often much more visual thinkers in general. Rough boards are less clear. They could be less visually-inclined or may not be as good at picturing it in advance. Maybe they prefer a looser, more improvisation style. Maybe it's less important to their style, like when Kevin Smith referred to his blocking on *Chasing Amy* as \"just stand there and say my dialogue!\" There are a number of possibilities.\n\nThey don't always say something specific, but they show a unique element of a director's working process.", "created_utc": 1566031209.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1566084860.0, "id": "ex5su68", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_cra2zb", "parent_id": "t1_ex365gp", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/cra2zb/an_original_storyboard_from_the_terminator_by_jim/ex5su68/", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Belgand", "author_id": "a7cha", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Right!.

Both Arnold and Jim had lunch together discussing the part and after going their separate ways, Jim changed his mind and thought /u/GovSchwarzenegger would be perfect for the bad guy role.\n\nThere's a whole bunch of concept both painted and drawn art for the film by James Cameron that includes a concept of what the terminator would look like holding a pistol and missing half its face.  I believe Cameron redid the painting after Arnold was cast to show everyone what he would look like in the part and later sent it to him.
