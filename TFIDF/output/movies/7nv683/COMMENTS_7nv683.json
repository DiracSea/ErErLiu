The cops have a legit relationship as partners, and are upfront with each other - there's no artificial suspense of 'did he let the orc go?' or sudden reveal of the orc, because he straight up tells his partner when his partner asks. Instead of elf assassins and some chick stuck to a wall, there's a legit, scary-ass witch and a cult trying to bring her back. Ward is not a Bright. There is no IA investigation, he just wants to provide for his daughter and have a career. The dirty cops involve a hit squad, and the FBI guys actually do detective work and help forward the plot. There's no random strip club shootouts or over the top homie-speak. There's no 'chosen one' - the idea of a prophecy is a metaphor. This is a straight cop drama/conspiracy thriller, and it's great.\n\n* Ward's name is Alvins, no mention made of his ethnicity (until later - he's white, but doesn't matter). His neighbors are latino, but the fairy thing is mostly the same.\n\n* His living situation is unclear as to whether it's a divorce situation (if they were even married), but his wife is much more hostile toward him and is struggling to find a new job. She has a date tonight and her daughter (Jakoby mentions 'she's not your kid') is staying at her grandmother's tonight.\n\n* Jakoby comes to pick up Alvins/Ward, and Alvins gets mad at him because orcs aren't supposed to be driving and he popped the tire up on the curb when he tried to pull up to the house. Jakoby says he drives fine, and Alvins remains concerned whether someone would notice (we don't know about the investigation at this point, but that's likely why).\n\n* The 'hey rockstar' scene between Jakoby and the daughter is the same, as is the car ride with the exception Alvins isn't a huge fucking asshole to his long-term partner for no reason.\n\n* Racist cops in the locker room scene is a little shorter, but has the same beats. \n\n* The briefing talks about 'it's gonna be hot today, we're stretched thin and backup is scarce, be careful.' The chief asks for Alvins and Jakoby to recount the events that culminated in the orc kid getting away, and we hear about the 10ft fire escape here. Instead of Ward getting shot while Jakoby gets a burrito, the kid has a gun and Alvins and Jakoby pursue on foot until Alvins rolls his ankle and Jakoby is eluded. \n\n* The chief dismisses Jakoby and tells Alvins that the investigation could get him fired and he'll more than likely be out of consideration for making detective, giving Alvins actual stakes and goals for his personal arc because he not only wants to support the kid (even though he says 'it's not about that'), but he wants to actually feel a sense of progress and meaning in his life. Chief tells him to think about whether Jakoby could be lying and his career may depend on that.\n\n* The ride-along bit is more interesting because the partners actually feel like partners and joke with one another. There's no harsh animosity or threatening aggressiveness - they're hanging out, doing their jobs, and enjoying each other's company while on patrol. Also, there's no forced 'Will Smith punking orcs like he just watched The Wire and thinks all cops do this' - it seems a lot more nuanced and everyday.\n\n~~I can update this with further differences/notable points as I read through the day, if anybody is interested.~~\n\n#EDIT 1: Through the invisible wall scene\n\n* The bearded dude is just on top of a roof yelling and ranting and looks emaciated rather than a hobo swordsman. Ramirez is still there, but they joke about the guy on the roof. There's no drawn-out scene in the middle of an intersection, nor any arrest - they just pull up, talk to Ramirez, joke about the Dark Lord, then leave for another dispatch call.\n\n* Oh, right - the feds come out and are looking for something, but they are only there for like 30 seconds and the scene changes. There's no 'hello Will Smith we are IA and want you to fuck your partner because this is how IA actually works.'\n\n* This goes right to the 'spotter' scene before they find the wand. Much more direct and finely edited in terms of pacing, I think. The shootout happens just as quickly as it did, and Jakoby is just as rattled - one difference is it's late afternoon instead of 'dramatic night firefight,' but that's purely stylistic.\n\n* The house seems a lot more damaged and blown out - people are blown in half and disintegrated with entire walls being torn open. Going through to find the shooter, then finding the Bright is more or less the same. There's no 'elf lady hooked up to the wall and bleeding' at all.\n\n* The wand seems a lot more traditional than the glowing stone thing we got - purely stylistic, I think. The elf girl doesn't give them the impression she's a Bright because the wand just goes off, and the lookout kid runs to tell his gang what happened.\n\n* The cops arrive and discuss what just happened in the same way, but the dialogue seems a bit tighter and less rambling than how it was delivered. They decide to take the wand and to kill the elf girl so that there's no witnesses, assuming Alvins will fall into line to further his career and have support during the investigation. Not only that, but they've arranged a hit on the elf girl and Jakoby (who is outside comforting the elf girl, as in the movie) to make it looks like an 'accident.' I feel like that's actually really important, because it presents even higher stakes than 'hey dude go kill your orc partner cause we said,' especially because we have established Alvins and Jakoby are friends.\n\n* There's a funny line during the 'will Alvins betray Jakoby' scene where one of the bad cops tells him he's living in a 'fuckin fantasy land.' Not bad, Max Landis.\n\n* The 'tell me you fucking lied' scene between Alvins and Jakoby stays pretty much the same, but then Landis removes so much unnecessary drama from the rest of the story by having Jakoby not only admit to letting the kid go, but telling Alvins that it was the wrong kid and explaining the whole situation in their argument as the corrupt cops look on from a distance. Not only that, but Jakoby explains that following the robbery, Alvins chased the wrong orc kid wearing red out of the shop and Jakoby found out but tried to cover for his partner because he knew he was on thin ice and trying to make detective. Instead of orc cop just trying to make his partner like him and be buddies, there's a real partnership with give and take and sacrifices. Wow.\n\n* There's no slow-mo Britpop shootout - it's literally bang-bang, John Wick style shooting that happens \"so quick you can't catch your breath,\" in Landis' words. Jakoby still is justifiably upset and apprehends Alvins, checks on the cops, then tries to call it in as the gang (only seven guys in the script) approaches.\n\n* The gang's leader isn't named \"Poison\" like an anime character, his name is Salinas and \"his voice is... dripping with poison.\" He's not in a wheelchair, which isn't important, but he also doesn't have \"only God can judge me\" tattooed on his face like David Ayer apparently really likes to do with his antagonists, which is important.\n\n* The gang surrounding the car looking for the wand plays out normally, as does the escape, but now we have a precedent for Jakoby being a bad driver and he swerves around in a way that makes sense before the wand floats and they hit that wall thing.\n\nMore updates coming, I don't have much to do at work today haha\n\n", "created_utc": 1515003448.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1515021165.0, "id": "ds4z426", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7nv683", "parent_id": "t1_ds4wqxx", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7nv683/bright_sequel_announced_by_netflix/ds4z426/", "score": 84, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Chris_Parker", "author_id": "6y7n8", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I'm only a quarter of the way through the script, but what stands out to me the most is that the two leads feel more like people with lives outside of the movie.

They know each other, and it seems that these are the people that were coming to clean up and set the scene for Jakoby's assassination. Pollard tells them they got away and have the wand, and once they get all the information he has, they shoot him with Alvins' gun (which was left on-scene earlier, I guess).\n\n* Gibson interviews some elderly neighbors, who identify Alvins as a white dude (obviously doesn't matter to the story, but it's a difference, so there you go) and describe what they saw happen from their window. Gibson asks if anybody else is home that may have seen, but they say their grandson is elsewhere and she shoots them both in the head and Landis explains that yeah, that's not a cop. Easy way to show who the bad guys are without having five or six moving parts making up the antagonists, I think.\n\n* Instead of all the bodies (of fucking *cops*, as well) just laying out in the street, the strike team is actually cleaning the scene and removing the bodies to avoid suspicion before moving out to hunt for our cop protagonists. Simple attention to detail, but it adds a lot to the atmosphere, I think. Also, at some point somebody says something like 'this blood smells like gasoline' - but we don't see who's. This comes back later.\n\n* The gang find the cruiser wrecked after hitting the invisible wall and fire on it, only to find it empty. They talk among themselves and reiterate to the audience that the cops are stretched thin, otherwise they would have beaten the gang to this wrecked cruiser, and call in reinforcements.\n\n* Tikka and the cops are still hiding just out of sight and watching that go down, but Alvins is still handcuffed at this point (I think that's different from the film, but at this point in watching the movie I was already mostly checked out, so...).\n\n* Jakoby has the wand tucked into his belt, and it seems like there's no 'if you touch this, you will die' bullshit going on. Not that that was a good or bad thing in the movie, necessarily, but Landis is clearly treating the wand as a magical gun that can 'just go off' instead of a WMD or the Power Stone from Guardians of the Galaxy. Personally, I like that a little more because it's closer to traditional fantasy, but totally subjective.\n\n* They establish more clearly the concept of a binding spell being the reason the car 'hit a wall' at this point, and Jakoby leads them away from the crash scene and the gang while still being wary of Alvins, who keeps trying to help by suggesting what to do. It's clear that Alvins is the vet and is better in combat, compared to Jakoby being a friendlier, puppy-dog type. I like that dynamic a lot, and it did show up a bit in the film.\n\n* Instead of randomly appearing in a different building, Jakoby is leading them down a street because he's not great with tactics and the gang sees them, giving chase. There's also no strip club or whatever at this point - instead, they take refuge in somebody's garage that they break into to get away from the gang.\n\n* Alvins is finally uncuffed at this point and given a gun (I think Jakoby's service weapon, cause he has the shotgun from the cruiser as well), and this is where the 'the lock is outside on the ground' scene happens. Alvins is also way more jacked up from the crash - he's bloodied and woozy.\n\n* The gang leaves and Jakoby asks Alvins for the gun back, who obliges him. They clean Alvins up as he explains what happened. They actually address the elephant in the room, that Alvins came out ready to swing at Jakoby before he killed the crooked cops, and they talk about if Alvins actually thought Jakoby would put orc blood over the law, and they don't spend too much time dwelling on it because there's sort of the whole 'we just shot cops and there's a wand everyone is after' thing going on.\n\n* They decide they can't call the station, and they can't go too far because of the binding spell, and they can't ditch the wand because that's a huge weapon that can do bad shit in the wrong hands. Tikka mentions 'the witch' will be looking for her wand because 'they hurt her, but not enough' as the gang starts to gather outside the garage with weapons drawn. They retreat into the house to find a single mother and her baby, and they try to quiet the baby and get them both out of harm's way as the gang is still forming outside.\n\n* The baby starts crying and won't quiet down, and Alvins pushes the mom and baby to the floor as the gang opens fire on the house. Jakoby breaks through the back door as a gang member rounds the corner, shoots at him, misses, and Jakoby blasts him. It throws him off though, and you can tell he's never really seen combat that close before - again, showing his personality and character a lot better. He snaps out of it and runs with the others.\n\n* They escape down the street with the gang in pursuit, then hear a house party (not a strip club or whatever, again), and make a run for that direction. Alvins gets shot twice in the arm as they run, but they make it to the party to discover it's mostly orcs. The orcs don't react well to the cops showing up, but then bullets hit the porch and it sparks a gunfight between the orcs and the latino gang. \n\n* They try to slip through the party, but Alvins gets blood on an orc woman, who screams, and other orcs start shoving him around. Jakoby pepper sprays the whole room (covering Tikka's eyes), and they escape through a back door in the resulting chaos, running down another street.\n\n###So far, there's a lot less Bad Boys/Will Smith-isms dialogue and a lot more End of Watch or True Detective vibing going on that I'm really, really enjoying. ~~I'm gonna take a quick break, but this is page 57/105.~~\n\n#EDIT: through the gas station scene\n\n* The strike team + Gibson make it to the scene of the crash, and there's footprints of thick blood, like gasoline (remember from above?). Gibson deems that the bright (the witch Tikka mentioned earlier, I'm guessing) is coming back for the wand and they are no longer the biggest fish in the pond, and that they're going to bide their time and wait for someone to fuck up.\n\n* The feds make it to the house and one of the dick cops from the locker room tries to keep them out, but they flash their FBI 'Magic Division' badges and he crumbles, telling them everything: the bodies inside from the original call are fucked and obliterated by magic, and someone tried to clean up the cop killings, putting them into a squad car but not finishing the job. The elf notices a van across the street and runs to it, discovering that the inside has been blasted apart - it was an FBI surveillance van and the two agents inside are similarly 'magicked the fuck up.' So now it's clear that this house is important and that the FBI isn't just randomly there for the big reveal at the end or whatever.\n\n* The elf FBI guy tells the cop that they were surveilling a cult that wanted to bring the Dark Lord back and kill a bunch of people, and that it was sort of up in the air as to whether it was legit until this wand business started today - now it's all but confirmed. FBI elf steps up and has the 'Rampart-ass shit' line, and shows to be a secondary antagonist as opposed to yet another 'wait is this the bad guy too...?' character. He wants to call in FBI support and goes off to try to make that happen while the cop picks up Pollard's cell phone while on the phone with somebody else to try and get some help - for what, we don't know.\n\n* There's a quick scene of the daughter drawing a picture before bedtime at her grandmother's for Alvins with a message apologizing for being mean to him earlier (like, the 'don't be mean to Jakoby' part) and saying everything will be okay.\n\n* The cops + Tikka are at the gas station now, Alvins and Tikka are tending his wounds while Jakoby deals with a cashier that has never seen an orc in uniform. They called the sheriff from the hobo scene earlier, who is on his way. Jakoby calls back to that hobo and asks if Alvins thinks they could be in a prophecy right now (which seems less fantastic given the setting, so I'll give it that), and Alvins instead asks why Jakoby chose him to be partners. Jakoby tells him he admires Alvins and looks up to him as the ideal for what a police officer should be, 'the good cop,' and sees him as a 'blooded human' like there are blooded orcs - the real deal. See? That's fucking relationship building. Where was all this in the movie? Jakoby apologizes for lying about the orc kid and Alvins just asks that he be in the loop next time.\n\n* The sheriff shows up and holds his gun to them, as in the movie. There's less bickering between Jakoby and Alvins, and they don't play Jakoby to be an idiot showing him the wand when anyone could be dirty - because they're partners and they care about what happens. They calmly explain everything to the sheriff, who then tells his dispatch to cut out the police and call the feds and Department of Magic directly, plus an ambulance. As they continue to handle the scene realistically and try to bargain with the sheriff while the sheriff explains how fucked they are and how bad the situation looks, Gibson pops the sheriff and his chest explodes.\n", "created_utc": 1515009278.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1515011036.0, "id": "ds54y5y", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7nv683", "parent_id": "t1_ds4z426", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7nv683/bright_sequel_announced_by_netflix/ds54y5y/", "score": 19, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Chris_Parker", "author_id": "6y7n8", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Ya, they removed even more world building from the movie that essentially that they weirdly kept in the movie.

The clerk stands up from behind the counter with a revolver like he's gonna be the hero and gets popped from behind immediately by another person on the hit squad who is in a sniper position.\n\n* They fall back to a back room of the gas station, running low to avoid being shot at. This is a one-shot/continuous scene, so that would have been really neat to see (if that actually stayed in the movie, blame me for not being engaged, my b). Jakoby is about to head out the back door, but Alvins' vet tactics give him a hunch that there's a flank waiting and he stops him just as they see both 'agents' or whatever they are move to the back room. They run out the front door as the back room gets blasted with bullets.\n\n* As they escape, Jakoby once again twitch fires and kills the third 'agent' dude, who falls on his back bleeding. The other two come back around the building - still avoiding cameras - and stand by his side. He screams for help, but Gibson points out the cameras and tells him to crawl to them instead. He understands and starts crawling, trailing blood.\n\n* They keep running until the binding spell yanks Jakoby and Tikka back, and while they're on the street recovering from getting laid out by magic, two jeeps filled with orcs pull up on them. The orc gang leader is pissed about them fucking up his party and starts beating the shit out of Alvins.\n\n* The feds are still at the house - the elf is looking through the footage trying to figure out what happened while a SWAT van pulls up - that's who the cop called. The FBI guys argue about jurisdiction, and then they try to enter the house to grab the hard drives and split, but the SWAT guys block them. The elf agent tries to pull rank, and the SWAT guys open fire, killing the human agent as the elf starts doing backflips and crazy elf shit to avoid getting shot - it's nice to think of that character actually doing something in the movie. The elf grabs his laptop out of the van as they keep shooting, and some try to chase him before the SWAT leader says their orders are to guard something in the house and to let him go.\n\n* The orcs have taken our trio to an abandoned house, and the leader starts to monologue about growing up in Miami where orc communities thrived and the races coexisted peacefully, then he moved out to LA and became a bus driver and saw how torn apart the communities were and wanted to do his part to strengthen fellow orcs and empower them. He's a gang leader now, but he aims to give back to the community and throws three huge parties every year with no fighting, no guns, no issues - and they crashed one. \n\n* The interrogation is mostly the same, but they whip both cops with steel chains as the leader asks where the wand is and derides Jakoby for being the token orc friend (this comes across much less on-the-nose, since they don't saturate the dialogue with dumb 'orcs are black people, get it?' lines). They make fun of him for not being blooded and for filing his teeth, as in the movie.\n\n#Through the 'resurrection'\n\n* The cops are whipped with chains and they ask where the wand is. Tikka says there's no wand, and so they decide to take it out on the cops. They ask Jakoby where it is, and . Jakoby says there's no wand (they didn't see Tikka pick it up after the binding spell kicked in earlier), and they punch him in the face and ask again. He repeats that there's no wand, and they slash Alvins' left leg with a blade. They have a towel over his face and he screams through it. Jakoby keeps pleading that there is no wand, so the leader stabs him in the shoulder and twists the knife, saying that the latin gang was chasing them for a reason, so there must be a wand.\n\n* Alvins gets his head loose from the towel and tries to explain and corroborate that they don't have a wand, and an orc punches him in his gunshot wounds. He collapses, screaming, and the orc leader takes his knife from Jakoby's shoulder, pressing it to Tikka's throat. Alvins pleads for her safety and Jakoby yells that they're cops and they can't do this to them, and the orcs start to stomp him out, breaking his nose. \n\n* Both cops are on the ground, orc leader twists the shit out of Tikka's arm (\"wrenches,\" not sure if that's a break or what) and they crumple, Alvins tells them they don't know where the wand is. The orc leader is satisfied and moves them into another room.\n\n* This room has a pit. Like, it just goes down a few floors to the basement and you can see the bottom, it's not some giant fucking Daredevil season two hellmouth covered with a bit of plywood like a home improvement project (jesus christ that was stupid). The cops are lined up beside the pit, and we see dried, bloody chunks at the bottom. The leader wants Tikka to watch.\n\n* Alvins begs for his daughter and hopes she'll forgive him, and Jakoby is silent, except for telling the guy there's no wand and that he's stupid. Just as they're about to be executed, an orc kid stops them and has them turn over. Instead of the realization of \"oh shit it was the wrong kid, AND this is the kid!\" it's much more natural. Still, Papa Orc isn't happy about being made fun of and starts beating the shit out of Jakoby for his insolence, 'life debt' from his son be damned. The kid, and Tikka, look on in horror as the orcs stomp and kick and beat the hell out of the cops.\n\n* Later, the cops are dumped out of the back of a truck, beat to a pulp, and Tikka is tossed out with them (she wasn't beat to shit). As the truck drives off, Alvins goes to Jakoby - his leg is broken, and he's clearly fading. They can't move him - he's too big and they're too weak. Alvins starts screaming as loud as he can for help, but nobody is around.\n\n* Tikka flicks her wrist and the wand comes out of nowhere. Alvins realizes she was the Bright the whole time, and she says her role was to study magic and thwart the Dark Lord's rise. It's not her wand, a witch came to kill her and left her wand behind. She says she can help Jakoby, but not all the way - and if she does, the witch will feel the magic and know where they are. Alvins begs her to help, so she does.\n\n* Jakoby's body snaps and clicks back together as Tikka starts to bleed from the ear. He sits up, and Alvins hugs Tikka as she sinks, exhausted. Jakoby jokes the night just keeps on getting better and they share a dark chuckle, enjoying their brief respite.\n\n* But elsewhere, in an alley, there's a fucked up, veiny lady in a ratty dress leaving disgusting black footprints as she shuffles and twitches, then she whips around as she hears Tikka's magic word to heal Jakoby. She whips around and it's like some shit out of The Grudge and she goes 'mine!'", "created_utc": 1515013364.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1515015297.0, "id": "ds594lx", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7nv683", "parent_id": "t1_ds54y5y", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7nv683/bright_sequel_announced_by_netflix/ds594lx/", "score": 13, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Chris_Parker", "author_id": "6y7n8", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "\"Orcs fucking Sasha Grey\"", "created_utc": 1515008134.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "ds53sr3", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7nv683", "parent_id": "t1_ds4zu76", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7nv683/bright_sequel_announced_by_netflix/ds53sr3/", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Damn I missed it thanks for your service", "created_utc": 1515022917.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "ds5idmm", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7nv683", "parent_id": "t1_ds5i90k", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7nv683/bright_sequel_announced_by_netflix/ds5idmm/", "score": 16, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "shiningyrael", "author_id": "dwjfr", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Idk.

They hear the SWAT guys talking about holding the house down, and speculate that they've found something, as they're off-duty and using private com channels.\n\n* We're in an office in the CA State Department where a lizard dude is playing video games with a guy named Gordon. Gordon's phone starts to ring, but he's not paying attention.\n\n* The elf agent is calling him from an abandoned building. He keeps calling, hoping Gordon notices. There's a hobo dwarf that's trying to ask him if he can have his laptop and sell it for parts, since it got shot through the screen in his escape. He brushes the dwarf off.\n\n* Finally, he picks up after throwing his video game controller in defeat. The agent fills him in that it wasn't a dead lead after all and the witch is actually here and killing people, and the cult is legit, and there's a wand and a bright and gangs and rogue cops and it's a shitshow, but he has evidence, and - the dwarf takes the laptop and tries to run. The agent draws his gun and asks for it back, the dwarf panics and slams the laptop into the ground, shattering it, and runs away. There goes the evidence. He collapses, begging Gordon for help.\n\n* The trio is near a car dealership and limping but surviving. Tikka is spooked, looking out for the witch - the others are more concerned about getting home. Jakoby can't let go of how the orc kid he let go happened to be there - Alvins chalks it up to coincidence, Jakoby believes it has to be a prophecy. He can't shake how strange it is, cause that shit doesn't happen anymore and they're just normal, the 'little people.'\n\n* Alvins is skeptical, but it's keeping Jakoby's mind right so he lets it happen. starts talking about an old prophecy about an unblooded orc named Jirak that fought against the Dark Lord when he learned his intent to destroy the world. He united the orc armies and fulfilled the great prophecy, and was blooded as a result of his bravery. Alvins still thinks it's just one bad night.\n\n* They make it to the lot, and Alvins tries to get the woman in the dealership office to open the door for them as Tikka sees a flickering light that tells her the witch is here. As Alvins continues to plead, somebody whistles - he turns to see Salinas and the rest of the gang surrounding them. He asks for Tikka and the wand, and Tikka steps forward.\n\n* She holds the wand up to use it, and the lights at the dealership go out, but something's wrong. The wand is giving off heat distortions and shit, and Salinas orders his boys to kill them - but they're all mangled and dead, blood everywhere. The witch is already there.\n\n* She tears out Salinas' throat and stands there, ugly and scary as fuck. The cops share a legit funny moment, beat to shit and barely able to stand, as they react to this as if it were just some criminal in front of them (\"She seems noncompliant,\" \"Yeah, I'm getting that too.\"). Jakoby asks if this is finally it, if they're gonna die now. Alvins says \"if that's what it takes,\" asking if Jakoby's with him. Jakoby says yes, and Tikka steps between them and blasts the witch with a spell.\n\n* The witch deflects the spell and yanks her into the air, the cops grab hold of her and try to get the wand. They both grab it, and the witch pulls them along with it like tug of war. They're straining as hard as they can, bleeding from the palms, and the witch is just cackling. Alvins lets go with one hand, grabs his Taser, and bops her in the face/neck, and she stops pulling the wand.\n\n* Jakoby takes that as cue to pull his service weapon and unloads into her. He reloads (a lot of hits, a lot of misses hitting the cars behind her and setting off alarms), and the witch is hurt but still standing. They realize the both dropped the wand, and Alvins dives for it - he gets dragged across the pavement toward the witch. Jakoby finishes reloading and pops her twice in the dome, and she falls.\n\n* Jakoby collapses back onto the hood of a car and the alarm goes off. His consciousness is fading in and out, but he can't find Tikka anywhere. Alvins is laying on the ground - he flops over, and the pavement tore him up. Jakoby reaches for Alvins, but gives up. Alvins still has the wand, but he can't find Tikka either.\n\n* They wonder where she could have ran, and decide the only option would be 'home,' since she's just a kid. They're obviously not wanting to track her down, saying that they can leave, the binding spell is broken, they can go to the hospital - but Tikka is still out there and in danger. After all, Alvins is the good cop. Jakoby sees him make the call-back joke, but Alvins clarifies that his whole life, people ran out on him, and says the buck stops with him. Someone has to be the good guy. Fuckin character, man. They agree to go back to the house\n\n#Through the climax at the house\n\n* Back at the house, the SWAT dudes got wrecked. The whole street is fucked, and Alvins/Jakoby come across body after body. Alvins heads inside the house while Jakoby grabs a shotgun and goes around the back - but the sniper from before is following him.\n\n* The dude that got blasted is chilling silently on the couch, barely alive, as Alvins sneaks by him. There's a noise in the kitchen, and Alvins and Gibson both make their way toward it - unaware of each others' presence. Jakoby is still getting tailed, and the dying guy is still on the couch. Tikka is the one in the kitchen, hiding, and she sees Alvins but not Gibson - she tries to get his attention, but the guy on the couch sees and calls for Gibson to alert her. \n\n* Alvins kills couch guy (finally), and he and Gibson spot each other. She shoots him twice in the chest as he shoots the side of her face, and they both drop. Tikka runs to Alvins, and Gibson shoots her in the back. Alvins aims at Gibson, who threatens to kill Tikka and warns him not to shoot. Jakoby comes around the corner, and Alvins stops him from shooting Gibson, who is now getting to her feet.\n\n* She sees her partner moving behind Jakoby and gets Alvins to drop his gun and move to the kitchen table. He's absolutely fucked, but before she can even ask where the wand is, he asks who the fuck she is. She says she represents a 'larger interest,' saying the dirty cop from the initial cop killings called that interest, and that Alvins made a mistake, choosing the wrong side. She says she's going to kill them both, take the wand, and dip. Jakoby sees that he's been flanked just as sirens and lights flash outside.\n\n* The FBI guys are pulling up in big ass SUVs and are surrounding the house, ordering to kill anybody inside with a gun.\n\n* Gibson is shook, and Alvins says as soon as she lowers the gun, Jakoby should take the shot. Alvins reveals that the wand was up his sleeve and points it at Gibson, who seems tickled and intrigued rather than concerned. Alvins tells Jakoby to get Tikka, but Jakoby keeps asking what the fuck he's doing, and Alvins says not to worry - it's a prophecy, right? Jakoby asks if he really believes it, and Alvins says 'no, but you do.'\n\n* Jakoby gets Tikka carefully as Gibson starts fuming, reprimanding Alvins about being born a Bright or having to study, and that he's a fool for what he's even considering. They're in a standoff, Gibson trying to get into his head and Alvins telling her to shut up and her partner asking what to do and her telling him to shut up and Gibson lunges for the wand - Alvins repeats the magic word he heard Tikka say at the dealership and the whole room explodes into fire. He's blown back while the wand explodes and Gibson melts into a flaming skeleton.\n\n* The explosion stuns the FBI guys, except for the elf agent. I guess he's just hard like that.\n\n* Jakoby sees the last hit squad dude square up and he blasts him with the shotty back into the fire.  He can't see Alvins, but he can grab Tikka, so he helps her up and makes for the door while calling for his partner. He stumbles out of the door carrying her as an FBI/SWAT dude yells at him and starts to fire, but the elf agent knocks his gun away and tells the men to fucking help them. They take Tikka, and Jakoby almost collapses.\n\n* Jakoby tries to turn to head back into the house, but the elf stops him. Jakoby says it has to be a prophecy, something bigger, but he's super dazed and can barely stand. The elf tries to get him medical attention, but Jakoby keeps yelling for Alvins, telling them he needs help and that his best friend is still in that building. He breaks down in tears, then asks if he can hear him inside with his improved elf ears or whatever. He says Alvins is dead, but Jakoby roars that he's a liar and shoves him away, running toward the house.\n\n* Jakoby is getting roasted by the flames inside, searching for Alvins - he finally finds his body behind a collapsed wall Jakoby picks him up and leaps through the window they were getting shot at earlier in the day. The crowd outside cheers for them, but Alvins still looks dead. Jakoby drags him clear and starts tending to him, asking if he's okay. Alvins' eyes are opening, staring deadly out into the distance - then he raises his hand and points, telling Jakoby to look.\n\n* Behind Jakoby, the orc gang is standing in a line. The leader raises his hand and cuts it with a blade - the same blooding thing from the ceremony at the end of the movie, but way more powerful now. Jakoby starts to weep, overcome with emotion. He turns back to Alvins, but Alvins looks gone.", "created_utc": 1515019996.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "ds5frsw", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7nv683", "parent_id": "t1_ds594lx", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7nv683/bright_sequel_announced_by_netflix/ds5frsw/", "score": 8, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Chris_Parker", "author_id": "6y7n8", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Sounds like a character will smith played,  I dunno,  in I, robot....", "created_utc": 1515004176.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "ds4ztnu", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7nv683", "parent_id": "t1_ds4vxaj", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7nv683/bright_sequel_announced_by_netflix/ds4ztnu/", "score": 312, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "elchupahombre", "author_id": "hwgb1", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I honestly think the twist might be that they're both Brights.

Interestingly, when the cops are beating down that orc on the hood of the police car, not only is there a centaur cop in the background, but there's also a human cop on horseback.  \n\nThe sword guy makes a statement that there was an army of 9 races fighting against the Dark Lord. So far the movie has referenced 5 or shown:  \n\n1. Humans\n2. Elves\n3. Dwarves\n4. Centaurs\n5. Unnamed Lizard people\n\nThe Fogteeth boss orc makes a reference to dwarves partying with them in Miami, although no dwarf is shown to my knowledge.  \n\nThe lizard people have at least two references in the opening credits. There's the crosswalk sign showing a bipedal creature with a long face, and there's some graffiti with the Dark Lord holding up 4 humanoids by nooses: a human, elf, dwarf, and some humanoid with a thick, long tail. Presumably the lizard people.  \n\nFinally, and this is hard to see, in the scene with the sword guy in the street, look deep in the background standing on the sidewalk of the street to the right. There are two cloaked humanoids, very tall -- possibly 7' tall, with long faces. This matches up with the graffiti and crosswalk sign, so are probably the lizard people. They're definitely not elf, orc, human, or centaur.  \n\nTagging /u/_Rand_ /u/CarsonCityCrooner and /u/ultimatecaissie since they seemed interested and I can only tag three.  \n\nedit: Someone asked if there is a thread with screenshots supporting all this.

There's also a woman who appears to be a human with dwarfism on stage in the strip club.  \n\nIt's very possible they are meant to be the dwarfs mentioned by the orc, and one of the 9 races, but they seem to be following fairly standard fantasy tropes with the design of their races, so I'd expect that the dwarf race is bulky, strong, and more stout. The fact that the small person in the locker room doesn't have a beard doesn't exclude him from being a dwarf and dwarfs from being bearded, since Jakoby is also missing a piece of his racial identity with removed tusks.  \n\nHard to say. I'm expecting they'll give some clarity about dwarfs in the sequel, if not in a trailer.  \n\nedit: honestly the human from the magical task force that is partnered with that elf looks more like a fantasy dwarf than the humans with dwarfism shown in the movie, but that guy is 6' tall, so can be ruled out.", "created_utc": 1515006838.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "ds52hnh", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7nv683", "parent_id": "t1_ds5244b", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7nv683/bright_sequel_announced_by_netflix/ds52hnh/", "score": 6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "notlogic", "author_id": "cb987", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Her?", "created_utc": 1515004755.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "ds50erd", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7nv683", "parent_id": "t1_ds4y7bv", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7nv683/bright_sequel_announced_by_netflix/ds50erd/", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "greensickpuppy89", "author_id": "yur3m", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Well oil is black gold, and we all know dwarves love their gold.\n\nWait is saying black gold also racist?", "created_utc": 1515002581.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "ds4ya0x", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7nv683", "parent_id": "t1_ds4xx01", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7nv683/bright_sequel_announced_by_netflix/ds4ya0x/", "score": 28, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "mangongo", "author_id": "f4qnz", "subreddit_name": "movies"}]
