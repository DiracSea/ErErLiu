I feel it would be so, so, SO unfitting for such a major and important character to just be written off or die off-screen... and that's not what Carrie would want I reckon. From watching her interviews, she LOVED the character of Leia dearly and it seems she would want the character to have a proper end.\n\n\nWe have the technology to do it now. Just look at Tarkin and Leia in Rogue One. They (mainly Tarkin) still had a bit of a way to go, yes, but the technology will be much better by 2019. Just look at the strides we've made since Paul Walker died, they had him sit in the background do nothing and have action scenes in the dark whereas Tarkin and Leia were full on in Rogue One, that's incredible progress and it's only getting better. **Additionally** Carrie approved of her CGI self in Rogue One, so she's not completely against the practice.\n\n\nFrom reading what Lucasfilm have said, I don't think they've 100% confirmed there's not going to be a CGI Princess Leia. If there was absolutely no chance, they would straight up say there will not be a CGI Leia. Plans change so saying \"no plans\" gives them the room to, in the future, make plans.\n\n\nI just want the character to have a proper send off like Han got to, or Luke will have (and it doesn't have to be to the level she was originally going to appear in Ep. 9 necessarily). If they can do it without CGI, great!!!
