Then there is ch 11, which is similar to the first half, but with a difference. Basically, it says that you have run out of liquid assets, but you can still cover your debt with illiquid assets, you just need to sell them off. For example, If I had 1 million in cash, 5 million in debt, and 15 million invested in real estate,I could file ch 11 and show that I'm good for the money, I just need some time to sell my properties. This isn't a scheme like tanking the company to buy it with an \"unrelated one\" and dodge debts and taxes if that's the case, and honestly the confusion pops up enough that they may want to consider changing the name.

It creates hostility towards law and legal procedures that are, when understood, actually very fair.
