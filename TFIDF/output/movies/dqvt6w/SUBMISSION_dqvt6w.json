Save it for the end and you can have a really gutteral gut punch especially if you focus on the human protagonists reaction to their role in the Apocalypse.\n\nPlus you can drop really fun hints with The Terminator trying hard to relate to the human protag but being completely unable to because Skynet can't comprehend how human's think and react.", "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "title": "I kinda want to see a Reverse Terminator movie where Skynet sends a Terminator back to protect one of it's creators while the Human Resitance sends someone back in time to kill them.", "url": null, "author_name": "MiracleAlien", "author_id": "1tbtipke", "subreddit_name": "movies", "upvote_ratio": 0.9}
