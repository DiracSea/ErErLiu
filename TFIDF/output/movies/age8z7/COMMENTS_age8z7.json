Kidding kidding. \n\nThe director explains what he wants the scene to be. From what the actors are to get across, to the general feel of the scene. \n\nProducers are supposed to produce everything needed. The actors, the props, the location for the director. \n\nSo the director says I want a baseball bat to hit the back of this guy's head and have his left eye pop out. This happens in a baseball field and I want the victim to be begging for his life as it happens. \n\nThe producer then has to get the location. Be it an actual baseball field or a green screen. Get the special FX to be CGI or conventional, get the actors involved (victim and whoever is swinging the bat). This has to be done on the budget of the producer. Now the producer may tell the director that a scene needs to be a certain way because if cost and in worst case scenarios a scene is just cut. \n\nOnce the producer brings everything needed to the best of his ability to make the scene happen. The director gets everything and shoots the scene. He gives more detailed explanation of what he wants to everyone involved and  we have a scene.

If I read it correctly and assuming it's accurate, just for that movie alone Shyamalan got:\n\n* $7.2M for story rights\n* $0.3M for screenwriting services\n* $2.5M as producer\n* $0.2M as director (scale)\n\nSo that's $10.2M total (plus any backend, if his deal included a backend), just for The Village.\n\nHe also reportedly got paid $5M for the screenplay (by which I assume the story rights and the screenplay services) for his previous movie Unbreakable.\n\nBetween Unbreakable and The Village he made Signs. If he got at least $5M for Unbreakable and $10M for The Village, it makes sense that he got paid somewhere between $5M and $10M for Signs.\n\nSo he probably earned $20M or more just from those three movies. Even after agents, managers, taxes and living expenses, that's not a bad stash to have.\n\nThen he wrote and/or directed another six movies between The Village and Split. Sure by then his reputation had started to tank, but my guess is that he'd still command low seven (maybe high six) figure deals for most of these.\n\nSo even before Split came around I think he was in a very comfortable position.

While I agree that Unbreakable is his best. I think The story and the characters in The Sixth Sense don't get enough credit and it's not far behind. Too many get caught up on the twist, but the twist is only one piece of the narrative. The real emotional through line, and the one that makes me tear up every time I see the film, is Cole's relationship with his mother and how she knows there is something wrong with her son, but because he can't communicate with her and they can't communicate with each other, she's lost and is falling apart. \n\nWhat I also love about the piece, is how the ghost narrative not only highlights the films central conflicts, but it adds tension and sadness to them. For example, the narrative in one sense is a ticking bomb for the characters because Vincent represents who Cole could very well become without Malcolm's help. Then you have other ticking bombs all around them, the side story about the step mother who poisoned her step daughter to death for example and was starting on the younger one. \n\nThe twist was indeed great, but the film holds together so well because of just how strong and powerful the characters are and their central conflicts that he has set up. It's not the reveal that I keep coming back to with that film. It's scenes like the consequence of that reveal, when you see him talk to his wife at the end and tell her how much he loves her and says \"you were never second\", or the sadness in the ghost girls eyes, and the look of devastation when the father finds out that his wife poisoned his little girl to death. Or that entire scene when Cole tells his mother about what happened to the \"Bumblebee Pendant\".  These are what I remember and what never fail to tear me up. \nThis is what I feel Shyamalan has lost over the years. He has forgotten to truly get in the head of the characters, instead he looks at the films in more of a mechanical way. X=Y, this character moves here cause...plot, and the best examples of him truly getting in to the characters head space in a incredible way is these two films.
