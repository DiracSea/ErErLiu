I always think of Kathy Griffith holding trump\u2019s severed head whenever these discussions come up.\n\nIMO, comedy stages are \u201ca safe space\u201d of sorts.

The audience does not have to be there or like it, but taking your set out of context and blasting it to the public is pretty unacceptable to me. BUT...\n\nPart of the agreement is that the comedian has to demonstrate they *earned* it. Dave, skin color aside, has *earned* the right to say basically anything and everything about race because all of his work demonstrates a very intelligent, nuanced understanding of race and race relations. If he takes a pot shot or easy gag at someone\u2019s expense, it usually serves a larger purpose, so we the audience assume there\u2019s more to it. He\u2019s earned the benefit of the doubt when a joke doesn\u2019t land or seems off. An example being \u201cThe Niggar Family\u201d sketch. That was an incredible depiction and breakdown of 1950\u2019s suburban white America. The joke and punchline is super crass/basic, but the context is nuanced and earnest. \n\nKathy Griffith, on the other hand, had no point to her act. It was shock rock at best, tasteless opportunism at worst. I think there are plenty of comedians who could\u2019ve done exactly what she did without the fallout, but that\u2019s because they earned it (and vice versa: many others would have also been called out and shamed for it).
