Yes he's a magical negro stereotype. Didn't Green Mile get nominated and win a bunch of awards? In 2000?\n\nFirst of all, the boy's father is leaving him at the grandma's plantation with his mother because he has to live in the city for a time due to his \"controversial editorship\" in Atlanta. I would theorize the father is probably a forward-thinker if he is controversial in those days.\n\nThe rest of the story is basically the boy hates being there so he goes off to leave the plantation and Uncle Remus prevents him from doing so by keeping him busy with songs and stories of African American slave/sharecropper cultural relevance (which is apparently one of the \"racist\" points against it).\n\nThe boy's mom gets mad at Remus because she mistakes his intention and asks him to stay away from him. That's not portrayed as anything positive or negative, just a mom looking out for her son and probably being a bit racist behind it, although she seems to consider that Remus kept the boy from going too far astray.\n\nThe boy continues to struggle with life there and Remus intervenes in a fight that the main character gets involved in after 2 boys push a girl in the mud. Then Remus tells the two kids a story to cheer them up. Mom gets mad at Remus, again, not necessarily for a \"racist\" reason but because she thinks he is the reason her kid missed his own birthday party and thinks the stories are why her kid is getting into trouble. She doesn't know the whole story. Uncle Remus decides to *leave on his own accord* because he feels he has become a bother. AKA he is NOT a slave like so many people seem to believe, he is in all likelihood a share-cropper. The boy rushes off to persuade him not to go and the boy gets injured by a bull. The boy asks for uncle Remus, who reads stories to him while he fights for his life and the boy ends up surviving. The mom shows gratitude.\n\nYes, there are cliches and stereotypes endemic to a film funded and filmed by white people about black culture. However, uncle Remus wasn't just some white guy in Black face. That was huge. The boy learned about a part of black culture he might have never been allowed to even be aware of in those days. That was huge.  Mom adjusted her perceptions, and was open-minded enough not to go super-saiyan racist even when she thought Uncle Remus was a bad influence. That was huge as well.\n\nSo I simply DO NOT GET the accusations that it's a racist movie. If anything it's the opposite of that, despite stumbling a bit on the culture of the time and it truly stands out above those very stumbling blocks. I know it's not Disney but Bugs Bunny did blackface and my kid can stream that on Amazon Prime any time (I don't actually know if THAT particular episode is available). Disney is honestly hurting itself by making SotS so difficult to watch. I think a lot of black people would find interest in that movie if they could just watch it and form their own opinions.\n\nedit: I wanted to add that  James Baskett was the FIRST African-American to receive an Academy Award and Disney is in effect ERASING black history by vaulting SotS.", "created_utc": 1571941075.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1571941677.0, "id": "f51hmhe", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_dmh84n", "parent_id": "t1_f51865c", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/dmh84n/disney_is_quietly_placing_classic_fox_movies_into/f51hmhe/", "score": 45, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "SuspiciousArtist", "author_id": "2fix9lqs", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I've only heard of uncle Remus via frank zappa", "created_utc": 1571939339.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "f51bbna", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_dmh84n", "parent_id": "t1_f51865c", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/dmh84n/disney_is_quietly_placing_classic_fox_movies_into/f51bbna/", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Terryfink", "author_id": "gsk3n", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "You're thinking of the one called Brear Rabbit and the tar babies.
