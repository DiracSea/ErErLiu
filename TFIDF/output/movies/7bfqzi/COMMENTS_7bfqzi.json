The accusation is that selective banning as retaliation over a publication doing their job is economic interference.

There is nothing in the article to begin with that could be seen as slanderous, because it basically only gives actual facts. And even if you took Disney's side on that part of the argument, questioning journalistic integrity has other avenues to be addressed, and the issue of add based financing and the result on journalistic integrity is gigantic enough without attacking other journalists for standing up against one of those practices.\n\nThe video is basically a bait and switch. He disagrees with journalists siding with journalists, and the only argument he basically gives is \"Disney is can obviously do it\". Which is true, but is not an argument why the Journalists also should do what they can.
