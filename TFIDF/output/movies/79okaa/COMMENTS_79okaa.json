I had the exact same feeling while rewatching TFA a few days ago. And it's not just Rey. All of the core 3 characters (Finn, Poe, Rey) are massively overpowered and seem to get their way with no threat or danger. Finn somehow knows how to wield a lightsaber in his first battle and is even able to duel Kylo despite being a \"non-force user\". Poe is able to take out 20 tie fighters and storm troopers within the span of seconds, and then hits all 8 cylinders in starkiller base with lightning fast speed and precision. Rey meanwhile can fly the falcon, use the force and wield a lightsaber well enough to defeat kylo ren on her first try. \n\nThe whole movie is just ridiculous. Leia ignoring Chewie is the least of the crap that's in there. You have captain Phasma getting taken down in the span of 2 seconds by Finn and then gives up the shield to the entire base without any retaliation. You have Rey climbing around the walls of the starkiller base in a wide open area and the only people who see her are Finn and Han. You have the first order which is able to blow up 6 planets at once, and then struggles to fight off a tiny group of x wings. Finally you have kylo ren who can stop a laser in mid air, but apparently can't beat Rey in either force manipulation or lightsaber skills.
