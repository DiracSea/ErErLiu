In fact Frozen is a perfect example of how trailers for kids films evolve. First trailer is the cutesy/merchandise stuff, Second was more about the Anna and Hans adventure with the Ice/Elsa aspect seeming more like a macguffin, and then the third trailer sold the hell out of Elsa and the music (i.e. the stuff that makes frozen interesting).  I believe the strategy is basically:\n\n a) first hook the kids, they are your core audience, advertise it so that they'll beg their parents to see it \n\nb) next trailer provide basic set-up, remind kids of funny stuff\n\n c) Sell it for the adults, make it look interesting to them, after all they are the ones buying the tickets.
