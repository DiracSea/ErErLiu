[{"body": "The craziest thing about silent movie effects is that everything basically had to be done in camera.\n\nIf you were filming multiple elements to create a complex shot that [contained multiple elements](http://i.imgur.com/U4EcrMM.gifv) and you messed up one part, the whole piece of film would be ruined.\n\nThere are a lot of other cool techniques that I didn't include. Maybe the most cutting edge one was the [Schufftan process](http://metropolisvixfx.blogspot.ca/2007/10/schufftan-process.html), which Metropolis was the [first film to use](http://i.imgur.com/szx1YRE.gifv).\n\nAnother simple, but very effective trick, was suspending miniature models in front of the camera. [These huge machines from Modern Times](http://i.imgur.com/FpLAA0C.gifv) were actual models hung carefully in front of the camera to create a trick of perspective.\n\nAnd maybe one of the most famous special effects shots of the silent era, the [parting of the Red Sea](http://i.imgur.com/Ffi8OA9.gifv) in the Cecil B. DeMille's original version of the Ten Commandments (1923) was actually pretty straight forward: Water was poured into a gelatin mold made to look like the sea, and the result footage was reversed to make it look like the water was rushing out.\n\nXpost /r/silentmoviegifs\n\nEDIT:\n\nIf you're interested in stuff like this, here's another collection of GIFs I put together:\n\n[Scenes from famous movies inspired by silent films](http://imgur.com/a/853Cm)", "created_utc": 1483780584.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1483817812.0, "id": "dc434p9", "is_submitter": true, "link_id": "t3_5mjomm", "parent_id": "t3_5mjomm", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/5mjomm/how_some_cool_silent_film_effects_were_done/dc434p9/", "score": 2785, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Auir2blaze", "author_id": "cvuq7", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "God, these are fascinating.\n\nOne thing that should be considered with Harold Lloyd: he was badly injured by a prop bomb in 1919, and lost his thumb and index finger.

The reason is because a Technicolor camera is actually three cameras in one - each one is configured to catch a specific color - red, green, or blue. So you have 3x the amount of color information than a normal piece of single-strip color film like the Kodak Vision stocks used today:\n\nhttp://www.digital-intermediate.co.uk/examples/3strip/technicolor.htm\n\nDigital cameras have done very well for themselves in many ways. The light sensitivity is much much better than film and has been for some time. We've finally begun to lick dynamic range in terms of how many steps of grey the sensors can see between black and white. But we have yet to come up with the best in terms of color reproduction. Part of that is on purpose, the advantage of digital cinematography is that you can shoot it \"flat\" and bring out the color later in digital post, whereas in film you generally want to get a lot of it done \"in camera\" with some attention paid to chemical processes afterwards (like bleach bypass, etc). So cinematographers aren't really trying to recreate the Technicolor look. But even if they wanted to, a fresh 3 strip Technicolor print is still miles richer and deeper in color than the state-of-the-art Arri Alexa sensors. It hasn't been a priority in sensor design because aesthetically that super saturated Technicolor look isn't something people want in their films, and because the tools we have to tease out color digitally are pretty effing great.\n\nIn addition, here are some possible reasons why your Technicolor experiences haven't been great:\n\n1) Film strip degradation - the film itself is prone to fade and change (to be fair Technicolor films are much more robust than other color processes), so it's possible your technicolor strip was just in real bad shape when you saw it.\n\n2) Poor video transfer - If you saw your Technicolor movie on a video screen, a lot of movies have terrible video transfers. They just put it on the machine and let it run without really configuring it properly for that specific movie. When you get a Criterion Blu Ray of The Red Shoes that's not an issue, you get an absolutely gorgeous rendition of the film, but for a random DVD of some Western that isn't considered a classic they just run it through. Even the popular movies sometimes get shit transfers - the Star Wars trilogy digital transfers are notoriously terrible (far too much magenta).\n\n3) You weren't watching actual Technicolor - Technicolor is a company and a brand. Their claim to fame is the 3-strip Technicolor process, but after that faded from popularity and people shot flims in regular color film instead (mainly because the 3 strip camera is the size of a small car), Technicolor the company became more of a film processing lab and color correction specialist for movies shot on film. So a movie that hired them to do the color correction on their film could have \"color by Technicolor\" on their credits without it actually being a 3 strip Technicolor film.\n\nFinal thought - one time I was touring a film archive and they had a ton of old prints from various places in different states of disrepair - some were warped, some were close to turning to dust, some had massive color fading. I was able to examine a print of Fantasia up close. And while the print was unprojectable because it was warped, the colors on those frames were still [pitch perfect, deep and true](http://imgur.com/OVRO1kj).

This was a tv show, not a movie.  For some perspective on how different the costs of producing tv versus producing a movie: The budget per 45 minute episode of the first season (1987) of TNG was 1.3 million dollars, a very large budget for one-hour TV.  The budget for Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home (1986) was 24 million, but came in under budget at 21 million.  That's $28,888/minute of TNG versus $172,131/minute of Final Frontier.\n\nYou are assuming that the initial investment is the only significant cost built into a hydraulic chassis effect.  The operating costs would not be negligible, particularly because of the safety issues of using a moving set and the resulting insurance cost rise.  Increased safety measures would also add to the amount of time required, compounding all the costs of crew, which are paid by the amount of time worked.\n\nAlso, you are talking about building a hydraulic chassis for ONE setting on a spaceship.  Space battles don't just happen in one part of the ship.  Off the top of my head, the other Enterprise sets on TNG were the ready room, the conference room, ten forward, the engineering section, the cargo bay, the crew quarters, sick bay, the transporter room, the holodeck, the turbo lifts, the corridors and the jeffries tubes.  Not all of these are standing sets, but many of them were because they were used so often.  Do hydraulic chassis need to be designed and built for every set on TNG?  \n\nAnd since you mentioned it as a problem in canon, I agree, those inertial dampeners sure went offline a lot.  However, give Star Trek some dramatic license here.

There has been a dramatic, palpable shift in the 21st century away from \"cinematic storytelling\" as we knew it. Digital cameras and digital color correction have played their part, but general assumptions about film and pacing have changed irrevocably as well.\n\nI think I once heard Scorcese in an interview refer to this trend as \"the disappearance of the shot;\" movies are no longer pieced together from distinct, photographic compositions designed to impress or make a statement. Instead, overwhelming emphasis is now placed on \"flow.\" Notice how so many movies today employ constant handheld, crane, dolly, and gliding shots-- you never want the audience to \"settle\" into a single moment, the goal is always to get to the next story beat. Fast cutting is the norm--  shots disappear into other shots, scenes blend together; many films today employ a kind of \"stream of consciousness\" editing style, and glue everything together with \"beds\" of music laid underneath.\n\nThe theory is that the audience is not supposed to notice any individual filmmaking choice; all shots and edits must be invisible, must disappear beneath the story. You can see this quite clearly in the work of mainstream directors like JJ Abrams, Christopher Nolan, Michael Bay, and pretty much all Marvel / Disney blockbusters-- there are attempts at memorable moments of action, memorable pieces of content in the frame, but there is no attempt at \"memorable shots\" or compositions-- everything blends.\n\nThis stands in stark contrast to big Hollywood movies of days past, which would go to great lengths to impress with strong, striking formalistic choices: think of the [famous hard cut from Lawrence of Arabia](https://scottross79.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/635bd-arabiacutedited.jpg?w=720), or the [perfectly life-sized Patton in front of the American flag](http://www.grouchoreviews.com/content/films/3093/1.jpg). Famous directors like Ford or Welles would try to fill their films with \"[great](http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-11-23-1448302924-3834633-the_searchers.jpg) [shots](http://writing2.richmond.edu/writing/wweb/filmstudies/images/lowangle.jpg),\" and the purpose of editing was to bring out interesting relationships between these shots.\n\nNowadays, choices like this are seen to be \"cheesy,\" or \"artsy,\" or \"take people out of the film,\" whereas before it was just considered good, mainstream filmmaking.\n\nI know exactly what you mean about 70s / 80s B movies-- on some fundamental level, they were still *films*, made from individual shots. They may have been bad shots, or silly shots, but there was still an attempt to engage on a traditionally visual, cinematic level.
