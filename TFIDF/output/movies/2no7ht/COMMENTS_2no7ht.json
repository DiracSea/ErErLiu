I wonder if it's just an overpowered lightsaber or if it's a new take on the lightsaber effect by making it more unstable looking than the normally pristine clean blades from the previous trilogies. My guess is the antagonist has an amped up saber that can do more crazy stuff and has a unique look to go with it rather than just being another \"evil red bad guy saber!\"\n\nI thought the inclusion of the short side blades was weird at first, but the more I thought about it the more I realized that their inclusion makes the lightsaber both significantly more dangerous offensively and defensively. With the original styling you had a case where one of three things could hypothetically happen if two lightsabers clashed in line with each other: 1. the defending person would have to pivot at angle to completely block the attack, 2. the attacking blade would glance the side of the defense blade and still continue downward toward the target, or 3. the blades would stick and the opponents would be saber locked. With the guards on the sides the defensive window of the lightsaber is dramatically increased and can serve to better block an inline attack, and the guard itself is also dangerous as they are presumably just as effective offensively as the main blade itself, allowing for more diverse methods of attack.\n\nIn summary, I am a gigantic nerd.

Lucas was the director of ANH and while there were people around him moderating some of his work, he was still the primary creative force behind its production from script to production. He is the person who saw that the original film was on its way to being a trainwreck, did reshoots and replaced his editor because the result was bad, it wasn't a good film *despite* him, it was a good film *because of* him. He was the driving force behind so many of the decisions which resulted in a good film, just because there are versions of the script which suck and scenes that were shot which don't work doesn't undermine the fact that the film which released was good and he was largely responsible for that.\n\nLucas was a good director back in the day. Obviously he got worse (as almost all directors do it should be noted, none of the great sci-fi directors of the 70s and 80s have replicated their success in the same way since) but that doesn't undermine the fact that he produced, directed and wrote several great films.
