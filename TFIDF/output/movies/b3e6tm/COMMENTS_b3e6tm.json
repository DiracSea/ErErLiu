I say to my friend, \"Dude that is totally Alex Winter.\" She had no clue who I meant until I told her he'd been in the Bill & Ted movies.\n\n She didn't believe me, so I said I was gonna go say hi. I walk over, tap him on the shoulder, and say, \"Excuse me, are you Alex Winter?\" He says, \"Yes I am!\" So me, being the polite southern gal, tell him I hoped I wasn't bothering him but I wanted to say hi, hoped he was having a good time in Little Rock, and that I always thought he was awesome in Lost Boys (cuz y'know, totally had a crush on him). He was super nice, said thank you, and I let him go back to his friends. I didn't want to encroach on his personal time.\n\nMy friend couldn't believe I had the guts to walk up to him and start a conversation, but I am glad i did. Later that night we happened to walk by Sticky Fingerz (as it was called back then) and saw Legendary Shack Shakers were playing. I told my friends we absolutely HAD to go watch them - so I rocked out up by the band singing with them while the others were hanging back drinking (cuz they didn't know who the hell Legendary Shack Shakers were).
