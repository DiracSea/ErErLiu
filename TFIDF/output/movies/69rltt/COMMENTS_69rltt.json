The reason why movies used to have two or three trailers but now have six or seven is because theaters charge to show trailers.\n\nOnce upon a time, when the average production cost for a film was south of $25 million, give or take, studios created trailers and handed them to theaters who would show them for free, driving future ticket sales that benefited both parties.\n\nNow, with cable TV, video games, the interwebz, piracy and 50 million other things competing for people's entertainment time and dollar, everyone has to squeeze even harder to wring out every last bit of disposable income before someone else gets to it.\n\nStudios started by charging a sliding film rental fee that could be 90:10 in the studio's favor during the opening week, on down to 30:70 in the theater's favor after three or four months. I'm not sure, but I remember reading that 100% of the gate for the Star Wars prequels went to Fox in during opening week, which is fucking nuts considering that films make half their money during week one. In the past, audiences were used to a much slower build-up, and one out of every four or five dollars was earned the first week.\n\nSliding fees squeeze theaters. Charging exorbitant fees for bits of sugar can only go so far when fewer than half of your patrons visits a concession stand, so you need to find other sources of revenue. Aha! Marketing has become supreme in driving that first week rush that favors the studio's pricing strategy, so the theater puts an end to free trailers and starts charging $100k to carry a trailer across the chain for a couple weeks. Not only that, but theaters sign deals for even more money for stuff like key locations (TCL Chinese Theater in Hollywood has way more prestige than the Westminster Regency 9 in OC), marketing materials (if I'm charging you to show trailers, I'm for damn sure charging you to put up those cardboard standup displays), and co-branding (you can put your logo on my drink cup).\n\nStudios will put up with this shit because while they want to get your money in the theater, they really want to get it downstream too. The biggest factor in how much HBO pays to show your film is its box office performance. They don't really care whether you're comfortable as a filmgoer, having to sit through all that shit. In fact, they prefer it, since the very act of going to the movies identifies you as their core audience, and they want you to see their advertisements.\n\nSo why don't theaters just show fewer trailers and add an extra showing? Because obviously, they make more showing the trailers, otherwise, they wouldn't do it, would they? When big movies open, you can go down to the nearest multiplex and see that it's showing on two or even three screens already.

Just play it safe. Luckily my country (Canada) made some efforts to actively protect pirates, or at least make copyright infringements not worth it financially to the companies who pursue them.\n\n\n*TL;DR -- Going after Kodi or Plex is bad business.*\n\n\n(eyes the rules sidebar carefully) ... Background: I am an information technology professional with over twenty years experience. Information presented here is from professional experience within that field, and is not legal advice or opinion, or an endorsement of (or against) piracy. It doesn't matter what the sentence is. People don't factor punishment into the decision-making process (this is true of most crime, ask any crim law major). What drives piracy is economics and convenience, nothing else. If I had a news article or wiki to explain the dynamics here, I'd dispense the link and be done with this. But it's complicated, and controversial, and political, and so there isn't much written about it in a dispassionate and objective fashion. I will dispense an explanation on the economics now, and leave moral judgements and what-not to you, the reader. \n\nPeople who have the discretionary income to buy lots of dvds and blu ray rarely pirate -- and if they do, it's because of the aforementioned problems with going to the theatre (and a few other convenience-related considerations, which I'll get to). If they do it's driven by convenience, not economics -- and they'll probably buy a legit copy once it's released months later. Probably the director's cut, extended edition, remasters, and more as well. They are, afterall, junkies. Which makes sense: If you're a movie junkie you probably don't want to wait months to see whatever is blowing up right now. \n\n\nThat just leaves the people who *don't* have the discretionary income. They aren't interested in Plex or Kodi, for the most part. When Netflix started to get big, and before the market fragmented, the piracy statistics dropped right through the floor. It was cheap, convenient, and a value-added service. Ten bucks a month? Every college kid coast to coast could afford *that* -- and Netflix also quickly blew bittorrent out of the water on the internet backbone for aggregate bandwidth usage. Piracy online, as far as the general public was concerned, very nearly died right then and there. But the market fragmented as all the distributors started jacking off with licensing schemes, exclusive contracts, or launching their own services, and people started bailing out of legit streaming and back into piracy. If you dig into the average netflix user -- the viewing profile is a diet of new release movies, and tv shows which they serial watch. If they have kids... it's to babysit them with whatever's available the kid will watch.\n\n\nCase study: I have a friend who asked me what it would take to convert his entire dvd and blu ray collection (nearly a thousand titles) so he could watch it on his TV without having to deal with the mess of a physical library taking up all the walls in his basement -- and with small kids around, keeping it organized was becoming an unmanageable chore. He's not the first person to approach me -- this was a question asked quite a bit when I did repair work on residential/small business walk-ins. I had to tell him it wasn't legal any other way. It would have been easy enough to rip all the titles, buy some time on amazon cloud to encode it, and dump it on a half dozen drives with something like Plex -- not that expensive either. My friend would have happily spent the price of a new mid-range sedan on getting it working. *That's* the customer profile that keeps the industry afloat... and it never ceases to amaze me how much they screw with them. Unskippable ads? Encryption? Disks that decay in years (even perfectly preserved) to the point of unplayability? Giant warnings about penalties for piracy -- on *legitimate* purchases?\n\n\nWith as much pain and suffering as the distributors package up with the product, frankly I don't think even threatening years in an electric chair would change things much. And for media center software like this, it's even bad business -- they're doing it to satisfy a need that the market doesn't provide, and would happily pay through the nose for a legal solution, if it ever existed (which for a myriad of complicated reasons, won't). I've spent enough time fixing other people's computers to know the prevalence of piracy and the profile of a customer likely to be doing it... and it's actually damned rare to find people with drives stuffed with pirated material -- the overwhelming majority do it just so they can see the movie without spending a fortune on a ticket to go to the theatre -- or (and I've been told this) they just feel awkward going to a theatre by themselves. Usually all I find is a half dozen (fairly recent) movies they've grabbed, and sometimes a few seasons of their favorite TV show (which they can't watch on Netflix, or if they can, it's missing the last season or two). It's the same profile as the average Netflix user -- and in fact they probably would use Netflix if they could. What they won't do, is spend a hundred bucks a month subscribing to all these different Netflix clones to have access to the same material that used to be available through a single service, with a single subscription, that cost a tenth that. \n\n\nBottom line: The people who use Plex, Kodi, etc., are the people who are highly likely to have a large, physical collection of media and simply want the convenience of watching that collection without the attendant problems that a *physical* collection of media causes. There aren't many other customer profiles for these products... criminalizing them is cutting their noses off to spite their face. They're trying to kill off a highly profitable niche market out of an irrational fear that they're being ripped off... and that just doesn't make any business sense to me. If the industry would stop painting itself into a corner with copyright and tort law to lock down product consumption into very narrow use cases, it would probably make more money than it is now. If there is no product on the market near a competitive price point, or any price point for that matter, people are going to try and fill that void with their own solutions. Basically, that's what Plex and Kodi do -- they are products for a small, but very valuable, market. It's the difference between selling fishing boats and yachts. What I don't get, is why the industry only wants to sell fishing boats, and they're not only *not* trying to sell yachts, but instead trying to criminalize people who want them. You can sell a thousand fishing boats and make less money than on one yacht, and yet... here we are.
