[Link](https://tv.avclub.com/tommy-wiseau-ends-a-lengthy-chat-about-his-new-sitcom-b-1798275362) \n> But you can see very clearly the mainstream media, they don\u2019t see that. They prefer bullshit like Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s show, a redneck asshole, basically, I\u2019m sorry to say that, okay? Because they put Crystal Bell [Kristen Bell] on the program, and she advertised The Room and she\u2019s supposed to be a fan of The Room, this is ridiculous stuff! So for example Blu-ray. Nobody talk about Blu-ray. There\u2019s only one Blu-ray you have in the entire world. Even Sony, now I\u2019m working with them, so we\u2019ll see how we\u2019re doing. But it\u2019s, again, some of the biggest stars were supposed to support The Room, they\u2019re bashing The Room, at the same token, what did you do lately? Did you show your nice legs? She would say, \u201cOh, I\u2019m a businesswoman.\u201d What type of businesswoman you are? Are you telling me, when you\u2019re born, 6 years old, you knew about acting? How to behave yourself and the quirky smile and the squeaky voice, you think you own the world? I\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re not! You\u2019re not Elizabeth Taylor. You\u2019ll never be her. Because you don\u2019t have range. I\u2019m sorry, sweetie. Okay, and all the actresses are the same, they\u2019re making 20 million dollars, what did you do? I can create actors who give 20 million dollars with the best of the best. Give me media. So again, I speak out very openly so don\u2019t bullshit with me.
