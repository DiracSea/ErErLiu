If you take out the two ridiculous scenes of Rome being destroyed by lightning and the Golden Gate Bridge being destroyed by the Sun, it's a pretty decent movie. The dialogue is good, the soundtrack is good, there's no sub-romance plot, the film embraces its absurdities (\"unobtainium\"), and most of the main characters are given a background story. I don't understand the people who say the movie is not realistic. Neither is Star Wars or Lord Of The Rings.
