His only solo game there was a failure. Metal Gear, \"his\" claim to fame, was actually a project he inherited from a senior. \n\nNow you can defend what he did with the franchise and all subsequent titles all you want, but creating \"good\" work doesn't make him not an asshole. He would lie constantly about the budgets for his game and then when he expended all the funds Konami gave him would ask for more knowing he'd receive it due to sunk costs. The end result was that despite his titles popularity they barely turned a profit because he would spend enormous amounts of money on the weirdest shit. To boot he was incredibly stand-offish and confrontational with pretty much everyone in the company, including employees in his department and under him. He even outright refused to pay one of the English voice actors for the game. Konami finally had enough and let him go, which caused ignorant fanboys everywhere to lash out against the company. \n\nI remember when the outrage against Konami first happened I didn't understand, it being unfamiliar with both the company and Kojima, so I spent some time researching it. For a while I had a much better argument against him laid out with links and resources to verify everything I've said. I'll try and find it because boy do I hate that asshole and what a dick he is/was to the people who raised him up from nothing. \n\nHe does not deserve the praise and love he gets. \n\n**Edit**: From a previous post:\n\n[Here](https://youtu.be/l1Dtr6SuKB0?t=6307) a video where they talk about the issue a bit.

He had a difficult time finding a job before Konami hired him and he did a few games for them before he inherited the Metal Gear Solid title from another developer.\n\nIn the first link provided I believe it's one of the sound artist who talks about his ego being problematic for development and quite a few other people who have worked with him say similar things.
