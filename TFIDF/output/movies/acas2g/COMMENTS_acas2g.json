It had the most cohesive story, real emotional depth (with very little exposition, they *show* things rather than just tell the audience), a cast a characters that worked perfectly together, DOGS SO MANY DOGS, visually gorgeous without straining itself, the murders had just enough unreality to them without being the \"FUCKIT, WHO CARES ABOUT INTERNAL LOGIC, HERE'S A BONE MAN WHO THINKS HE'S A CAVE BEAR RUNNING AROUND\" type ridiculousness. Will Graham was a refreshing portrayal of the 'Tortured Genius' archetype, in that he was *actually* emotionally tortured by his unusual abilities, it took a visible mental and physical toll on him, he was a half-functional mess, he was male vulnerability played seriously, and not for laughs of hidden behind 20 layers of badass. Male vulnerability is not often shown on TV, not like this. Male characters like Will are not often leads (soft-spoken, vulnerable, nurturing, empathetic, mentally ill, desperate), and characters like that are not often shown to be capable of violence/killing when one needs to. He was soft, but still full of knives. That shit is my jam, right there. \n\nAnd they took that vulnerability, and made it the rising tension of the season. His deterioration was the major focal point, both the action and the emotion. \"Won't somebody help Will Graham?!\"  \n\nThey couldn't get the rights to Clarice Starling (an iconic female character), so they made sure (at least in the first season, hahahahahafuckitall) to utilize other female characters to the fullest extent, from a victimized little murder-fawn showing just how hard surviving is but keeps on moving forward, to a caring intellectual willing to yell at Jack Crawford to protect those she's supposed to protect, to Gillian goddamn Anderson being all Gillian Anderson all up in that shit. They tried to kill equal amounts of men and women, to not sexualize the corpses, shied away from most sex crimes because the showrunner didn't want to use rape as entertainment. \n\nIt showed mental illness in a startlingly realistic way, through multiple characters (I remember one minor character, the mother of a very mentally ill woman, saying that part of getting help for mental illness is to realize it's not always about getting sane, but managing expectations, and I mean goddamn that hit me hard). \n\nAnd again, most importantly, it had the most cohesive seasonal arc, it was a well constructed piece of art. There were definitely lovely moments in the following seasons, but damn, they just weren't as consistently good as the first season.
