Instead of one massive globe spanning conspiracy, just some shorter more down to earth stories.\n\nBond is on a bullet train in France from Rennes to Avignon to make an exchange of a flash drive from one of his cultivated contacts inside an organization, which is fairly routine.  But he gets word just before getting on the train that there might be another agent on the train.  Bond has to deduce who they are and investigate to find out what is happening so he can secure the flash drive and exit the train.  No giant fight scenes, just spy stuff.\n\nNext Bond is at a ski lodge and trying to set up covert surveillance equipment ahead of a secret meeting by bad people.  He has to contend with their security, but everyone involved wants to keep it hush hush, because Bond is a spy in a foreign friendly country and the other people are bad guys and wanted criminals.  Sneaking, word play, smarts and fighting ensue.\n\nThen we have Bond at a fancy dress party, trying to simultaneously court a woman as a new source of info (maybe she is trying to do the same to him unbeknownst to him) while also thwarting an assassination attempt.  Romance, seduction, intrigue, and a choreographed one-on-one athletic fight scene.\n\nFinally we bring it all together in the final story, where we learn that the information from the train led to Bond finding our about the meeting at the ski lodge and who would be there.  The surveillance at the lodge told him about the assassination plot at the fancy dress party, and the woman he turned into a source at the dress party plus some info from the assassin lets him neatly role up the bad guy organization in the final act using the full force of the agency and others.\n\nWe see a full operation from Bond from gathering the info, to acting on it and everything in between start to finish.  Sort of a day in the life of a spy kind of thing but over the course of a full year with changing seasons and whatnot, one season per story.

This rightly made the Galaxy Class concept look kind of dumb for investing so many design resources into being a mobile civilian city of science and education and diplomacy that had the capability to be safely tucked away behind a planet or something but was too impractical to be actually employed ninety percent of the time.\n\nRealistically, what would have made *ten times* more sense would have been to send two independently functional starships configured to fulfill different mission roles on most of the Enterprise D's missions- such as a dedicated science or diplomacy vessel and a heavily armed escort. As was implicitly demonstrated over the course of the show's run, if not explicitly acknowledged, the Galaxy Class was the Federation's [White Elephant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_elephant): an over-sized, over-capable, over-comfortable, over-complicated, over-costly, multiple-mutually-exclusive-role vessel riddled with design flaws that served to demonstrate the Federation's technological and economic superiority to foreign powers through what was effectively conspicuous consumption. The Enterprise D was propaganda, physically embodied, like [Teddy Roosevelt's Great White Fleet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_White_Fleet). \"Look at this ridiculously massive and powerful and luxurious and expensive starship we can afford to build and send all the way out to visit you just for a little talk! And it's not even a *war*ship! *So don't fuck with the Federation, because even our pacifistic diplomatic emissary can utterly wreck you.*\" The Federation was always much less utopian than it wanted to be, and that got expressed in strange ways sometimes, and the absurdity of their Galaxy Class starship is a prime example of that.", "created_utc": 1569287033.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1569330885.0, "id": "f1a7lvo", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_d89eb2", "parent_id": "t1_f19fztd", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/d89eb2/the_next_bond_movie_should_just_be_bond_being/f1a7lvo/", "score": 6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "strain_of_thought", "author_id": "gt7r0", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "\\*sigh\\* yeah.
