Don't get me wrong...I liked Real Steel. But as far as I'm concerned, the similarities between the Real Steel kid and Jake begin and end with \"both are fictional characters.\" And unless I saw it wrong, it looks like Jake travels to Roland's world through some kind of deus ex machina portal? The filmmakers sure flinched away from the book on that one.\n\nWhen I picture the Man in Black I see of an [enigmatic and ruthless villain](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/51b3dc8ee4b051b96ceb10de/t/577699221b631bfd4d674053/1467390251053/), not a [spectacular douchebag](http://tomandlorenzo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Matthew-McConaughey-Idris-Elba-The-Dark-Tower-Movie-Set-Tom-Lorenzo-Site-5-1.jpg).\n \nThe Underworld-esque gunfighting really bugs me, particularly considering how many bullets are getting thrown around. In the book, when Roland **briefly** visits our world, the idea that he could just *buy* a box of *fifty* bullet practically blew his mind! To him, bullets were impossibly rare - using one wasn't a decision to be taken lightly.\n\nI could go on, but the other comments are probably just as good (if not better) at lampooning this trailer than me.\n\n(/rant)", "created_utc": 1493837611.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dh35b8k", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_68yuh5", "parent_id": "t3_68yuh5", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/68yuh5/the_dark_tower_official_trailer_hd/dh35b8k/", "score": 16, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "iamcave76", "author_id": "j2btx", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "[overlook hotel](https://imgur.com/xkrMoF2)\n\n\n[Pennywise sign](https://imgur.com/rSLCkGR)", "created_utc": 1493806818.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dh2hzuo", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_68yuh5", "parent_id": "t3_68yuh5", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/68yuh5/the_dark_tower_official_trailer_hd/dh2hzuo/", "score": 52, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "alphatangolima", "author_id": "jxepx", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "[deleted]", "created_utc": 1493806127.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dh2hrfr", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_68yuh5", "parent_id": "t3_68yuh5", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/68yuh5/the_dark_tower_official_trailer_hd/dh2hrfr/", "score": 81, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Oh man, this just plain looks bad.

The problem is that we have more than enough generic science fiction and young adult fiction garbage to keep us occupied for the next 300 years. The books offer the following themes which would resonate well with modern adult audiences, but by all appearances have been ignored by the movie.\n\n1. Obsession. Roland is obsessed with the dark tower, it is his only purpose for existing. King intentionally draws a parallel between Eddie, a heroin addict, and Roland's obsession with reaching and saving the tower. Roland's entire character arc is his transformation from a man filled with Ahab-like singular purpose to one who realizes the importance of other things but is powerless to change the trajectory of his fate. He doesn't need a scrappy preteen to tell him to save the tower.\n\n2. Interconnection. The universe of the dark tower is not just connected by a few passing references to other works by King. The meta-textual references in the books are a means of illustrating that every aspect of one reality effects every other aspect of every other reality. In other words, everything is connected to everything else with all points converging at the tower itself. This is where the sense of urgency and stakes come from. The tower is not your typical marvel extended universe mcguffin, it carries thematic weight.\n\n3. Duality. Carrying forward from the other theme there is a dual nature to virtually everything in the Dark Tower. The man in black isn't the evil opposite of Roland, he is Roland with a different obsession. The tower is a giant looming black edifice in the middle of a barren wasteland, but it's also an unimaginably beautiful rose growing in an empty lot in NYC. Virtually everything in King's original work has a counterpart, or a twinner if ya ken. No one and nothing is as simple as unipolar as being \"worse than the devil\". \n\nFor anyone who thinks that the hate being poured on this trailer is because they made Roland black you either need to pull your head out of your ass or find a different angle from which to shill. People are getting pissed off because the trailer does not appear to honor the source material except in the most superficial ways.
