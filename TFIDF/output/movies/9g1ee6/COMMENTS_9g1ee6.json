Arbuckle's ex-wife, Minta Durfee, for example, would go on to live a long life and would utterly demean Rappe, claiming all sorts of nonsense along the lines of execs having to fumigate chairs after Virginia sat in them. \n\nThere is no actual medical evidence Rappe suffered from any venereal disease, or that she had an abortion (which, at various times, has been put forward as a cause of death for her, in spite of the very clear findings of the autopsy that show nothing about venereal disease or botched abortions). Nor, for that matter, was Virginia drunk as is sometimes asserted.\n\nThe best book about the Arbuckle-Rappe case is \"Room 1219: The Life of Fatty Arbuckle, the Mysterious Death of Virginia Rappe, and the Scandal that Changed Hollywood\" by Greg Merritt. Merritt disentangles a lot of the mythology around Rappe's death, using primary sources such as her autopsy. The story has been so muddled by Arbuckle's defenders and detractors (and just generally sloppy, salacious Hollywood 'histories') that it's hard to get to the bottom of it - only he knew what really went on behind those closed doors. But Merritt puts together a good case for a consensual sexual encounter that went wrong due to Rappe's underlying cystitis, and the subsequent shitstorm as a result of both the defense and prosecutorial side attacking Arbuckle and Rappe in turn. Rappe never actually accused Arbuckle of rape in the time it took her to die a prolonged and excruciating death - her words in the immediate aftermath of what happened - \"he did it, I know he did it. I have been hurt, I am dying\" - could easily be the words of a woman in agony due to her ruptured bladder as the result of what was a consensual encounter.\n\nArbuckle lost his career, Rappe lost her life, and both had their reputations destroyed. \n", "created_utc": 1537062885.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e61wyqu", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_9g1ee6", "parent_id": "t1_e61cq5b", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/9g1ee6/roscoe_arbuckles_the_cook_was_released_100_years/e61wyqu/", "score": 23, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Wobbegongcocktail", "author_id": "kzmkt", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Whatever happened to Delmont after all of that?\n\nPlease tell me she got her just deserts.", "created_utc": 1537047084.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e61i80r", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_9g1ee6", "parent_id": "t1_e61cq5b", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/9g1ee6/roscoe_arbuckles_the_cook_was_released_100_years/e61i80r/", "score": 11, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "NewtonGimmick", "author_id": "i4pwp", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "The alleged rape victim\u2019s name was Rappe?", "created_utc": 1537053828.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e61oojt", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_9g1ee6", "parent_id": "t1_e61cq5b", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/9g1ee6/roscoe_arbuckles_the_cook_was_released_100_years/e61oojt/", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "programmermama", "author_id": "83krh3n", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Thank you", "created_utc": 1537048090.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e61j7h9", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_9g1ee6", "parent_id": "t1_e61fghj", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/9g1ee6/roscoe_arbuckles_the_cook_was_released_100_years/e61j7h9/", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "bostonthinka", "author_id": "bpuw2", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Ragtime is on the Retroplex channel in 24 mins.\n\nWryly?", "created_utc": 1537076501.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e627tsn", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_9g1ee6", "parent_id": "t1_e61ukl4", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/9g1ee6/roscoe_arbuckles_the_cook_was_released_100_years/e627tsn/", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "bostonthinka", "author_id": "bpuw2", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "\"Crime of the century\" in 1906...

It resulted in censorship that severely limited what creative types could get away with, and made a lot of films pretty vanilla, but I think it's good to remember that it wasn't wholly without cause, and also, there was a depression going on, and that had to have an influence on what was deemed culturally responsible. \n\nI think one of the issues I take is this idea that audiences back then were more puritanical than they are today, and I'm not so certain that's true anymore, or if it is true, it's degrees of separation than it is nonexistent. Certainly you can get away with things today that would have been pornographic back then, but there is political and social influence on film today that I think correlates well with 1930s self-censorship. There are certain topics today that mainstream Hollywood shies well away from so that they don't rock the boat, and look at the number of scandals that are completely reshaping careers, and films themselves.
