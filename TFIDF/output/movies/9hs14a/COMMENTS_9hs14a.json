I get the impression that their universe is *years* in the making and was built up very carefully and slowly. So many different styles of superhero films that were all mostly independent, but had subtle things tying them together at first. Like, when Captain America first came out, I had no idea that the tesseract was gonna be an infinity gem. And many of those films had unique styles, very much designed to function well on their own. Eg, the likes of technical and dramatic Iron Man is very different from the more fantasy based Doctor Strange and again from the very sci fi and comedy focused Guardians of the Galaxy.\n\nAny there was so many movies before they were combined into the Avengers, then so many more in between Avenger films to further build up each one's character. Yet, most of the films were really strong on their own and all the titular heroes are well fleshed out (I feel like the not-fleshed out ones like Hawkeye are easy to ignore, anyway).\n\nIf anything, all I'm kinda disappointed with is how the Netflix TV shows (Daredevil, etc) feel rather disconnected from the MCU. There's the odd name dropping of a movie hero (half the time being a weird indirect reference where they don't use the hero's actual name) or of \"the incident\", but beyond that, all the Netflix characters are in their own little world. Somehow the likes of Spidey never notice the Netflix heroes even when buildings are being blown up or the whole city has an earthquake.

Hamill deserves to get to play him on screen. \n\nI guess if Hamill deserves it, so does Conroy. But the difference is Conroy isn't a prolific screen actor. Even though he would be fine. You need names to sell it. Hamill is a big enough name.\n\nSo what if we retcon the Burton films, but give Keaton the Batman role? And just pretend Hamill was The Joker all along and he didn't die in Batman 89? Then you can go all out by getting a big box office draw to play Terry. I'd be all in on this, except I wouldn't want Burton to come back as director. His best work is in the past. And I have a sneaking suspicion he would find a way to cram Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter in there, and that would kill any credence the film would have for me. Also, Burton's Gotham would look so stupid on screen in 2018. It's something about modern filmmaking techniques. City sets in studios are so obvious now. Look at the Justice League reshoots. God that scene SUCKED. Hell, even The Narrows in Batman Begins is quite obvious.

I actually respect what they tried to do with the Joker there. He represented a different kind of crazy, and I think it had real potential. I think it would have been better if you only saw him in flashbacks, though, with him being a lingering threat in the shadows.\n\nMy primary issue with Leto's Joker is that it reduced Joker to a run-of-the-mill kind of crazy. Joker is not a psychopath. Psychopathy is, likely, one part of his composition, but there's a lot more. In fact, it's one of his defining features that his criminal behavior defies conventional and well-understood archetypes.\n\nI don't blame Leto for this. I think with a different script and different character concepts, he has the acting chops to portray Joker extremely well, and be regarded highly even in company such as Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger.\n\nIt's just poorly thought out. Joker had no reason to be prominent in it, and should have been just sparingly shown solely in the context of Harley's character development, growing to understand how she's in an abusive relationship where her sole value to Joker is being used as a tool to antagonize Batman. They made the mistake of trying to flesh out too much of Joker instead, and used unnecessary fillers that don't really fit.\n\nThis is also one of my big concerns with this upcoming Joker movie. Joker, as a character, is meant to be understood in the context of his relationship to Batman. He doesn't really have an origin story. He frequently makes shit up about his past as an unreliable narrator, and that's a canon feature of the character. There is a recent Three Jokers story that is starting to explore this in interesting ways, under the idea that there have actually been three distinct individuals under the Joker persona in Batman's past. To do a Joker movie that is set at a time long before Bruce Wayne became Batman doesn't seem like it can capture what needs to be captured. I'd love to be proven wrong, and obviously I have full faith in Joaquin Phoenix to do a great acting job, but I just worry that the material he's given to act may be bad in and of itself.", "created_utc": 1537562023.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e6efi4l", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_9hs14a", "parent_id": "t1_e6e84k0", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/9hs14a/first_look_at_joaquin_phoenix_in_makeup_from_joker/e6efi4l/", "score": 20, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "bleed_air_blimp", "author_id": "11vd2v", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Relatively young?
