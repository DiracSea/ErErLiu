(I assume this will happen; Lionsgate bought Starz recently so it makes sense they will move their content from EPIX to Starz , if they haven't already)\n- Sony Pictures, 20th Century Fox --> not 100% sure on these, I THINK they either do one-off auctions for each title, or maybe they sell small bundles of films every so often; to me knowledge they don't have long-term deals with premium services, although someone please chime in if i am wrong\n\nYou also asked WHEN movies tend to go to streaming services... this is always in flux. The trend over the last 5-10 years is that the time between theater and premium service is shrinking, somewhat (largely?) due to piracy concerns cannabilizing downstream revenues. Nowadays, I think we see movies enter the premium service window ~3-6 months after they LEAVE theaters. Again someone chime in if that's wrong.
