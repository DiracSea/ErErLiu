I very rarely comment on posts, but I just want to share how big of a part of my life Jackie has been for me. \n\nI consider him the 3rd most influential person in my life, behind my 2 parents. Growing up, I would watch one of his movies every weekend with my mom and dad which were my only early memories of them. We were poor and my dad was an immigrant that worked in the fields (farms) to make money for our family. My mom had to work as well and they would leave before I woke up and got home after I fell asleep (my mom would see me more often, but not my dad). I would find comfort watching his movies because it would remind me of being with my family. I would watch them over and over again and started to shape my morals around the characters he would play. In many cases, some punk kid who has to gain or earn the value of morality. How he would always (mostly) protect the weak and people he loved. And I saw that with the passion my parents showed working hard for our family. I learned that I have to earn everything that in want in life. So many stories of how much it sucked to work with Jackie because how long he would keep the crew there to redo shots over and over and over again until it was perfect in his mind. The passion he puts into every scene he shoots and stunt he performs is so awe inspiring to me. And that's what I try to model my life around. \n\nThen, learning about his personal life and his *somewhat similar background drew me even closer to him as a person. I work hard and try to appreciate everything I get in life and I want to thank so much of that mindset to Jackie Chan. And I know he's not perfect (supposed scandals and various tabloid headlines), but that's what makes me like him even more. Because as good of a person as I try to be, I'm not perfect. But I try because I grew up seeing his characters come from bad places or in bad mindsets and evolve. Not into a perfect person, but someone who learns from his mistakes and tries to move on in order to improve himself. \n\nAgain, I know this is just a comment but I just wanted to express how thrilled this news makes me. He's been so influential to my life and will continue to be. I love every time I hear him get another award because he truly deserves it.
