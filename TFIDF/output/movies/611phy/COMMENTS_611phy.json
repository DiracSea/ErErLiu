Their homeworld is referred to as Paradise.\n\nRidley Scott initially had the title of this next movie titled Alien: Paradise Lost.  \n\nFrom the trailer of Alien Covenant we find that the planet they reach is perfect for humans to live on, you could even call it a paradise. This confirms to me that Shaw is or was on the planet that Covenant is headed to. \n\nSo on the time line when Covenant reaches Paradise about 10 years has passed. So Shaw has likely been on this world a very long time.  \n\nWe don't know if the Engineers were wiped out before she arrived or not but it's clear from the trailer that the planet is completely barren but there are traditional Alien style eggs there.  \n\nWe learned from previous Alien films that the xenomorphs take on qualities of their hosts. This is also demonstrated in Prometheus with the black goo itself when it is introduced to Holloway. The transformation was very slow but affecting him on a cellular level still. When he had sex with Shaw he passed mutated sperm on to her. Now the SUPER COOL thing about sperm being mutated is it made a creature that gained the ability to reproduce specifically through the MALE form of penetration/impregnation. Note the creature she had C sectioned out looked like a large white sperm with multiple tails. This creature then in turn used it's ability of impregnation on the Engineer.  \n\nOKAY BUT CHECK THIS SHIT OUT- that creature was one sperm out of what, millions? A lot of mutated genetic material was passed on to Shaw. She could have been slowly, slowly undergoing changes on a cellular level that we wouldn't have seen yet by the time Prometheus came to an end.  \n\nNow a Queen also has the ability to reproduce, specifically through FEMALE form of producing eggs. This is a trait that would be evolved through interaction with a female host. But then why don't all xenomorphs born from female hosts become Queens?   \n\nCall me crazy but I think Shaw either gave birth to or became a proto Queen        ", "created_utc": 1490293889.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1490296126.0, "id": "dfbf5za", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_611phy", "parent_id": "t1_dfbd6i2", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/611phy/alien_covenant_new_poster/dfbf5za/", "score": 623, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Ehrre", "author_id": "exhfm", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Just btw, it's alluding.

Knowing that, if left to their own devices - they'd build a hive unit similar to Earth insects does not answer the question of how heavily they've been modified since then, how many times, and by how many different species.\n\nPersonally, I think it'd be pretty horrifying to have a violent species of predatory semi-insects spread across the galaxy, not simply because they are effective at breeding and expanding, but because other species select them as a useful weapon when directed at enemies. Every time an intelligent species encounters them, they capture a few and modify them to be even more effective at their chosen form of mass murder, each time leaving their mark, and likely being devoured by the product of their own insidious engineering. A tool of death that outlives its toolmakers, acting as a living monument to the intelligence, technology, and cruelty of the galaxy's inhabitants.\n\nThen, you have a good combination of both terror - from the xenomorphs themselves - and horror - from the fact that Weyland-Yutani is actively, *persistently*, looking for a way to weaponize the xenomorphs.\n\nThe idea of humans being not simply complicit, but eager and willing, to participate in the \"refinement\" to this galactic monument to the cruelty and depravity of intelligent life, would be a nice addition to the theme, in a way that allows it to be reinforced by new revelations about xenomorph abilities & \"lifestyle,\" as well as allowing for different xenomorph \"cultivars\" to exist in different areas of the galaxy, that have been modified to have wildly different abilities.\n\nEdit: forgot to address the 'insect' point. Insects are some of the most ancient forms of life, most alien (to humans), and are still wildly effective.

Most drastically, the Xenomorphs in his script now exhibit an ability to reproduce via a close-proximity airborne contagion, similar to a virus. When the Xenomorph contagion is inhaled into the lungs, the victim, after a variable amount of time, goes through \"the change\", as Gibson calls it, and becomes a form of Xenomorph. The transformation process imagined by Gibson can be summarized as a rapid and involuntary change in the human's skeletal and muscular makeup below the skin, concluding with the newly formed Xenomorph graphically tearing the flesh husk off of its body.\n>The airborne contagion concept was intended to introduce suspense, as the survivors would not know if anyone among them was infected until the change suddenly occurs. The concept and the process of sudden transformation both bear clear parallels to John Carpenter's iconic 1982 horror film The Thing, which revolves around an alien lifeform that can disguise itself as humans in order to hide amongst a group of people stranded in an Antarctic science station, and which gruesomely emerges when discovered. Perhaps more notably, a similar means of airborne procreation would reappear in the Alien franchise 30 years later, in Alien: Covenant, in which the Neomorph creatures exhibit a similar means of reproducing via airborne spores.\n\nI like how Scott seems to just casually use the ideas that other writers provided him with in their rejected scripts, lol.", "created_utc": 1490294439.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dfbfnsr", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_611phy", "parent_id": "t1_dfbf7ck", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/611phy/alien_covenant_new_poster/dfbfnsr/", "score": 32, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "SwedishFishSticks", "author_id": "cky08", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I went to San Diego Comic-Con a few years ago and Sideshow was giving away $50 discount things.
