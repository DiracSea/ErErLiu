Our aim was to make it so good I might be able to have some songs done live in the film. one day I freaked Paul out so much he went outside and refused to work. he was red hot and wouldn't look at me. eventually when he calmed down enough he said, \"I don't know who told you that story because I was the only one there...\" It turned out the song Paul had put up I hated and didn't want to record it, or at least not that day, and apparently what i said was so exactly what Jim had said to Paul when they were supposed to record it that he freaked out. It was too much for him. spooky. I tried to explain i wasnt acting its just how I felt about the song. so i went for a walk giving Paul a chance to regroup. when I came back i though of something to keep Paul animated and working and I rushed into the booth and said, \n\"PUT UP THE END...\"\nHe quietly told me no, because I couldn't sing the end. we got in a a mild fight and eventually he said he didn't want me to get down about recording or my singing but he finally offered his trump card, \n\"\"Val, you can't record it. No one can. Jim couldn't even do it. He only recorded it once and thats whats on the record...\"\n\"Put up THE END... It's all right.\"\nSo he did. \nAnd I nailed it.\nAnd Paul was weeping almost immediately so i had to look away but he added that extra emotion to my performance. I messed up in 2 places... \nWhen Paul could finally talk he whispered, \"Val, I sweat to God, Jim blew 2 parts and we had to drop in to fix them. They are the same places in the song...\" \nPeople have often spoken in a different kind of language about this particular performance, which i've always thought was because of Jim's mythic interests and Oliver's feeding that angle in the press.

That when you do your job, and really commit, and you are Lady Ophelia, you can really smell those flowers, and you really have memories of floating around that stage, right out of your mind...

He's a baritone tenor. So is Elvis. Thats about it for rock and roll singers. But I sing every song live in that film.

We lost our first director after a month of shooting and i watched Kurt sacrifice his own role and energy to devote himself as a storyteller, even going so far as to draw up shot lists to help our replacement director who passed on, George Cosmotos, who came in with only 2 days prep. That's probably how its become a story that Kurt directed it. I was there every minute and altho Kurts version differs slightly from mine, the one thing he's totally correct about is, how hard he worked the day before, for the next days shot list, and tremendous effort he and I both put into editing, as the studio wouldn't give us any extra time to make up for the whole month we lost with the first director. I was very clear and outspoken about what I wanted to do with my role, and actors like Powers Boothe, who we just lost, and Bill Paxton, were always 100% supportive, even in the blistering heat and sometimes as the day would fade, at the possible expense of their own screen time. Kurt did this for the film virtually every hour. I would even go up to him and whisper, \"Go for another...\" meaning another take when I thought he could go further, but in the interest of the schedule, he would pound on. Very Wyatt-like come to think of it. Elliot used to drive all the way out to hell and gone just to watch some of our scenes. So many lead actors took small roles just to rock a great western script. Its not often you get to dust the likes of Clint Eastwood at the box-office. He had a film out when we opened and it just couldn't keep up. Then Kevin Cosner had all the dough and distribution money and stars and couldn't make a dent in our popularity. Altho I liked Dennis Quaid and my first girlfriend is also in it which was super weird, Mare Winingham. Back to Powers for a moment, such a gracious actor and if you love acting go back and check out his early emmy winning roles, he's the real deal. And Bill Paxton, like a cheerleader for all film, for all Creativity. Always happy like it was his first job. He would have been happy if you lit him on fire and hung him upside down, as long as there was a camera running. Just like a perfect thespian. ALL THE WAY. SUPPORTIVE. Sweet. We all miss them both.

All this metal and danger was simply poetry in his mind, some completely unique, beautiful symmetry to him. \n\nAnd he was also a greatly underrated actors director, because of his vivid photography prowess. Many many top class performances from Tony. And personally, he was the kindest most simpatico director you could ever hope to work for. He always knew what he wanted but if you wanted to go the complete opposite way he would find a way to embrace it. He also loved to film when actors didn't know he was shooting. Oliver Stone picked that up as well.

It's you! Thank you so much for the recognition. I've always been drawn to iconic images and characters. Partly my fathers talent for Twain-like story telling, and tall tales, also my larger than life grandfather who was a gold miner and prospector very similar to the character in TREASURE OF SIERRA MADRE, the Walter Houston character. And Im sure it made a larger impression than first realized we lived across the way from Roy Rogers out in Chatsworth. Our best friends dad was a mounted policeman who walked around the market with a 6 gun, even when not in uniform. That was normal out there. So gold, I've covered a few things in gold. I used to pan for gold like the old desert rats did. Like my father did. we found it to. In Arizona, in New Mexico. In high mountain streams in California. And covering my first Apple Macinitosh, just seemed the way to honor what is already a distant memory, yet very recent. The day the world changed. My children have no knowledge of knowledge being something one has to search for. When I moved to New York in '77 I think, or '78, you had to go to 1 of 2 record stores, downtown, who had john Lee Hooker records. And not all of them, not even maybe one new one, you had to ask around. Find someone into him. Write a letter. send away for your record. Wait. Dream. All gone now. I think the Macintosh will be extremely valuable in about 5 minutes. I have a modest collection as I hope to make more pieces out of them to honor the changing of how we interact. It is \"My first golden apple.\" And now it is yours. I hope you come to the Woodwards gallery while my first show is up. or come out to La for my second show at GABBA GALLERY third week in July. Also doing a collaboration with David Choe who's got a massive show on Wilshire also in July. Check my web as well valkilmer.com for listings of my live tour. Perhaps I'm coming to a town near you!

I was an extra on DOORS when i was a senior in high school.  It was a deleted scene at this supposed UCLA bar called Turkey Joint and Jim comes away from the bar to jump onstage with the band (I always assumed it was supposed to be his first moment onstage with the band)  Val as Jim would leap onto this 20 foot long bar table that led to the stage, wheeling as if on a wire toward the stage while spraying his beer...on me, mostly.  Take after take.  They'd come in and kind of wipe me down a little bit...and then here it comes again. Finally after 3-4 times Val (in character) walks past me between takes and stops to say, \"Hey man, I'm sorry about all the beer y'know...(trails off unintelligibly)\" to which I replied, \"Aw, it's ok Jim, great show!\"  He starts to disengage, and then sort of reassesses me out of the corner of his eye while slinking away...and bam! He spins back around and stops very close to my face and says, in an oddly impartial manner, \"You know what...I really don't care at all.\"  \nIt was pretty awesome...I was a very intense 17 year old with a serious interest in all things Jimbo and I felt like I was able to meet him in a way.  I also think that in that small crowd of extras I probably stood out as the Morrison wannabe kid and have always thought Val might have subconsciously recognized that and singled my poseur ass out for a little abuse and titillation...as Jim was wont to do.\nI got into so much trouble at home for that extra work. I didn't tell my parents and had ditched school to participate.  My dumb ass thought I'd just scoot in and shoot the scene and be home for dinner.  We didn't break until about 2am.  This was pre cell phone.  But honestly, it was so worth it.  I think the Oscars were the very next day, if I remember correctly, because I believe Oliver Stone was nominated for Born On The 4th Of July.

I did not see that much as my unit was generally on the offensive. When we got in to a firefight, you never knew how long it would last, and the last thing you want is to drop your magazines over a kilometer of desert and then be left with one in your rifle and no way to reload. \n\n To speed things up while going door to door I picked up a RAMP, and loved it, so I picked up two more. Found the most I could realistically fit was 2 so I gave one to my buddy. Next thing you know everyone was getting them.\n\n Reloading out of ammo pouches, we keep our full magazines upside down, so you could feel with out looking which had ammo and which did not. I used to tape a small section of 550 cord in a U shape along the bottom of the magazine, so I could just pull on that to get it out faster. Now there are \"Ranger Base\" that has the loop built in to it (popular on magpul, and now you can find them for other mag types).  Should a firefight get prolonged in one area, or in a movement to contact we sweep and area and find we have to stay longer, more ammo will be brought in and we load exhausted magazines.\n\n In the movie, they were moving out from a robbery, it was fight and exfil or die trying.

The picture is leaps and bounds above the DVD. The film may not have been remastered, but it's a stable, vibrant unmistakably HD presentation. In the declining physical media market, collectors should be thankful for bouquet labels like Choice Collection that is rolling out niche films like Neighbors (1981), Stripes (theatrical), and Real Genius. There is simply no way otherwise that you could have official Blu-rays of these movies on your shelves. The arwork resembles anything you'd see in retail. The disc itself is white with a big barcode -- so what? It has the movie title in stylized font. Judging by the reviews I'm reading, you'd think the disc arrived in a paper sleeve with REAL GENIUS written across it in Sharpie; not even close. I'll continue to support the Choice Collection and I'm excited to see what's next.

Nothing, actually. I don't remember why. But our Drill Sergeant decided to let us watch a movie, and eat some pizza, no strings attached. Just 'cause. \n\nThe Ghost and the Darkness was what got chosen, because some of us liked it, and our Drill Sergeant was a huge fan, and his vote was what really mattered anyway.  ;) \n\nThat night, for the first time since I'd left everything I knew and loved, I got to feel like I was part of a family again. I know, silly, but you have to understand, hell you probably do understand what it's like that first time you leave everything you know behind. Our drill sergeant brought out a big overstuffed ancient arm chair from his office, plopped it down in the middle of the room, pulled out the TV on wheels and fired up that movie. We killed the lights and 60 'boys' training to be killers huddled around 'dad' and watched your movie in rapt attention, while munching pizza. \n\nTo this day, watching it is like coming 'home'. \n\nAlso, it's awesome, and one of my favorites you've done, for more reasons than just nostalgia. \n\nThanks for making it. I can honestly say that it enriched my life. And helped me tough it out through Infantry Basic in the months right after 9/11. \n\nHonestly, thanks.

People that know I am a Christian Scientist make the assumption that I have somehow endangered myself. But many many people have been healed by prayer throughout recorded history. And many many people have died by whatever was modern medicine. I had the honor of knowing Dr. Bernard Lown for example, a man who's invention of the refribulator,(SP) never spell it right. The machine with the paddles that zaps people back into the world of the living... Probably responsible for bringing more people back from death than anyone in the 20th century, and I asked him what was the most important thing for a doctor to do when a patient fears for their life. He started to weep without his voice wavering and he leaned into me and said, \"Fluff their pillow. That what I tell all the interns. LOVE. Love heals. More than any other skills, I urge them to LOVE the life they are entrusted to save.\" Well thats what is at the heart of Mrs. Eddy's understanding of the teachings of Jesus. He taught his students how to heal physical and mental challenges by understanding the immense power of love. I have seen people turn down love. I have turned it down myself when I was younger. I still had hearings thru relying solely on prayer, and came in went from a very challenging faith. And sometimes had hearings when I didn't believe. It didn't matter in Jesus' day whether the patient believed. It doesn't matter today. Love doesn't care about our tiny human thoughts. Thats how I understand it anyway. I've probably tried to convince people when I was younger. I try to mind my own business now that I'm older. I also hope I never turn down Love again. It was an unspeakable sense of universal support while I was briefly in the hospital. Even 2 of my doctors mentioned praying with me, for me. Sometimes people are surprisingly mean about this sort of talk. Maybe they mix it up in their minds with extremists. People screaming with signs in front of Planned Parenthood or something. Thats not my sense of Christianity. Or most peoples regardless of their religion. Any more than a Muslim identified themselves with the madness of a suicide bomber spreading fear in the name of Allah...", "created_utc": 1494981450.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dhnk1y3", "is_submitter": true, "link_id": "t3_6bkcl7", "parent_id": "t1_dhncx88", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6bkcl7/hello_reddit_i_am_actor_and_artist_val_kilmer_i/dhnk1y3/", "score": 2137, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "OfficialValKilmer", "author_id": "178a2i", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "cool", "created_utc": 1494980381.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dhnj6x8", "is_submitter": true, "link_id": "t3_6bkcl7", "parent_id": "t1_dhnchak", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6bkcl7/hello_reddit_i_am_actor_and_artist_val_kilmer_i/dhnj6x8/", "score": 409, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "OfficialValKilmer", "author_id": "178a2i", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Theres no accounting for taste...", "created_utc": 1494980399.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dhnj7f2", "is_submitter": true, "link_id": "t3_6bkcl7", "parent_id": "t1_dhndwm4", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6bkcl7/hello_reddit_i_am_actor_and_artist_val_kilmer_i/dhnj7f2/", "score": 551, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "OfficialValKilmer", "author_id": "178a2i", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Thank you for putting so much work into a reddit ama.
