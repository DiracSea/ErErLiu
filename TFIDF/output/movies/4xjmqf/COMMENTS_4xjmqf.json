Phantom Menace would be here soon. I was driving a Hummer Limo. Kenny, his wife, Jeremy Bulloch (Boba Fett), and David Prowse (Darth Vader) book our limo for a couple of days while they're in town for whatever comic-con. \n\nI was pretty excited to be picking up some OG Star Wars actors, even if all of them were concealed behind masks at all times. I pick up some champagne and OJ, so they can make some mimosas (\"Bucks Fizz\" they told me is what the brits call it) on the way to and from the con. \n\nSo, the hummer limo is a pretty big, tall vehicle. Kenny Baker is not tall. When you open the passenger door, a little step ladder appears. This was still too tall for Kenny and his wife. \n\nKenny is like, \"You gotta lift me.\"\n\nI'm thinking... O...K... \n\nSo, he turns toward the Hummer, his back to me, and I go to grab him by the waist to lift him up. \n\n\"No\", he says. \"By the elbows\" and he puts his hands straight out with his elbows by his side. \n\nSo now I'm proceeding like a fork-lift operator, docking my hands palms up to meet his elbows and start to lift him. \n\nFun fact: Little people have the same amount of guts and entrails as normal people, largely leading to a lot of the medical complications they have. Point is, Kenny Baker was deceptively heavy and I almost dropped the fucker. \n\nI had to do the same thing with his wife. \n\nAll the time, their good friend and WAY TALLER AND STRONGER THAN ME David Prowse is just standing there watching me with a smirk on his face. \n\nOver the course of two days I think I lifted Kenny and his wife 5-6 times each. Unlimited champagne, at my expense. \n\nThis experience also taught me Brits don't tip. \n\nRIP you heavy little bastard.

I bought tickets as soon as I could and took her to the midnight premiere. She loved the movie and as a lot of us she gasped and cry a couple of times through out the film. But that little aww that left her mouth when Arthur shows up was so bitter sweet, I think she saw him all beat up and kinda of tired like R2 had lived many battles and it was not worth keep going anymore. And I think she relates to that. We have been through a couple of rough times the last couple of years and it has really taken a toll on my mum. \n\nAnd seeing her favorite character a witty little robot, all tired and beat up was pretty much her and what the little girl had become. \n\nSometimes you can see my mum getting sad when talking about Star Wars, because it reminds her of my grandparents. My grandpa passed away when I was a baby and my grandma passed away a couple of years ago and its been very hard on her. \n\n\nHow the Hell am I gonna tell her the man behind(inside) her favorite character has passed away?  I know she is a grown up but when it comes to Star Wars it's like she is ten all over again. \n\n\n\nRight now that I write this I notice that there is a good chance my mum doesn't relate to R2 herself but I do.

There can be a lot of medical issues to go along with the different types of dwarfism, some pretty life threatening or life expectancy lowering. Medicine has improved so much since then, but wasn't uncommon for this to be an issue. Even then, some of the \"treatments\" did more harm than good, but it was a really different time back then. Even in the 90s, some stuff was done that was not always helpful. That scene in Gattaca where the lead character had his legs cut open and bones elongated by making them grow longer was a procedure originally created to help add height to little people. I'm not sure if they still do it, last I heard, it was done for extreme situations.\n\nMany were shunned in communities, and few could expect decent outcomes (this was before laws against firing/not hiring people due to health issues) later in life. \n\nFor many, their best \"job\" potential was going into a side show or circus where they could be accepted internally, but it was at the cost of not being accepted by society at large. That's why there's a lot of emotional baggage that goes along with little people who take jobs in the entertainment industry. It's often that they're being hired to be a little person (usually comic relief), and not because they can do the job despite being one. \n\nIt's a lot better now, but it's a hard scar to overcome. Even the most famous and successful ones have talked about it in the past- where they came from personally and how they got to where they are now. Dinklage said that he felt a lot of reservations about GoT, because he was afraid it would be another jester type role (little people jester roles were a weird not quite fad for a few years. It was pretty ugh for little people at that time) as those were basically it for little people in fantasy roles, and they were pretty terrible.\n\n\n", "created_utc": 1471108168.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d6g1oud", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_4xjmqf", "parent_id": "t1_d6g0kc0", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/4xjmqf/kenny_baker_actor_behind_r2d2_dies_film/d6g1oud/", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Vio_", "author_id": "brxfa", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I like to think that Kenny's not dead\u2014he just got a job working for the Supreme Being.
