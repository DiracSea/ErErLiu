Not really. It doesn't actually give Cage control over the power. Rather, it essentially just turns Cage into an Alpha in the eyes of the Omega. The Omega resets time whenever it detects an Alpha being killed. Cage's deaths trigger the same response, causing the Omega to reset time whenever he dies.\n\nIt helps to think of the Omega not as a fully-functional, thinking brain, but more as a regulatory organ; storing and retrieving information, and reacting to certain stimulus. Alphas don't actually remember the events of the previous loop themselves, but rather the Omega senses their deaths, resets time and then restores their intervening memory to them so that they can adjust their tactics to survive what had previously bested them. As far as the Omega is concerned, Cage is now an Alpha, and it treats him the same way.\n2) Why is the Omega not restored to life by the final time reset, and instead dies 24 hours before Cage and J Squad actually kill it in Paris?\n\nThis ties in with question #1. If you accept the notion that the Omega is actually the only being with true knowledge of the reset, it follows that in order for it's own memory not to be erased with the reset, the Omega must exist outside of time in some form. It resets everything else, but the Omega itself persists as something of an anchor. Think of it this way: The Omega isn't actually reseting everything in the universe. The Omega itself is actually traveling back in time, and only the Omega.\n\nWhen Cage is \"infected\" by the Omega's dying blood in Paris and then dies himself, he triggers one final reset or time jump. But the Omega is still dying. Time \"resets\", and the Omega now arrives 24 hours prior only to immediately succumb to it's injuries.\n3) Why does Cage wake up back on the helicopter instead of at Heathrow like in every previous reset?\n\nThe way the resets have been shown to work up to that point is that the \"reset-ee\" is always restored back to the last time they regained consciousness. The previous chain of events was that Cage attempted to blackmail the UNF General in order to keep himself off the front lines of Operation Downfall but was instead arrested, tazed, and knocked unconscious, waking up on a pile of gear at Heathrow to find himself demoted and branded a deserter. This becomes his \"anchor point\" for all subsequent resets.\n\nThe reason he now wakes up in the helicopter instead of at Heathrow is because the timeline has now changed. The Omega is dead. The Mimics are no longer a threat, with forces moving in on all fronts to reclaim territory with little or no resistance. Operation Downfall is presumably canceled. Cage no longer has/had any reason to blackmail the General. He never gets arrested, tazed, and knocked out to wake up at Heathrow, so the reset brings him back to his next adjusted moment of regained consciousness, which would've been waking up on the helicopter in London at the very beginning of the film.\n", "created_utc": 1460135722.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d1v590v", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_4dwf0z", "parent_id": "t1_d1uynil", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/4dwf0z/edge_of_tomorrow_sequel_is_moving_ahead/d1v590v/", "score": 76, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Tyrantt_47", "author_id": "dcswu", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "It was excellent, saw at IMAX and now have the blu-ray.

Then we could get to see Blunt's earlier self when she was the Angel of Verdun badass in the making, we could maybe even see the start of the invasion, etc. And this wouldn't require a prequel, though events would take place before the first film at times.\n\n", "created_utc": 1460128398.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d1uzkm7", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_4dwf0z", "parent_id": "t1_d1uy671", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/4dwf0z/edge_of_tomorrow_sequel_is_moving_ahead/d1uzkm7/", "score": 25, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Edge of Next Tuesday ", "created_utc": 1460125911.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d1uxrbz", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_4dwf0z", "parent_id": "t1_d1uwh3d", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/4dwf0z/edge_of_tomorrow_sequel_is_moving_ahead/d1uxrbz/", "score": 172, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "--redacted--", "author_id": "5nl1u", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "The Day After The Edge of Tomorrow", "created_utc": 1460126385.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d1uy3c3", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_4dwf0z", "parent_id": "t1_d1uwh3d", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/4dwf0z/edge_of_tomorrow_sequel_is_moving_ahead/d1uy3c3/", "score": 31, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "mypasswordisPA55WORD", "author_id": "gnuvf", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Alien groundhog day 2: Electric boogaloo", "created_utc": 1460128299.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d1uzhzg", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_4dwf0z", "parent_id": "t1_d1uwh3d", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/4dwf0z/edge_of_tomorrow_sequel_is_moving_ahead/d1uzhzg/", "score": 9, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "winterjam010", "author_id": "67g9e", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "A Good Day to Live Die Repeat", "created_utc": 1460126964.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d1uyihv", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_4dwf0z", "parent_id": "t1_d1uwh3d", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/4dwf0z/edge_of_tomorrow_sequel_is_moving_ahead/d1uyihv/", "score": 14, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "The Rise of the Dawn of the Edge of Tomorrow", "created_utc": 1460127024.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d1uyk39", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_4dwf0z", "parent_id": "t1_d1uwh3d", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/4dwf0z/edge_of_tomorrow_sequel_is_moving_ahead/d1uyk39/", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "satellite_uplink", "author_id": "df4g8", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Tomorrow", "created_utc": 1460128098.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d1uzclb", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_4dwf0z", "parent_id": "t1_d1uwh3d", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/4dwf0z/edge_of_tomorrow_sequel_is_moving_ahead/d1uzclb/", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "James_Locke", "author_id": "8hiul", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "An ending that left a bit of a cliffhanger.

The book didn't use \"alpha\" and \"drone\" to describe the mimics, but I will to keep things simple. The beta mimics were a sort of storage device, and the alpha mimic sent the reset signal. There were also a bunch of other mimics that weren't part of the time jumping, they just killed stuff (similar to the \"drones\" from the movie). To prevent a time jump, the humans had to kill the betas before killing the alpha in order to stop the signal from being sent to the past. Only Rita has discovered how to do this, and this is the reason her squad are the only humans to have any true victories.\n\nRita was simply good at killing from the beginning. Her loops were caused by killing the alpha incorrectly (she never dies once until the very end of the story). Rita develops a system with her troop where the first loop is a recon type of mission. She then informs her team of what to do in the coming attack so they can kill the alpha correctly. However, in the first loop Keiji becomes connected to the alpha by killing it with a melee attack. In all the other loops, Rita is responsible for resetting the loops by killing the alpha (not Keiji's deaths). For some reason she doesn't receive the signal and can't remember all the loops Keiji experiences. So she never breaks out of the \"recon mode\" and never kills the alpha correctly.\n\nThey both are still linked to the alpha however, and they find this out by working together and killing the betas first, and then the alpha, and then the loop restarts again. Keiji tells Rita what happened and how they failed. In this final loop the mimics attack the base preemptively, and Rita and Keiji start killing beta mimics like usual. However before killing the alpha, Rita turns on Keiji and tells him that one of them needs to die before the survivor kills the alpha because they are both linked to it.\n\nKeiji has based his whole fighting style by watching Rita fight so he knows exactly how to kill her. He kills her, kills the alpha, then kills the remaining mimics. He then becomes the new hero of the war, and the war continues on.", "created_utc": 1460132496.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1460132903.0, "id": "d1v2q27", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_4dwf0z", "parent_id": "t1_d1uzden", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/4dwf0z/edge_of_tomorrow_sequel_is_moving_ahead/d1v2q27/", "score": 27, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Sloth859", "author_id": "9lswm", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "They both become Bill Murray after 10,000 years.", "created_utc": 1460140333.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d1v8t5b", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_4dwf0z", "parent_id": "t1_d1uzden", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/4dwf0z/edge_of_tomorrow_sequel_is_moving_ahead/d1v8t5b/", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "cherrybombstation", "author_id": "uk7j2", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Unlike the movie, the book's ending makes sense.

We're talking five hundred years ago, now.\"  \n  \n\"I think I read a comic about Mushashi once.[vagabond]\"  \n  \n\"Damn kids. Wouldn't know Bokuden from Batman.\"  \n  \nFerrell sighed in exasperation. There I was, pure-blooded Japanese, and he knew more about my country's history than I did. \"Samurai were warriors who earned their living fighting, just like you and me. How many people do you think the samurai I just named killed in their lifetimes?\"  \n  \n\"I dunno. If their names are still around after five hundred years, maybe... ten or twenty?\"  \n  \n\"Not even close. The records from back then are sketchy, but the number is somewhere between three and five hundred. Each. They didn't have guns. They didn't have bombs. Every single man they killed they cut down in hand-to-fucking-hand combat. I'd say that'd be enough to warrant a medal or two.\"  \n  \n\"How'd they do it?\"  \n  \n\"Send one man to the great beyond each week, then do the same for ten years, you'll have your five hundred. That's why they're known as master swordsmen. They didn't just kill once and call it a day. They kept going. And they got better.\"  \n  \n\"Sounds like a video game. The more you kill, the stronger you get - that it? Shit, I got a lot of catching up to do.\"  \n  \n\"Except their opponents weren't training dummies or little digital aliens. These were living, breathing men they slaughtered. Like cattle. Men with swords. Men fighting for their lives, same as them. If they wanted to live, they had to catch their enemy off-guard, lay traps, and sometimes run away with their tail between their legs.\"  \n  \nNot the first image that sprang into your head when you thought of master swordsmen.  \n  \n\"Learning what would get you killed and how to get your enemy killed - the only way to know a thing like that is to do it. Some kid who'd been taught how to swing a sword in a dojo didn't stand a chance against a man who'd been tested in battle. They knew it, and they kept doing it. That's how they piled up hundreds of corpses. One swing at a time.\"  \n  \n\"Kiri-oboeru.\"  (This excerpt made me obsessed with Mushashi) \n  \nHe then teaches Keiji how to use the exo-suit without inertia restriction.  After doing that for a bunch of loops he realizes that the FMB fights without the inertia restriction too and its why she uses a battle ax.  When Keiji first tries out the battle ax he rotates his spine out of his back because when he swung it, the exo-suit didnt stop the inertia of swinging a giant metal ax because the restrictions were off.  He studies up on FMB some more the next day and realizes she never misses a swing. Meaning, Rita was using the battle axes collision with a mimic as her inertia stopper, and if she missed once she woulda torn out her spine.
