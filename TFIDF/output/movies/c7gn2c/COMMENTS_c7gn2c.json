Craig's run has definitely had the most consistently-modern style of performance at its core.\n\nSort of the same reason that the Bond movies themselves have changed -- what was expected (in terms of structure, narrative, style) of an action film in the 60s and 70s is very different than what is expected of an action film today.\n\nAnd of course nostalgia plays a part too.
