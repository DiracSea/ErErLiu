really touching and interesting.

Stone then went off and made a black & white short film starring himself as a traumatized, disabled Vietnam veteran (which is what he was) wandering around NYC and at the end (implied) committing suicide. He was nervous because he didn't connect with the other students, who were were anti-war and thought Stone was weird (he was, he had bad PTSD at the time and admittedly would sit in the back and not talk and was alienating). But Scorsese's complimented his film in front of all the other students..Then, recognizing that his student was going through something, Scorsese invited Stone out for coffee and to talk. Stone said Scorsese was just an amazing listener when he just started dumping out all these feelings and dreams to him about being a filmmaker. Scorsese just accepted them and would ask the perfect questions and it was amazing to have someone take him seriously and not think he was crazy.

The winning twenty-five million dollar bid would barely cover the very first phase of research costs involved in the creation of any dinosaur, let alone a novel hybrid like the Indominus Rex or Indoraptor. In real-life, you'd be looking at a winning bid in the high hundreds of millions, at the very least, because Eli was looking to make a quick buck from the sale. Many of those looking to turn the dinosaurs into living weapons would likely have hundreds of millions in the bank as it is, and are basically buying low, to sell high. Keep in mind, that as long as Dr. Henry Wu is around, they can make more dinosaurs under the nose of the public to sell later, and potentially make them to order. They're basically not selling an endangered species, they're selling the first batch. Same reason the park was falling off visitors (although it felt more telling than showing), dinosaur genes are old news. People probably can do some themselves, but Dr. Henry Wu or John Hammond had the Jurassic Park genes patented, so you have to buy that stuff illegally or take a cheap knock-off by a rival genetic engineering team. Alright, but does this really mean that these rare creatures are worth way less than football stars? Because that still sounds dopey. Plus, isn't Eli super loaded, anyways? What does he need that money for so desperately? That California mansion was worth more than the dinosaurs combined, I bet.

Let's say the buzz around that movie will not only keep existing subscribers but maybe attract some new ones. 1% of their userbase alone will pay for the entire movie in a year or so.
