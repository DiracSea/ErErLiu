The Soviets ordered museums to open up their collection to the movie production, so many of the props and interiors are actually filled with real period candle holders, art, dinnerware, tables, chairs, etc. Even many of those cannons are real and firing real artillery.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the burning of Moscow they built a gigantic set and actually burned it all down with kerosene, so all those shots you see are people actually in the middle of a huge fire....This movie was probably dangerous as hell to film and we will see nothing like it again, but damn it is an incredible spectacle. The battle sequences are on the scale of something like Lord of the Rings and every single person is a real soldier, no CGI and no tricks. It is the closest any of us will ever get to watching a real Napoleonic era army fight. It is glorious to watch and most war movie buffs have never seen or heard of it.
