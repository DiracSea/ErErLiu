As a Colombian is very frustrating. I always have to clarify to my American friends the following \n\n-It was NOTHING like Narcos \n\n-He was a monster,  a horrible psychopath who killed and tortured hundreds of people. He fueled the drug market in Colombia leaving millions of innocent people stranded in the middle of a terrible war that \u00fatil this day has taken the lives of hundreds of thousands and affected almost every person in the country. We all have to live with the stigma of cocaine trade everywhere we go. Decades of poverty, violence and exploitation, that his legacy, nothing more.\n\n-He was considered a \u201cHero\u201d by a very few people from \u201clas comunas\u201d (basically Medellin Favelas) the reason behind it is that he invested a lot of money in this poor and neglected areas with the intention of recruiting young people to expand his reign of terror. In the comunas he crafted a web of hired killers (as young as twelve years old) child prostitution, micro trafficking, cocaine kitchens and worst. His goal was to become a politician to avoid extradition that\u2019s why he tried so hard to gain popularity among poor people. \n\n-99.9% of Colombians hate him... We don\u2019t look up to him in any fucking way and it\u2019s a dark and shameful part of our history.\n\n-Every time I see his fucking face plastered in a T-shirt I feel sick. To see him being glorified by Hollywood and to read so many supportive comments is terrible. Just portraying him in a seemingly positive way is a huge disrespect for the victims and an immense proof of ignorance that\u2019s beyond my understanding. There\u2019s this narrative that basically turned him into an \u201cantihero rebel\u201d who cared for his people which cannot be farther from reality. \n\n-Netflix didn\u2019t care that the wives, mothers, sons and daughters of the victims had to see this garbage of human being glorified in a show that was full of lies, where fiction was presented as reality. It really felt that they were using our pain for entertainment. \n\n", "created_utc": 1538761601.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e78712d", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_9llrg1", "parent_id": "t3_9llrg1", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/9llrg1/javier_bardem_plays_pablo_escobar_without_glamour/e78712d/", "score": 24, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "DragonDrawbar", "author_id": "aqesihj", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "What is this crazy fascination with Escobar?

As a Colombian is very frustrating. I always have to clarify to my American friends the following \n\n-It was NOTHING like Narcos \n\n-He was a monster,  a horrible psychopath who killed and tortured hundreds of people. He fueled the drug market in Colombia leaving millions of innocent people stranded in the middle of a terrible war that \u00fatil this day has taken the lives of hundreds of thousands and affected almost every person in the country. We all have to live with the stigma of cocaine trade everywhere we go. Decades of poverty, violence and exploitation, that his legacy, nothing more.\n\n-He was considered a \u201cHero\u201d by a very few people from \u201clas comunas\u201d (basically Medellin Favelas) the reason behind it is that he invested a lot of money in this poor and neglected areas with the intention of recruiting young people to expand his reign of terror. In the comunas he crafted a web of hired killers (as young as twelve years old) child prostitution, micro trafficking, cocaine kitchens and worst. His goal was to become a politician to avoid extradition that\u2019s why he tried so hard to gain popularity among poor people. \n\n-99.9% of Colombians hate him... We don\u2019t look up to him in any fucking way and it\u2019s a dark and shameful part of our history.\n\n-Every time I see his fucking face plastered in a T-shirt I feel sick. To see him being glorified by Hollywood and to read so many supportive comments is terrible. Just portraying him in a seemingly positive way is a huge disrespect for the victims and an immense proof of ignorance that\u2019s beyond my understanding. There\u2019s this narrative that basically turned him into an \u201cantihero rebel\u201d who cared for his people which cannot be farther from reality. \n\n-Netflix didn\u2019t care that the wives, mothers, sons and daughters of the victims had to see this garbage of human being glorified in a show that was full of lies, where fiction was presented as reality. It really felt that they were using our pain for entertainment. \n\n", "created_utc": 1538761291.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1538761516.0, "id": "e786nc4", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_9llrg1", "parent_id": "t1_e77ogby", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/9llrg1/javier_bardem_plays_pablo_escobar_without_glamour/e786nc4/", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "DragonDrawbar", "author_id": "aqesihj", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Um, by my count, 6 more?", "created_utc": 1538747383.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1538749370.0, "id": "e77pwg2", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_9llrg1", "parent_id": "t1_e77ogby", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/9llrg1/javier_bardem_plays_pablo_escobar_without_glamour/e77pwg2/", "score": 19, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "ZippyDan", "author_id": "34c95", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "But we haven't gotten good Pablo Escobar movies yet, just the Narcos show and the Colombian novelas.
