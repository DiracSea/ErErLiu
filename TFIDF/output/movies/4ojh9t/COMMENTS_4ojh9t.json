Then, they had their first big quarter in terms of subscribers after House of Cards season 1 was released. This made the stock take off. It went from the low $100 to over $200 over the course of a few months. And, then, some shakey news came through ,investors got nervous. And, thing started to slowly slide. I put an auto-sell-all in if the price dipped below $170 because I knew I would make some money - and, the volatility was uneasy for me. Even though I knew it was worth a lot more! I didn't think it would hit $170 though.\n\nAnyway, it went below $170 for about 3 hours. All my shares sold. And over the next two years, I watch as it climbed to nearly $700/share, and then the 7-to-1 split. \n\nI'm not sure if it's better to have loved and lost (out on a shit ton of money). Or, to have never loved.

The idea was to get into a price war and eventually force Netflix to give up. \n\nThey couldn't have bungled the shit out of this endeavor more if they had tried.\n\nThey put an outside guy in charge of the project who had once written a computer language (or something - I forget), and had massive developer god syndrome. He thought because he was good at coding (and because BB had put him in charge) that he was a genius, and that he would be amazing at marketing as well. He wasn't either. \n\nHe made some very shady decisions (like building a site that showed certain movies were available even though BB didn't have them in stock), and personality wise alienated pretty much everybody with his tantrums.\n\nI believe they also staunchly refused to get rid of their late fees model, although they relaxed it slightly. You were only going to be allowed to check out the DVDs for a certain number of days, and then you had to return them.
