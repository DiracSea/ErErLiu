I agree with you, but then I look at the others nominated and I think I can see how Argo won. \n\nLincoln: A lot of folks probably voted for this one and it certainly has the pedigree, but it\u2019s also very traditional Oscar bait down to the boring title and since Daniel Day Lewis was a lock for best actor, I could see people less eager to give Spielberg another one.\n\nBeasts of the Southern Wild: Like it or not, the Academy tends to award past performance as much as the actual film under examination. That being said, can you remember anyone involved with this movie that isn\u2019t named Quvenzhane? A best actress nom for a preteen is more than enough for an indie from first time directors. This is what I think should have won, but I had no illusions it would.\n\nDjango Unchained: If Inglorious Basterds didn\u2019t do it, this one wasn\u2019t going to either. I lot of people probably liked this one, but not enough to give it best picture since it\u2019s kind of a retread for Tarantino (same for Hateful 8). Once Upon a Time in Hollywood may pull it off though.\n\n Life of Pi: This one probably got some votes if Ang Lee\u2019s director win means anything, but I think there\u2019d be just as many for Lincoln and Argo and PI is a little \u201cweirder\u201d than the others so it probably suffered even if people loved the direction and visuals.\n\nSilver Linings Playbook: I wasn\u2019t upset on the night of the awards that Argo won because I was afraid this would win. It\u2019s fine, but it\u2019s all hype. Lawrence\u2019s best actress win from an overacted role she was miscast in just seemed like the culmination of her indomitable popularity during that time period. She\u2019s a great actor and everyone loved and probably still does love her, but I think they just really wanted to give her the award. And her tripping on the way up to accept it probably skyrocketed their mentions for the next few weeks. David O Russel was on his hot streak at that time too. I like the actors in David O Russel movies much more than I ever like the movies they are a part of. Silver Linings, The Fighter, American Hustle: great performances, everything else is mediocre. I\u2019m sure this movie did get a lot of votes, but this movie would all seem a lot less \u201cimportant\u201d than many of the weightier movies here and I\u2019m sure that had an effect on its votes.\n\nZero Dark Thirty: I feel like this movie split votes with Argo and Lincoln as they are all historical period pieces about American history. Lincoln probably came off a bit too measured and boring for many, Zero Dark Thirty was pretty good, but it wasn\u2019t the hit Argo was and it wasn\u2019t as funny as Argo was. \n\nI think ultimately Argo checked the same boxes as it\u2019s closest competitors while seeming more fresh. Also the guy that directed in it starred in it and I bet there\u2019s a fondness for the ambition of that in Academy voters.\n\nI left out Les Miserables because it was good, but it was there so they could feature songs and draw that crowd in.", "created_utc": 1571867731.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "f4xpnjd", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_dlzhqz", "parent_id": "t1_f4vxur0", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/dlzhqz/its_official_sony_will_campaign_leonardo_dicaprio/f4xpnjd/", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Category3Water", "author_id": "pdpc8", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "That asshat, I actually don't mind Affleck in certain situations but it bothers me as a Canadian that he modified the true story to make it appeal to Americans.", "created_utc": 1571867882.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "f4xqfhr", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_dlzhqz", "parent_id": "t1_f4vxur0", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/dlzhqz/its_official_sony_will_campaign_leonardo_dicaprio/f4xqfhr/", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "arealhumannotabot", "author_id": "1tqpx6th", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I remember that exact moment very well.
