When the contract came up for renewal Starz wanted double/triple. Disney movies were previously on Netflix through Starz since they had first run of newly release Disney movies for a while. \n\nIncidentally the Starz contract was probably awful for Netflix just because of how absolutely half-assed the content they gave them was.
