Warner Brothers fought with them at first but eventually let them exist as long as they didn't make any money from it. \n\nThey made a sequel and did a stage reading of the third one (which included Evanna Lynch, the actress for Luna Lovegood in the movies, as Luna Lovegood) but weren't able to do a full production because the actor who played Harry, Darren Criss, was too busy as an actor on Glee. \n\n\nWhenever I see fan content like this that is well liked and becomes very popular, I always think the rights holders are kind of dumb to view it in an adversarial way. Fan content is good for the brand's relevancy in people's minds. It's free marketing for them. I think it'd be way smarter to give the groups a license in cases like these to actually make money from the IP and try to make it bigger. I know AVPM would have been even better marketing for Harry Potter in the long term if they'd been allowed to make money off of it. Instead, the group pretty much stopped doing parodies and only does original productions now which are not nearly as popular (or as good).", "created_utc": 1553795354.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "ejlao1q", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_b6l2pm", "parent_id": "t3_b6l2pm", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/b6l2pm/alien_helmer_ridley_scott_gives_thumbs_up_to_high/ejlao1q/", "score": 680, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "BigOlBortles", "author_id": "39s5w82g", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Wording of that title had me confused for way to long.

They may only want their characters doing certain things or having certain qualities. If enough fan content is being released, they can start to lose this control.

Even at the height of their power they were outnumbered by their nearest rivals. As military powerhouses, they were nothing.\n\nBut culturally? The Middle Age Papacy called the Crusades to retake the Holiest city in the world from the barbarous, infidel Muslims. As a symbol of their religion, imagine the pain that it would have caused the leader of Christendom to see the land that Jesus walked in desecrated by these foreign invaders - and that's the thing, despite not controlling Jerusalem for centuries, the Papacy seemed to think it was always Christian, they just had to take it back. For them, Jerusalem was priceless.\n\nFor those who Crusaded to the Holy Land, Jerusalem was salvation. Dying on Crusade was a literal Get Our of Jail free card. Any -any- sin, could be absolved as long as you died on Crusade. Murder? Adultery? Usury? All the big ones, just travel to liberate the Kingdom of Heaven's earthly exemplar. And if you don't die? Well, you can make a name for yourself, you can secure some lands, maybe your kids might become nobles or even princes and kings. And you still have that absolution, awesome.\n\nFor those living, born there, it was their home. It was all they knew. The locals sometimes were exasperated by these Crusaders coming and pushing off their neighbors - think Brendan Gleeson in this film, although ironically the Templars knew and played the local politics well, and often tried to tone down the actions of those from overseas. Imagine your home being used as a cause to go to war by people who had never lived there against the neighbors you knew and traded with, knew as friends sometimes, and certainly knew were more powerful than you were.\n\nSo the Kingdom is worth a lot, if you're thinking in one way. But he first says 'Nothing', before he says 'Everything'. Because the Kingdom of Jerusalem was a miserable little spit of land, few natural resources, few natural defences and areas to defend. Saladin could have quite happily made it a client kingdom - except, of course, he had his own religious fanatics pushing him to war, just as in this film the fanatics of Christendom forced a war for their own views. \n\nBut of course the question goes both ways. What is the Kingdom of Jerusalem worth? Is it really worth salvation, do the titles really mean anything, is it worth it to fight and die over? Is the Kingdom worth the deaths of all those in Jerusalem?\n\nIn the end Orlando decides '...no. The kingdom is what we make it, and we carry it with us. It isn't land. And it isn't worth dying over.' And so he makes a decision that none of the fanatics would have understood.

There were a number of reasons for the Crusades, which, frankly, Jerusalem and its owner were just one factor.\n\nLike you say the Byzantines had been asking for help for centuries. Sure, but not in some kind of pan-Christian good feeling. The Great Schism centuries before did not endear the Byzantines to the Popes. The Emperor in Constantinople practically saw himself as God's representative on earth. He appealed for aid from specific kingdoms even as others fought against him - 1071 the last Byzantine holding in Italy, Bari, fell to the Normans, and they continued to plague the Byzantines for years after. That's just two decades before Clermont. And keep in mind, the one Crusade that could seriously be laid at the door of Byzantine requests for aid ended in Constantinople being conquered twice, without a drop of Muslim blood bring spilled.\n\nChristian suffering did happen under Muslim rule, of course it did. Was it systemic? Debatable. Perhaps under specific, localised leaders, sure. The sack of the Holy Sepulchre was cited as a cause for the calling of the First Crusade. But that happened in 1009. If it was that big a catalyst, why would it take another 85 years for the Crusade to actually be called? Muslim rule was in many places fairly benign to Christians, and Jews. As Peoples of the Book, they were specifically heralded as special and worthy of protection. Not as good as Muslims, sure, but the dhimmis could pay the jizya (taxes) each year and they were likely fine. Many Christians and Jews prospered under Muslim rule. Things weren't all sunshine and rainbows (especially under the more fundamentalist regimes) but they weren't flaying and torturing every day either.\n\nThe biggest factors I can see for the Crusades were the growth of the political arm of the Papacy, the growing combining of military and religious service, and the inheritance laws of the nobility.\n\nThe Papacy was flexing its muscles. Having a number of kingdoms that effectively only functioned at the behest of Papal approval was a powerful, and very lucrative, thing. The Pope was kingmaker. Just 30 years before the Crusade, William the Bastard of Normandy was able to secure funds and religious approval for his conquest of England. That's a Christian king being told by his Spiritual liege that it was fine to go and kill another Christian king. God approved of violence, and violence against other Christians, too. That was huge. And of course, Christianity and warfare go much farther back than that - Constantine the Great's battle at the Milvian Bridge drew on Christian symbology, Saxon poems in the tenth century talk about Christ as a warrior figure. But the Christians were becoming increasingly comfortable with allying warfare to religion. It could be argued that this was a natural response to Muslim aggression in Spain, but honestly there isn't much evidence to suggest the Christian's cared about the inner religious thinking of the Muslims of the time - Crusades were not an answer to jihad, that incredibly misunderstood term.\n\nAdd to this, Europe was lousy with nobility with nothing to do. First sons inherited the land, but second sons? Third, fourth? It's not a coincidence that the First Crusade was led and largely populated with second sons and lower. Very few first sons went, and those that did tended to have nothing waiting for them back home anyway. Later Crusades were led by kings and entire countries - Richard practically sacked his own kingdom, spent less than a year in it his whole reign and let it rot under Prince John (eventually eading to the Magna Carta - yay), all because he felt himself a conquering warrior of God. That was about prestige, in many cases, and Crusading became something of a more militant pilgrimage.\n\nUrban II distilled all of this in a powerful series of speeches across France. Sure, the instigator of this was Alexios appealing for aid. He asked Urban (interesting he didn't ask a king - the Pope had much greater reach than any kings of Europe at the time) for aid. Urban used this to preach a new kind of war, yet based on historical precedent. The marrying of fighting and *salvation*, that was a key development. These men were told that killing and fighting for God was a pathway to Heaven. If you get yourself some land in the process, great, you get to keep it. \n\nHe absolutely referenced Christians and helping the Greeks. But I think it's clear that while this was a motivator it was not the ultimate aim of the First Crusade, and certainly not many of the later ones. And Alexios didn't expect this kind of response, and certainly not on this scale. I think he expected maybe a few bored lord's sons and their retinues, some mercenaries, maybe, some cash. He expected the kind of Frankish forces he and his predecessors had fought in Italy and the Balkans. But when the Crusaders arrived in Byzantine lands, he didn't consolidate with them. He didn't reconquer Anatolia, his motivation for asking for help. He gave them supplies, and waved them on their way as quickly as possible. He knew the trouble they would cause, and wanted none of it - the Crusaders were disorganized, poorly formed and led, and belligerent.
