He located another, placed it over the first one. Contact ignited a frenzied squirming in the grains. Their silk locked and they became a single membrane which enclosed him to the elbow. The corn adjusted to the living glove of childhood play, but thinner and more sensitive as he lured it into the role of a skin symbiote. He reached down with the living glove, felt dirt, each clump distinct to his senses. This was no longer corn; it was tougher, stronger. And it would grow stronger and stronger . . . His groping hand encountered more ears which whipped itself into union with the first two and adapted itself to the new role. Pebbled softness insinuated itself up his arm to his shoulder. With a terrible singleness of concentration he achieved the union of his new skin with his body, preventing rejection. No corner of his attention was left to dwell upon the terrifying consequences of what he did here. Only the necessities of his trance vision mattered. Only the Golden Brown Path could come from this ordeal. Kyle shed his robe and lay naked upon the soil, his gloved arm outstretched into the path of swaying corn. He remembered that once he and Amanda had caught a corn, abraded it against the ground until it contracted into the masa, a churro, its interior pregnant with the chocolate syrup. One bit gently upon the end and sucked swiftly before the wound was healed, gaining the few drops of sweetness. They were all over his body now. He could feel the pulse of his blood against the living membrane. One tried to cover his face, but he moved it roughly until it elongated into a thin tortilla. The thing grew much longer than the churro, remaining flexible. Kyle bit the end of it, tasted a thin stream of sweetness which continued far longer than any farmer had ever before experienced. He could feel energy from the high fructose flow through him. A curious excitement suffused his body. He was kept busy for a time rolling the membrane away from his face until he'd built up a stiff ridge circling from jaw to forehead and leaving his ears exposed.\n\n[71018-4: Corn Cob Guy](https://brickset.com/sets/71018-4) [[Photo]](https://images.brickset.com/sets/images/71018-4.jpg)", "created_utc": 1552939260.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "eitqi42", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_b2kk8u", "parent_id": "t1_eitgppw", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/b2kk8u/hans_zimmer_is_set_to_compose_the_score_for_denis/eitqi42/", "score": 99, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Cyno01", "author_id": "4pjz1", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "The corn must pop.", "created_utc": 1552934240.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "eitjh9p", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_b2kk8u", "parent_id": "t1_eitgppw", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/b2kk8u/hans_zimmer_is_set_to_compose_the_score_for_denis/eitjh9p/", "score": 27, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "optagon", "author_id": "5qam6", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "The high fructose corn syrup must flow", "created_utc": 1552936152.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1552990675.0, "id": "eitm8q8", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_b2kk8u", "parent_id": "t1_eitgppw", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/b2kk8u/hans_zimmer_is_set_to_compose_the_score_for_denis/eitm8q8/", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "ZippyDan", "author_id": "34c95", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "The fremen called it maize.", "created_utc": 1552944923.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "eityhck", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_b2kk8u", "parent_id": "t1_eitgppw", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/b2kk8u/hans_zimmer_is_set_to_compose_the_score_for_denis/eityhck/", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Christian Bale set to undergo his greatest film transition yet when he will genetically engineer himself into a half sand worm half man to play the god emperor Leto II Atreides.\n", "created_utc": 1552940796.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "eitsmcm", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_b2kk8u", "parent_id": "t1_eitp2nt", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/b2kk8u/hans_zimmer_is_set_to_compose_the_score_for_denis/eitsmcm/", "score": 334, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "0b0011", "author_id": "sxjwh48", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Noice", "created_utc": 1552949637.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "eiu4y3y", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_b2kk8u", "parent_id": "t1_eitph3q", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/b2kk8u/hans_zimmer_is_set_to_compose_the_score_for_denis/eiu4y3y/", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "nodnodwinkwink", "author_id": "45x9t", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Fuuuuucccccckkkkkk", "created_utc": 1552946189.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "eiu09hj", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_b2kk8u", "parent_id": "t1_eitywg9", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/b2kk8u/hans_zimmer_is_set_to_compose_the_score_for_denis/eiu09hj/", "score": 81, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "red_eleven", "author_id": "8b68p", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Is that to give the kid playing Paul Atreides time to age up and get a tan?

For Dune, as you note a lot of it is with the style and plot.  It is also old sci-fi, in that it was written in 1965, so there were quite a few guesses as to future or advanced technology (shields vs lasguns and such).\n\nFor LOTR, I think the problem was mostly the scope.  You had the challenge of releasing a 3 hour movie that was only the first part of the three part story.  If that first movie wasn't received well, well good luck with your other two.  Also though I think it was kind of untested ground in terms of genre.  I'm struggling to think of many ultra successful high fantasy films that preceded it and were also targeted at adults.  Yes, LOTR has appeal to kids and teens, but a lot of fantasy movies are *only* for kids and teens.  So yea, just different kinds of challenges.  \n\nBut I do remember almost everyone who was a fan of LOTR being very skeptical of the movies being any good before they came out.  Most of even the diehard fans accept them as ok adaptations of the source material and as good movies (if they don't, I think they just aren't being realistic about the medium, though I do have a few minor gripes with Jackson's decisions).  It was really a tough job adapting something that has such a rabid fan base.  They had to make it appeal to them but also to people who had never heard of LOTR.\n\nOn the whole though I'd have to say adapting Dune is harder.  Especially with the Bene Gesserit stuff.
