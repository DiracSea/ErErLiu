Perhaps an imperfect analogy, but bear with me.  \n\nAt a daycare I know of picking your child up on time was a rule, but it was also rarely enforced. Parents would typically police themselves simply out of guilt. The day care would also be very understanding of emergencies. Shit happens.  \n\nEventually the day care imposed a fine for picking children up late. Suddenly the number of kids picked up late increased. Perplexing. See, the parents had been guilted into doing the right thing before, and never really thought of even doing it to begin with. But when you impose a fine, you're really just putting a price on it.  \n\nEven worse, when the daycare removed the fine, things didnt return to normal. The late pick ups increased even more, as the parents who couldnt afford the fine were now absolved of both guilt and monetary payment.  \n\nTL:DR People typically police themselves via their own morals. Laws don't really do anything to stop people, they are really there to punish people who break them. But put the idea into peoples minds that \"its ok\" and the morality of things begins to break down. At least for some, who are a little closer to the so called \"line\".", "created_utc": 1517362293.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dthv7rl", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7u3248", "parent_id": "t1_dthl2ve", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7u3248/the_first_purge_official_poster/dthv7rl/", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "ManStacheAlt", "author_id": "wl9g9", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Except anyone with stuff worth looking is gunna have paid guards with top of the line gear protecting their stuff", "created_utc": 1517352558.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dthm9d0", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7u3248", "parent_id": "t1_dthl9yp", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7u3248/the_first_purge_official_poster/dthm9d0/", "score": 46, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "chironomidae", "author_id": "60mj4", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": ">People don't want to commit crimes\n\nBut people are still getting raped...", "created_utc": 1517353038.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dthmqcx", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7u3248", "parent_id": "t1_dthl9yp", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7u3248/the_first_purge_official_poster/dthmqcx/", "score": 27, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "heydabop", "author_id": "6d07q", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Even in the movies, a large number of people just go into hiding.
