When 28 days later came out, there really wasn't anything like it except for Dawn of the dead remake which did come around a month or so before this was shown in the states. I remember talking with my sister after dawn came out, that UK had their own movie with fast zombies and it was supposed to be better. Anyways, during this time, the idea of running zombies was fresh and new, this type of horror movie really didn't hit mainstream yet, so the public wasn't sensitized to it yet. Games like left 4 dead or dayz had not been out. So basically it was all very new, and you didn't know what to expect yet. \n\nThe genre now however is basically done for as there isn't anything new that can be done. From slow reanimated dead that takes days to infect you after being bitten, to fast running, fast turning viruses, to demons being the cause, to everyone already being infected and will turn into a zombie regardless of what you do.\n\nThis style of movie was amazing, but it would be hard for them to ever come out with anything that will touch you like this did, because these movies was made for a time when zombies wasn't plastered everywhere.\n\nWhich reminds me of another movie that had a pretty original concept that blew me away, War of the worlds.
