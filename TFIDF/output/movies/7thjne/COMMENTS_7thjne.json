But, on to the opinion piece (spoiling the entire ending here, ye've been warned).\n\n[The Moon King's comeuppance. Okay, this one really truly bothered me. Erasing his memory and convincing him he was always a nice guy is an incredibly morally grey ending that I didn't like at all. Considering he already had one of Kubo's eyes, I would've thought they could have him \"see the true value of family\" and come to live honestly among the people rather than having to completely erase his history. The Moon King learning to redeem himself through kindness would've been a much more emotionally impactful and honest ending in my opinion, and effectively brainwashing him to be kind is a bit of a cop-out. I loved everything up until this resolution and it still bugs me.](#spoiler)\n\n[I also thought that the story would've been better suited had he not found his true dad and mom until he prayed at the same grave he prayed at in the beginning. I thought that the Monkey guardian and his father's lieutenant were perfect as surrogate parents for the adventure. Because the reveal happens so close to their 'true' deaths it made the impact of his mother's death seem less meaningful while also taking away from their actual death because we'd already seen/heard about them dying before.](#spoiler)\n\n[Also y u no have Little Hanzo become Big Hanzo and have Kubo defeat the Moon Beast using a giant fuck-off origami samurai?](#spoiler)", "created_utc": 1517121631.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dtct3li", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7thjne", "parent_id": "t3_7thjne", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7thjne/kubo_and_the_two_strings_is_an_absolute/dtct3li/", "score": 6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "girlritchie", "author_id": "kyfhcaj", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I saw it with some friends a couple of days after it came out in cinemas.

I could actually rant about how much I dislike them all day, but I will attempt to summarize everything into a few sentences. Their entire public image, how they sell their movies, is a lie. It's debatable if you can call what they do stop motion at this point. Huge amounts of their moves are just flat out digitally animated and the entirety of every movie gets a lot of digital effects added afterwards. On top of that their stop motion mannequins are actually incredibly basic. They render the entire file in 3d animation software, then 3d print most frames and snap them only their crappy mannequins. They do this for most of the character's movement and all facial movements. They might as well just do the whole film in a computer, at least then they would be more honest about their process, but the rich kid who started Laika likes to play with dolls.
