It was certainly for how good he was in Boogie Nights sure, but I also like to think that a part of it would have been the Acadamy saying, that's Burt fucking Reynolds. Who was not only a great actor but he was a goddamn Movie Star who put a lot of butts in the seats; and for good reason.*   \n  \n\n>Nearly a generation has passed since [Burt Reynolds's](https://www.gq.com/story/burt-reynolds-trump-toupee-paul-thomas-anderson) last movie of note: Boogie Nights, the 1997 Paul Thomas Anderson masterpiece in which Reynolds played, with disquieting authenticity, the porn titan Jack Horner. It's easy to believe the real Reynolds is somewhere in that character (which won him a Golden Globe), especially when you go back one more generation and remember the schticky, toupee'd boob he perfected in the late-70s and early-80s: Smokey and the Bandit, Cannonball Run, Stroker Ace, Sharky's Machine. (Reynolds cemented his image as a kind of high-redneck Lothario when he married Loni Anderson in 1988, then lost a shit-ton of money in their divorce five years later.) What's too easily forgotten is that there was a time (1978 to 1982), when Reynolds was the number-one box-office star in America\u2014and anchoring landmark films that are not just classics of the male-experience (The Longest Yard, Semi-Tough), but also on the National Film Registry (Deliverance).\n> \n>   \n  \nEast bound and down, loaded up and truckin',  \n\nWe're gonna do what they say can't be done.  \n\nWe've got a long way to go and a short time to get there.  \n\nI'm east bound, just watch ol' \"Bandit\" run.\n      \n-----\n  \n\n*Thanks for all the memories Burt.*", "created_utc": 1536261511.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1536261848.0, "id": "e5ifusx", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_9dlpy4", "parent_id": "t3_9dlpy4", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/9dlpy4/burt_reynolds_dies_at_82/e5ifusx/", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "rainman18", "author_id": "4g5ev", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "R.I.P to a icon.
