[{"body": "I wrote about this once, but Mr. Rogers saved my mother's sanity. \n\nMy brother was sick as a child and needed to see specialists who couldn't really give my mother a real diagnosis. Psychiatric conditions? Allergies? Neurological? Whatever it was, my brother was in a lot of pain and the ONLY thing that could routinely calm him and keep him happy was to watch Mr. Rogers. We'd watch it together every afternoon, my mom called PBS and they *sent* her VHS of the episodes. \n\nI don't know why, but she wrote him a letter thanking him. A couple of weeks later my mother receives a letter back. It's a typed letter and she assumes a form letter, but she reads it. The letter discusses how much he loves to read letters and how my brother's condition is exacerbated by the fact that doctors forget that children are children. It's a long letter - a full page - and references things my mother wrote. It's signed, in ink \"Fred Rogers.\" \n\nMy mother still has that letter, it's in a box, she had it framed. It was getting bleached, so she's put it somewhere where it won't deteriorate. My brother's condition was diagnosed and treated. That was more than 30 years ago, but that letter was *never* forgotten. I remember her taking it out when Fred Rogers died and we all read it. \n\nIt's one of those things that seems so trivial, but at the time probably meant the world to my mother and for that, I will always have a hard time reading about Mr. Rogers and not tearing up. I bought copies of his show to show my son because years later, it's the only thing worth watching. It never took children for granted, and even I love watching him. Looking forward to sharing that with my son. \n", "created_utc": 1517259380.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1517332094.0, "id": "dtfhvxo", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7tudsh", "parent_id": "t3_7tudsh", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7tudsh/tom_hanks_to_play_mr_rogers_in_you_are_my_friend/dtfhvxo/", "score": 6177, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "*The film is inspired by a real-life friendship between Fred Rogers and award-winning journalist Tom Junod.

Introduce reporter\n2. Illustrate his cynical pessimistic look at the world\n3. Introduce the McGuffin of him being assigned a story he doesn't want.\n4. Introduce Mr. Rogers\n5. Immediately show how different they are.\n6. End Act 1 with a mild conflict\n\nAct 2 (Middle 40-50 minutes or so)\n1. The reporter tries to find superficial things to prove his preconceived notions\n2. Doesn't find them in Mr. Rogers.\n3. Progressively illustrate with each bigger and deeper issue the reporter discusses, Mr. Rogers will have an eloquent and wholesome spin\n4. Climax with Mr. Rogers using some real wholesome Dad-like wisdom to cut through like a knife about how you don't have to be what the world tells you and everything is perspective.. yadda yadda yadda\n\nAct 3: (Final 15-20 minutes or so)\n1. The reporter realizes the errors to his pessimism and slowly starts to blossom as a new person progressively opening more and more up to Mr. Rogers philosophy on life and how to live it.\n2. Ends with some illustration of how they stayed friends for a long time or some shit like that. Maybe some poignient message about how being nice isn't that hard and to look for the good in people.\n\nThrow in some mention of past life events and that's pretty much it. I could be completely wrong and I probably am but it was still fun trying to plot this movie out. I'm excited for this. Tom Hanks does great with these types of characters. It reminds me of his portrayal of Walt Disney in Saving Mr. Banks. I think this will be the most Tom Hanksian role of all time unless some day Tom Hanks decides to do the ultimate Hanks role and play himself in a movie.", "created_utc": 1517256932.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1517270352.0, "id": "dtff9gf", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7tudsh", "parent_id": "t1_dtfa2jk", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7tudsh/tom_hanks_to_play_mr_rogers_in_you_are_my_friend/dtff9gf/", "score": 22, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "ArcadeNational", "author_id": "af589", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": ">Nice guy plays *THE NICEST GUY*.\n\n*FTFY*", "created_utc": 1517257184.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dtffj5h", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7tudsh", "parent_id": "t1_dtfbewn", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7tudsh/tom_hanks_to_play_mr_rogers_in_you_are_my_friend/dtffj5h/", "score": 89, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "RandomStrategy", "author_id": "h199w", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "John Cena as John Cena?", "created_utc": 1517257270.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dtffmir", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7tudsh", "parent_id": "t1_dtfaka7", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7tudsh/tom_hanks_to_play_mr_rogers_in_you_are_my_friend/dtffmir/", "score": 89, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "RandomStrategy", "author_id": "h199w", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I hope that they don't have a scene of Tom Hanks as Mr. Rogers peeing somewhere.", "created_utc": 1517257230.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dtffkz1", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7tudsh", "parent_id": "t1_dtfb315", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7tudsh/tom_hanks_to_play_mr_rogers_in_you_are_my_friend/dtffkz1/", "score": 47, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "RandomStrategy", "author_id": "h199w", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Fecal matter reduction, served chilled with steel-cut plant shavings (50)", "created_utc": 1517251375.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dtf9b3d", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7tudsh", "parent_id": "t1_dtf925k", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7tudsh/tom_hanks_to_play_mr_rogers_in_you_are_my_friend/dtf9b3d/", "score": 240, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "tomservo88", "author_id": "hc95s", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "he should probably lose a few pounds for the role though ", "created_utc": 1517255833.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dtfe3dq", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7tudsh", "parent_id": "t1_dtf925k", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7tudsh/tom_hanks_to_play_mr_rogers_in_you_are_my_friend/dtfe3dq/", "score": 18, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Rudi_Reifenstecher", "author_id": "clr6m", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Norton would have been good.

Or maybe, if the truth be told, Mister Rogers went into battle against a little boy with a big sword, for Mister Rogers didn't\u00a0like\u00a0the big sword. It was one of those swords that really isn't a sword at all; it was a big plastic contraption with lights and sound effects, and it was the kind of sword used in defense of the universe by the heroes of the television shows that the little boy liked to watch. The little boy with the big sword did not watch Mister Rogers. In fact, the little boy with the big sword didn't know who Mister Rogers\u00a0was, and so when Mister Rogers knelt down in front of him, the little boy with the big sword looked past him and through him, and when Mister Rogers said, \"Oh, my, that's a big sword you have,\" the boy didn't answer, and finally his mother got embarrassed and said, \"Oh, honey, c'mon, that's\u00a0Mister Rogers,\" and felt his head for fever. Of course, she knew who Mister Rogers was, because she had grown up with him, and she knew that he was good for her son, and so now, with her little boy zombie-eyed under his blond bangs, she apologized, saying to Mister Rogers that she knew he was in a rush and that she knew he was here in Penn Station taping his program and that her son usually wasn't\u00a0like\u00a0this, he was probably just tired\u2026. Except that Mister Rogers wasn't going anywhere. Yes, sure, he was taping, and right there, in Penn Station in New York City, were rings of other children wiggling in wait for him, but right now his patient gray eyes were fixed on the little boy with the big sword, and so he stayed there, on one knee, until the little boy's eyes finally focused on Mister Rogers, and he said, \"It's not a sword; it's a death ray.\" A death ray! Oh, honey, Mommy\u00a0knewyou could do it\u2026.And so now, encouraged, Mommy said, \"Do you want to give Mister Rogers a hug, honey?\" But the boy was shaking his head no, and Mister Rogers was sneaking his face past the big sword and the armor of the little boy's eyes and whispering something in his ear\u2014something that, while not changing his mind about the hug, made the little boy look at Mister Rogers in a new way, with the eyes of a child at last, and nod his head yes.\n\n>We were heading back to his apartment in a taxi when I asked him what he had said.\n\n>\"Oh, I just knew that whenever you see a little boy carrying something like that, it means that he wants to show people that he's strong on the outside.

Mister Rogers didn't leave, though. He wanted something from the boy, and Mister Rogers never leaves when he wants something from somebody. He just waited patiently, and when the boy came back, Mister Rogers talked to him, and then he made his request. He said, \"I would like you to do something for me. Would you do something for me?\" On his computer, the boy answered yes, of course, he would do anything for Mister Rogers, so then Mister Rogers said, \"I would like you to pray for me. Will you pray for me?\" And now the boy didn't know how to respond. He was thunderstruck. Thunderstruck means that you can't talk, because something has happened that's as sudden and as miraculous and maybe as scary as a bolt of lightning, and all you can do is listen to the rumble. The boy was thunderstruck because nobody had ever asked him for something like that, ever. The boy had always been prayed for. The boy had always been the object of prayer, and now he was being asked to pray for Mister Rogers, and although at first he didn't know if he could do it, he said he would, he said he'd try, and **ever since then he keeps Mister Rogers in his prayers and doesn't talk about wanting to die anymore, because he figures Mister Rogers is close to God, and if Mister Rogers likes him, that must mean God likes him, too.**", "created_utc": 1517276698.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dtfyw6i", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7tudsh", "parent_id": "t1_dtfmjxh", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7tudsh/tom_hanks_to_play_mr_rogers_in_you_are_my_friend/dtfyw6i/", "score": 16, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "ACanticle4Needledick", "author_id": "ucb036y", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Try to love everyone you meet tomorrow.
