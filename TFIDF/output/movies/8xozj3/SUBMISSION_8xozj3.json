It a great story.  Plenty of drama and a happy ending.  It writes itself.  My request is make it more like Touching The Void, https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0379557/ and less like a made for tv docudrama that has every ones heads shaking.  Like Touching The Void, get the actual coach, kids, rescue divers, and any one else willing to talk.  I assume most of the kids may be too traumatized to interview, which is understandable, but get the rescuers, it would be amazing to hear their accounts of the operation.  I'm just saying treat it with respect, it could be amazing.  What do you guys predict?\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "title": "Now that the whole Thai soccer team and coach are all saved, you know they'll make a movie of it.", "url": null, "author_name": "Graphic-Addiction", "author_id": "yl7bw", "subreddit_name": "movies", "upvote_ratio": 0.8}
