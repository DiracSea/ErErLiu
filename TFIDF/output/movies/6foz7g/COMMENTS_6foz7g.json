While the consumers are mainly railing about fidelity to the original theatrical run and the jarring interruption caused by \"bleeps\" or phonetically similar words overdubbed on the soundtrack, artists are pushing back against changes that interfere with their work and how it is viewed, and thus, reflects on them.\n\nLong before the MPAA rating system, entire works were riddled with holes reminiscent of Swiss cheese once the censorship board got their hands on them. Nor did the censorship board use consistent, predictable standards. Today's network broadcast self-imposed Standards and Practices attempt to keep their clients on the safe side of the FCC's rather vague language and theme guidelines. In short, they keep costs down because they help avoid fines to their employers. But once it's out on the airwaves, it's a finished product, either bleeped or not.\n\nWhen a producer/director/writer creates a movie, they create it as they've produced it, and then submit it for assessment for ratings. In doing so, it completely removes the possibility of work being diluted or even black balled due to content. It merely gets an appropriate rating, and the viewing public get to decide to view or not as they see fit.\n\nAirlines and cable are a special case, as was videos in the 80s and 90s. But since the margins on those were much smaller for the artists and bigger for the distributors, plus were much delayed compared to the theatrical showing, most artists cared less.\n\nNow going in with the expectation of producing a \"clean\" version (i.e., PG-13) in parallel with an unretouched version of the original piece for \"marketability reasons\" looks like a slippery slope back into censorship. Most would rather stop creating than be limited in their creativity and expression.\n\nPersonally, I'm fine with the MPAA system and wish there were a more objective system applied to both network and cable television.\n\nI'm embarrassed for American culture and the grip of the religious, moral extremists every time I watch a movie on a *Monday to Friday plane*.", "created_utc": 1496799047.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1496841151.0, "id": "dik5ka2", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6foz7g", "parent_id": "t1_dijvy06", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6foz7g/seth_rogen_criticizes_sonys_plan_to_release_clean/dik5ka2/", "score": 8, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "macblastoff", "author_id": "7kj8j", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "This is what happens when you find a stranger in the Alps!", "created_utc": 1496794745.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dik28eg", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6foz7g", "parent_id": "t1_dijvy06", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6foz7g/seth_rogen_criticizes_sonys_plan_to_release_clean/dik28eg/", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Kapjak", "author_id": "qwzmq", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Savage.", "created_utc": 1496813951.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dikfdvw", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6foz7g", "parent_id": "t1_dik6cnp", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6foz7g/seth_rogen_criticizes_sonys_plan_to_release_clean/dikfdvw/", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "craftinmymine", "author_id": "9otlw", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Poney?", "created_utc": 1496811286.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dikdymn", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6foz7g", "parent_id": "t1_dik55ca", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6foz7g/seth_rogen_criticizes_sonys_plan_to_release_clean/dikdymn/", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "bugdog", "author_id": "3z3sw", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "More relevant, they've done it with movies for decades for TV.
