I mean the show isn't Sopranos-level quality, it's got flaws that are certainly worth criticising, but you'd think it was unwatchable, putrid shit if you went by the response of r/television.\n\nReddit is too ~~subseptible~~ susceptible to hype and contrariness to get honest responses to big brands/franchises like DC and Marvel, in my opinion.", "created_utc": 1503253132.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1503259064.0, "id": "dlw250j", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6uwh5t", "parent_id": "t1_dlvz97t", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6uwh5t/wonder_woman_has_just_passed_the_original/dlw250j/", "score": 35, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "dicedaman", "author_id": "6ggt9", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Circle of entire Reddit if anything.

It would have been better if she'd actually seen the futility of an attack first, really play up the \"war is hell\" aspect for the mere mortals, then show her leading an attack which succeeds. You still get the cool \"all ~~eyes~~ guns on me\" scene for the trailer, but you also get a bit more chance for character development. In fact, having her run out the first time, which inspires a charge that gets everyone else killed would be interesting, and give the film a way to break the \"godlike skills but completely naive\" air she never really lost, whilst also letting her know that whilst she might be nigh-unstoppable, the men around her aren't.\n\nSecond, the sidekicks really felt like there was supposed to be more to but we got barely anything and then they were left behind. Diana apparently cares deeply for all of them but she spends about two days with them, all told. There's such a varied cast, from the sniper who can't shoot to \"the indian\" who's apparently something like the Milo Minderbinder of WW1. We get that everyone is happy to see him, but we never get *why*.\n\nThen there's the village. I literally didn't care that the germans exterminated them with poison gas. It just had no emotional weight, and Diana running off back to the village just fed into that naive feeling rather than the \"devastating loss\" that I think it was supposed to make me feel.\n\nThroughout the film, I also felt that they never really established what her abilities and strengths were, so everything she does seems to be a deus ex machina for the sake of it - being able to jump a long way is fine, and using it later was a great plot point. Not being even slightly affected by the deadliest poison gas the God of War could invent (and that gas just making Chris Pine cough)? Where did that come from?\n\nThe ending was also a bit... yeah.\n\nActually, come to think of it the beginning didn't exactly start out too well either. It was pretty slow, and the museum scene would have been better as an ending scene to tie it into the Justice League. Frankly I'm not sure whether that would be much better, since no matter what they do with it it's going to remind me that BvS exists.

In addition to this, they STILL kept the weapon upgrade system...despite the fact that the player can only carry two weapons. Not to mention that the gun models don't even change when you upgrade them which was half the dang excitement of getting an upgrade in the last two games.\n\nAdditionally, the player can no longer carry and manage any health or salts (eve), with the player depending completely on Elizabeth for any or finding them in throughout the environment.\n\nHonestly, A LOT of the problems seem to stem from Elizabeth in order to make her SEEM more useful.\n\nShe helps provide the player with...\n\n* Health\n* Salts\n* Ammunition\n* Money\n\nIt feels like the developers, in order to make Elizabeth feel more helpful, removed a lot of gameplay systems and mechanics in order to make the player more dependent on her.\n\nIt would also explain why the player cannot carry as many weapons as the last few games. If the player was able to carry 12 guns, when would they EVER need Elizabeth to throw them more? In fact, they even FIX this problem in the DLC, as the player CAN carry more than 2 weapons, but simply has vastly less ammunition for each weapon.\n\nAs for Health and Salts, it seems like they just took away the ability for the player to carry either, which...is kinda frustrating, since it just seems blatantly obvious they did it in order to make Elizabeth seem more helpful.\n\nNot to mention that Elizabeth just becomes invisible during combat. Even during the final fight. In which the Vox EXPLICTLY tells us that they're going to kill The Lamb (Elizabeth), but they still just run past her.\n\nBioshock: Infinite has great art direction, amazing voice acting, and some pretty cool set pieces and environments.\n\nBut, the gameplay is boring and the story is convoluted.", "created_utc": 1503254523.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dlw384o", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6uwh5t", "parent_id": "t1_dlw0xtc", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6uwh5t/wonder_woman_has_just_passed_the_original/dlw384o/", "score": 14, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Flamma_Man", "author_id": "68vvk", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Infinite is considered by a lot of long-time fans of Bio/System Shock to be considerably dumbed down from the previous games.\n\nYou can only have two weapons at once, they removed the survival elements, gears are an absolutely shite replacement for tonics/implants, and vigors are crazy limited.\n\nYou don't get as many of those cool Shock moments anymore. In BioShock, there'd be those tense moments when you're pottering around with almost no bullets left, and the game gets real tense, or you figure out a cool plasmid weapon combo. In Infinite, ammo is no object unless you're using a rocket launcher type weapon. Vigors are definitely creative powers, but they're also very controlled, so you don't get as much fun. Also, tears feel underutilized.\n\nThe upgrade system sucks balls. So in System Shock, you had a decent Cyber Module system, where you allocate points for increasingly higher costs into stats and weapon skills, and it was good, but a bit boring. In BioShock, you've got the ADAM system, which is again alright, but the gap in ADAM stashes from saving vs harvesting is too small to be compelling. Infinite says \"Fuck all of that, now you buy upgrades with money, and they suck, and you lose money for dying, so the worse you do the less you get.\" The upgrade system also ruined most players experience with the Vox weapons, since you'll have all your points in other weapons once you get them.\n\nThe story, you've got two different stories going on here. There's the racist Columbia stuff, and you've got the interdimensional stuff. Columbia sucks compared to Rapture. In Rapture, everyone had a point of view, and every character was their own personal tragedy. The worst characters in that game were probably Suchong and Fontaine, because they were cardboard cut out villains. In Columbia, EVERYBODY is Suchong and Fontaine. Fink sucks. The Lutece twins suck. Slate fucking SUUUUCKS. They could have been more interesting, especially in the case of Slate, but they're done as the archetypal Factory owner, Quirky time traveler, and Psychopath.\n\nThe racism is aspect is done very poorly. With a game portraying a world in the style of industrializing America, they had an awesome chance to explore the causes of racism, how it twists people. Infinite's portrayal of racism is awful. What's the message the game is trying to send? \"Racism is bad?\" It's the most obvious, moralizing way of doing it possible. I THOUGHT there was going to be something with Comstock, with how they set him up to be a master manipulator using racism as an excuse to make his own personal world, but no! He's just fucking insane!\n\nWorld building stinks. There's definitely a bigger focus on what looked cool than what made sense. I was very excited to learn about the Handymen and the Firemen and the Crows, but halfway through the game, all of that is thrown out so the game can focus on the interdimensional time travel plot.\n\nThe interdimensional plot was the best part of the story. It could have been explored a bit better, but for what it is, it's poignant, thought provoking, and open ended in the best way.\n\nBurial at Sea fucked the ending in the arsehole. I won't get into it too big right now, but it ruined the ambiguity and tried too hard to clear up the connections. I LIKED the vague connections between Columbia and Rapture, the parallels between Comstock and Ryan, and Burial ruined that.\n\nThere's still a lot of great stuff about the game. It's still a blast to play, it still has an entertaining story overall, it's beautiful in a way that can't age, and it's still one of the best seventh gen games, and better than most games overall.

In an earlier sequence, the Joker's threat to blow up a hospital if that reporter guy isn't dead in 60 minutes has the masses shooting at his police escort, and a guy who nearly flattens his vehicle, saved only by the timely interception of Bruce Wayne's Lamborghini.
