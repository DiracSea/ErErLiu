Too bad Winter Soldier's poster was nowhere as good as the actual film.

I'm sure Black Panther's success with the large audience it gained from many people not invested in the MCU movies also helped for sure, knowing that he would be back in another movie (the Avengers, no less which is a name almost everyone knows at this point) just 2 months after his own movie, and Wakanda with him no less (that part more from trailers than the poster though.)\n\nBut yeah Avengers 4 could totally have a cooler poster with less faces (and that's guaranteed ;) rip) because Infinity War was such a success, the next movie is expected to do just as good if not even better.\n\nWant to add the Spider-Man Homecoming poster was probably by far the *worst*, especially compared to the other poster they made with him in the suit and jacket with the Avengers tower in the background.... an obvious and very stupid choice, but surprise!
