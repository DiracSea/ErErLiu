Vin Diesel is the eldest brother despite being the shortest of the physically impressive 3. Terry is the middle one and the Rock is the youngest. The movie opens with them helping out in their parents Chinese restaurant, Vin Diesel is manning the wok, Terry is chopping up vegetables and meat with a cleaver like a pro and the Rock is hosting and waiting on tables.\n\nThe restaurant has seen better days and the brothers are struggling to find out how to keep it afloat when a gang of Triads come in and try to extort their parents for \"protection\" money. The brothers have been raised humbly by their Chinese parents but when one of the Triad gangsters takes out a knife and walks towards their mother, Terry throws his cleaver in to the Triad's back, killing him. We learn this gangster was the Triad leader's younger brother, and he vows to exact revenge.\n\nThe 3 brothers who are not trained fighters must figure out how to combat the Triad while simultaneously saving the restaurant. During their blundering encounters where they fight the Triads, certain fight scenes and action moments inspire the brothers with new recipes, like when a Triad throws a grenade and a Steamed Pork Bun (Char Siu Bao) cart explodes. Browned pieces of the buns land in one of the Triad's bowl of tonkotsu ramen broth that he was eating before the fight. The little browned pork buns with the broth give Terry the idea to make a hearty tonkotsu soup with Char Siu Bao dumplings.\n\nThe brothers fight to defeat the Triads and along the way get inspired with enough recipe ideas to turn their parents restaurant in to one of the most popular Michelin Star Asian Fusion restaurants in China.", "created_utc": 1520318042.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1520370806.0, "id": "dv9765t", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8283lt", "parent_id": "t1_dv8h6d4", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8283lt/the_lonely_island_were_asked_to_write_a_song_for/dv9765t/", "score": 415, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I got you even better.
