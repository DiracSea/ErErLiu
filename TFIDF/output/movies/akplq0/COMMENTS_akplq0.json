[{"body": "Official Toy Story 4 synopsis:\n\n\u201cWoody (voice of Tom Hanks) has always been confident about his place in the world, and that his priority is taking care of his kid, whether that\u2019s Andy or Bonnie. So when Bonnie\u2019s beloved new craft-project-turned-toy, Forky (voice of Tony Hale), declares himself as \u201ctrash\u201d and not a toy, Woody takes it upon himself to show Forky why he should embrace being a toy. But when Bonnie takes the whole gang on her family\u2019s road trip excursion, Woody ends up on an unexpected detour that includes a reunion with his long-lost friend Bo Peep (voice of Annie Potts). After years of being on her own, Bo\u2019s adventurous spirit and life on the road belie her delicate porcelain exterior. As Woody and Bo realize they\u2019re worlds apart when it comes to life as a toy, they soon come to find that\u2019s the least of their worries. \u201c\n\n\n[Source](https://lrmonline.com/news/toy-story-4-bo-peep-is-back-in-new-teaser-and-poster-new-synopsis-revealed/)", "created_utc": 1548697115.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "ef6sgaq", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_akplq0", "parent_id": "t3_akplq0", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/akplq0/toy_story_4_official_bo_peep_poster/ef6sgaq/", "score": 5926, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "TooShiftyForYou", "author_id": "p30w3", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I'm glad they're closing the loop on Bo Beep.

But it was just his voice, he sounded much the same talking day to day as he did when voicing anything. \n\nBut from the New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh onwards, so 1980s, it was voiced by another Disney veteran voice actor, Jim Cummings. And the voice is a dead ringer. That guy also voiced Razoul the guard in Aladdin, and took over from Jeremy Irons to play Scar for the final verse of Be Prepared in The Lion King, because Irons' voice was shot.
