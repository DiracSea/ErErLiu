Our protagonist, John, develops a hate for the society that created his life in John Wick 1 &amp; 2. Then, in Constantine, John carries out with his final efforts of defiance in order to see his beloved in the afterlife. All of the other characters referring to him as \u201cJohn\u201d goes a very long way in creating this fun continuity, but it\u2019s Keanu\u2019s cold and calculated demeanor that makes Constantine feel like a sequel in a series about our protagonist. In addition, John develops a quasi-romance with a new woman, though it never actually goes anywhere. In the John Wick series, that would have been ridiculous. But as a contiguous story about our pal John, it actually fits the narrative. I encourage anyone who enjoys either of those films to approach them as a series, it will create some genuinely entertaining continuity.
