They made it sound like the meteor hit a very long time ago, like during the bronze age at the latest... how are they mining and refining vibranium with primitive tools and *very* limited metallurgy knowledge?  Did the vibranium also give them magical knowledge on how to refine it?\n\nWhat does a Wakandan's daily life look like?  What's their *actual* system of governance beyond the \"king and a stereotypical representative of major African cultures past and present\" government?  What's their educational system like?  What's their healthcare look like, since vibranium appears to be outright magical?\n\nThere are so many unanswered questions and frankly Wakanda was the only interesting thing about Black Panther.  The only reason I can see Black Panther being so much more successful than arguably superior Marvel movies is *because* it features a black hero, an almost entirely black cast (any non-black characters are bit roles and secondary to the black protagonists, in a reversal of usual Hollywood setups) and ham-fistedly talks about issues the black community has faced and continues to face.\n\nDid you ever stop and think that maybe \"It DiD gOod cAUse mUh ViRTue SiGNallInG & WHite GUilt\" is a common expression because it's difficult to provide any other explanation for why it did so much better than other Marvel movies despite not having a narrative or acting that's substantially better or even *different* from other Marvel movies?", "created_utc": 1533423565.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e3m8u59", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_94l5ne", "parent_id": "t1_e3lybdc", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/94l5ne/black_panther_crosses_700m_in_us_almost_six/e3m8u59/", "score": 41, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "CBSh61340", "author_id": "1kdnvtw2", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Why change?

I didn't HATE it, it's just mindboggling how so many people can be praising it.\nWhile Michael B Jordan did a pretty good job with what he was given, the character arc was extremely rushed and just became plain stupid towards the end with his completely absurd plan.  \n\n[I feel like the pacing of the entire movie was off, mainly because they spent half the movie chasing Andy Serkis' character. When we finally get to what's supposed to be the focus of the movie it all has to play out in an incredibly rushed fashion with Killmonger taking over the kingdom, disposing of the Black Panther and then getting into his silly plan of taking over the world all within a day or two.  \nIf all of that had taken up the majority of the movie and taken months or possibly even years in movie-time, it would have seemed a lot more plausible and less silly.  \nI honestly think they could have fixed most of the issues with the movie by heavily reducing the first \"pre-Wakanda\" portion of the movie and extended the part with Killmonger coming to Wakanda. It feels like there's almost no time to flesh out the characters in the latter part of the movie and everything happens too quickly and there's no time to linger on anything, every little thing is there to move the story along and most of the characters are making extremely drastic and unbelievable actions with almost no hesitation because the story dictates it, rather than because it seems like something they would actually do.](#spoiler)\n\nThere are a ton of nitpicky things I can think of, but won't really get into. Like you said there are plenty of other mediocre blockbusters that make tons of money, but usually they aren't showered in as much praise as this movie was.  \n\nAll in all it was a pretty ordinary Hollywood action movie, and I completely agree that me and others are being more harsh on the movie than we probably normally would be, but I think it's pretty cheap to just instinctively call the racist card because we're pointing out that the movie really isn't as fantastic as it was initially made out to be.", "created_utc": 1533429613.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1533430022.0, "id": "e3meewa", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_94l5ne", "parent_id": "t1_e3m7vjw", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/94l5ne/black_panther_crosses_700m_in_us_almost_six/e3meewa/", "score": 10, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Fyller", "author_id": "99eib", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Well how about this.
