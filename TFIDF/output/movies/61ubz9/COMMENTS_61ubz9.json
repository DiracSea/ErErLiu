But she was happy, like a warrior woman after a battle taking a moment to relax, but a friend of mine got accusing at me for drawing a woman in such a manner.

I'm rambling, dont know the point, because I haven't figured it out yet, but I really love the new Lara Croft especially because it is Lara Croft.

I wish people would stop using this argument. Length of a book doesn't matter. What matters is how it's written. Tolkien's writing style for The Hobbit is completely different to the one he used for Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit is a vey quickly paced book with a lot of action and story being quickly summed up in a few sentences. In Lord of the Rings, Tolkien took a more leisurely detailed style. This is because he aimed the books at different audiences; The Hobbit is a children's book and so doesn't linger on things children may find boring and moves quickly on to the next action sequence. To make it simple; it takes half of Fellowship of the Ring for Frodo to reach Rivendell whereas Bilbo reaches it in less than three chapters. \n\nThere's more to a book than it's length. Authors use different styles for different books, so saying The Hobbit should be one movie because it's a shorter book doesn't quite work because it's written in a completely different style to Lord of the Rings. Yes, there's enough length for one film but there's too much story for one 2-2.5 hour film. At least a properly paced one at any rate.
