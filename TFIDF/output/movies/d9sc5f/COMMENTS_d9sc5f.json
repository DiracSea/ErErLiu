That said, I can understand people preferring the second.\n\nTerminator 2 is certainly good.  But the first time I saw either movie, I watched them back-to-back on the same day, and it was 100% evident to me that the first movie was much better.  It was much more intense, had a darker atmosphere, and just had more of an identity IMO.  Terminator 2 felt and looked like good, but fairly generic, action.  The Terminator looked, sounded, and felt like an absolute and unrelenting nightmare with no escape.  There was humor, but there were no heartwarming E.T. scenes between John Connor and the Terminator.  It was just cold and kind of hopeless.\n\nAgain, the first time I watched both movies, it was T1 to T2, the same day.  Maybe if I had seen T2 years after the first or something I would have felt differently.  But I will never understand what is better about T2.  It's good, but on my first watch, I just left baffled at how it's universally regarded as superior.
