[{"body": "**Films not on follow list with udpates**\n\n* **Deadpool 2 \\-** Despite the film having more room to have a softer second weekend landing with Solo underperforming, the comic book comedy film still had a rough second weekend dropping 66&#37; to come in a #2 with $42.7M. In comparison Deadpool dropped 57.4&#37; for its second and earned $56.4M domestic. This goes along with Deadpool 2's disappointing Sunday returns last weekend to suggest that there might be a growing disinterest and lack of specialness to the franchise. Still the film is about to crack $500M worldwide so not in dire straits, just odd that it doesn't seem to be having that same verve as the original.

And I guess it was a smart move, because *Solo*'s numbers might've been even smaller with *Infinity War* closer.\n\nI remember in early January practically every thread here was saying that *Solo* would be moved to June, July or August, or pushed back even further down to December. Yet, they kept firm with the May release. \n\nAnd then the teaser came and didn't win the audience. (It's not even in the [most viewed trailer in 24 hours list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_viewed_online_trailers_in_the_first_24_hours)). So it got a little better by having *Infinity War* a little further away, but still, there's so much else at play that didn't work marketing wise. (It's a shame. I liked the movie and admire Howard for stitching up a mess). Marketing wise you had:\n\n- Production issues (Lord & Miller fired, reshooting with Ron Howard)\n- Not enough star power in the main lead. The marketing hook is more in the brand name and iconic Millenium Falcon, Chewbacca, Lando. (Even though Emilia Clarke and Donald Glover certainly could help to gain audience through their star power, even though they are not the main lead).\n- No marketing until after *The Last Jedi* has played out. I guess I can see why they did it, but I am not sure if it turned out great.\n- The teaser/trailer didn't wow and a lot of the criticism was geared around Alden not sounding like Harrison Ford. (Which isn't, in my opinion, any problem in the movie. This was Alden's portrayal of Han Solo. Not Alden's portrayal of Harrison Ford. My problems with the movie had nothing to do with Han Solo actually).\n- Movie poster was plagiarized\n- Bad date for the premiere weekend. Probably not realizing how much *Deadpool 2* would draw as an audience.\n\n^EDIT: ^Edited ^star ^power ^bullet ^point\n", "created_utc": 1527521818.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1527540548.0, "id": "dzpn921", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8mqc9u", "parent_id": "t1_dzpix1g", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8mqc9u/box_office_week_solo_a_star_wars_story_debuts_at/dzpn921/", "score": 313, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Choekaas", "author_id": "8swl1", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I don't think Infinity War was ever really part of the battle tbh.
