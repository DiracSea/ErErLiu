But knowing that he likes to delve into the human psyche and psychology, most notably the ideas of what composes the human being and their experience, I believe that he\u2019s creating a \u201cseries\u201d of films, each one going slightly deeper than the last. \n\n\u201cGet Out\u201d was a dialogue about the situations, mindsets and opinions of others that shape the African American experience in America. I believe that this insert of the \u201cseries\u201d is exploring how those same elements affect the actual psychology and spiritual make up of black people, dealing specifically with the idea of creating the \u201cself\u201d, which effects the perspective(s) with which those experiences are had and the choices that may result. \n\nSo it\u2019s not about race per say but about identify.... of which race is merely an attribute. Rather than narrowing down, he seems to be blossoming out and expanding on ideas he\u2019s previously presented in \u201cGet Out\u201d. Getting deeper. \n\nHe asked Lupita to watch several films before filming. What stood out to me is that a few of those films were created by two masters of symbolism; M. Night Shyamalan, and Stanley Kurbrick. One of the films, \u201cThe Sixth Sense\u201d by M. Night uses color (Red) to convey specific messages about the human experience to the audience. Kubrick often uses color but in \u201cThe Shining\u201d he uses ambiguous language and historical references to convey messages, often about human absurdity and our own self perceived supremacy which is actually hubris created by ignorance. \n\nJust in the trailer, I\u2019ve noticed Peele\u2019s use of color and symbols to give us an idea of what I think his message may be:\n\nCOLORS:\n\nBeige/White/Tan: These colors often seen on the same spectrum represent purity, innocence, goodness... Lupita is seen wearing a white hat as she teaches her son to stay on \u201cbeat\u201d, the car seats are beige, Jason is wearing a white t-shirt. In addition to white representing \u201cgoodness\u201d, in America it represents conformity... blandness, acceptance. It is also a color that \u201creflects\u201d light. (I\u2019ll come back to that.)\n\nRed: Red represents passion, aggression, anger, willpower, it commands attention. In African culture it also represents death/mourning/sadness. The \u201ctethered\u201d are seen donned in red cloaks. \n\nGold: The scissors welded by the \u201ctethered\u201d are gold. Gold represents what is precious, riches, warmness, wealth, the sun... \n\nNotes: The \u201ctethered\u201d  hold the scissors close to their chest... in casket position. Representing a spiritual death maybe. \n\nOTHER SYMBOLS:\n\nFire and Water: We see the family arrived at the beach with an overhead shot of them walking with the water above them. Whenever we see the \u201ctethered\u201d in the trailer there is usually fire accompanying them in some way. Both water and fire are elements; formidable and powerful in their own respects. Fire with the ability to engulf and consume. Water though can extinguish and essentially \u201csmother\u201d fire. \n\nWhite Rabbit: We see white rabbits caged in one scene of the trailer and a black rabbit among them. When Peele tweeted the trailer, he said \u201cwatch yourself\u201d. Jefferson Airplane has a song called \u201cWhite Rabbit\u201d which is essential the story of Alice in Wonderland. There is one line that reminds Alice to \u201ckeep her head\u201d. Meaning... don\u2019t lose yourself. \n\nBallerina: We see two ballerinas in the trailer. The \u201ctethered\u201d ballerina and the natural ballerina both donned in a white dress and tutu. No distinction other than the crowd versus the silence. \n\nPUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER::\n\nI believe that in some aspects, \u201cUs\u201d is a nod to W.E.B. DuBois\u2019 \u201cThe Souls of Black Folks\u201d wherein he discussed the perceived \u201cwhitewashing\u201d\u2019/conformity of African Americans as a means of survival and ascension in America, thus creating \u201cgood\u201d (souls) people at the cost of sacrificing the pure \u201csoul\u201d. The soul in an of itself is often referred to as the light that is contained in each of us which is the nucleus for who we truly are as well as a guide to who we continue to become; the light which is emitted to others as a means of identification. The soul is also often likened to a \u201cfire\u201d (which is also a light). The soul is also seen as a \u201crhythm\u201d which may explain why Jason is not \u201con beat\u201d as he lacks that soul connection. \n\nFrom the beginning we see the Wilson family embracing white/beige or a more colorless cultural identity through their apparel, car etc. Being a reflector rather than an absorber of light, white repels their true self or their soul which essentially creates the outer body presence of the \u201ctethered\u201d. Even in the willful denial of the self, it will always exist and be connected;  thus be \u201ctethered\u201d even if only in extension. \n\nThe \u201ctethered\u201d are seen as evil because those aspects of the self, which they willfully try to deny, are seen in larger society as undesirable/unwanted... even monstrous/destructive. \n\nArriving at the beach, the water with the waves seen overhead in the shot but shadows still in tow is another way in which the Wilsons make attempts to distinguish their self/soul but can\u2019t fully detach because again one can\u2019t deny their truest self. \n\nThe \u201ctethered\u201d are seen with fire emitting in the darknesses. Peele and Lupita\u2019s \u201ctethered\u201d remind us to \u201cwatch yourself\u201d. Watching being a willful action requiring attention to an identified subject, in this case the self. In order to watch, one must be aware... awake. \n\nJason\u2019s \u201ctethered\u201d has a mouth that is covered; him being the youngest Wilson and likely the most detached would likely have his \u201csoul\u201d voice or true voice quashed the earliest in life which could also represent why he in the physical wears a mask to literally hide and in the \u201ctethered\u201d wears a complete white complete head covering... white face? \n\nBallerinas are seen as the pinnacle of white femininity, grace and beauty. To see a black ballerina is almost a nod to the desire to truly break barriers (see Misty Copeland). Still in all both the \u201ctethered\u201d and physical ballerinas wear white referencing the deflection of light again. Additionally ballerinas are seen in music boxes... comfortably contained, spinning round and round to no where like hamsters in a wheel controlled by merely closing the box, leaving the ballerina with not ability to \u201cstep outside\u201d of the box. \n\nThe scissors represent the paradox. The struggle to dismiss the self but the scissors being gold, precious... suggest that the choice is not easy or wise as there is much to lose... so much to lose that the choice in and of itself could drive one to completely fail to exist spiritually and psychologically... which leads to the purest form of madness. Lacking identify and thus even a sense of life purpose... death. \n\nJust my theory... \n\n ", "created_utc": 1545796936.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "ecke13p", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_a9f1z9", "parent_id": "t3_a9f1z9", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/a9f1z9/us_official_trailer_hd/ecke13p/", "score": 36, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "AndiiRYouThere", "author_id": "2uxocoe4", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "What the fuck is wrong with Jordan Peele?", "created_utc": 1545769173.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "ecjfcy9", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_a9f1z9", "parent_id": "t3_a9f1z9", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/a9f1z9/us_official_trailer_hd/ecjfcy9/", "score": 13, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "CaptainGrayson", "author_id": "11wqt3", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Early on in the trailer she tells her son to \"stick with her and hell be safe\" or something to that effect.

Regardless of which family is the \u201creal\u201d one, that would add to the conflict and could still make what I said before the edit true.\n\nEdit 2: Another possibility is that the car scene really is the ending, and not a happy one (if the original family turns out to be the creepy one).\n\nThe theory: \u201creal\u201d family gets taken, cloned by the government, or some other shady organization (lab with rabbits is an indication of cloning experiments). Boy gets disfigured in the process. New, \u201cother\u201d family takes their place, after its members have their memories replaced. Original family escapes, comes back to reclaim their spot and eliminate the clones. Not an unusual plot for Jordan Peele (Get Out had similar sci-fi vibes).\n\nIf the car scene is the ending, it means they have failed.
