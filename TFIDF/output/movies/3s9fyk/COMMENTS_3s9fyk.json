Within 5 minutes of walking out of the theatre conversation mostly revolved around which character was worse: young 'Annie' or Jar Jar.  To this day I maintain that Annie ruined the movie even more than Jar Jar did but time has proven mine to be the minority view.  In any case, the hype wore off on us pretty darn quick.  I haven't even bothered to rewatch it since then.  I did watch the other movies (Anakin was still annoying as fuck but Jar Jar was mostly phased out) and was disappointed by them though less so because the first movie had already killed my hype.

And the ride goes up and down and round and round and it has thrills and chills and it's very brightly colored and it's very loud. And it's fun, for a while. \n\nSome people have been on the ride for a long time, and they begin to question: 'Is this real? Or is this just a ride?' And other people have remembered, and they come back to us and they say 'Hey! Don't worry, don't be afraid -- ever -- because... this is just a ride.' And we kill those people. \n\n'Shut him up! We have a lot invested in this ride! Shut him up! Look at my furrows of worry; look at my big bank account, and my family. This has to be real.' It's just a ride. But we always kill those good guys who try and tell us that -- ever notice that? -- and we let the demons run amok. But it doesn't matter, because... it's just a ride, and we can change it any time we want. It's only a choice. No effort. No worry. No job. No savings and money. Just a choice, right now, between fear and love. The eyes of fear want you to put bigger locks on your door, buy bigger guns, close yourself off. The eyes of love, instead, see all of us as one. \n\nHere's what we can do to change the world, right now, into a better ride. Take all that money we spend on weapons and defense each year and, instead, spend it feeding, clothing and educating the poor of the world, which it would do many times over -- not one human being excluded -- and we can explore space together, both inner and outer, forever. In peace.\"\n\n~ Bill Hicks", "created_utc": 1447164476.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "cwvaqds", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_3s9fyk", "parent_id": "t1_cwvamkc", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/3s9fyk/star_wars_superfan_daniel_fleetwood_dies_days/cwvaqds/", "score": 97, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "DirectlyDisturbed", "author_id": "j92we", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "If you consider how massive and old our universe is, how old our own planet is and think about how little our 80 or so years of life is on the grand timeline of everything...

Before even seeing Phantom Menace in the theaters, I was already a fan of his work in Shallow Grave and Trainspotting, and I enjoyed him in films like Moulin Rouge, Big Fish, Ghost Writer...films where he's generally able to strut his stuff. I also LOVE him in the reality series Long Way Round, and Long Way Down (though I think he should have stood up to his wife a bit in that later one), but the Star Wars films just really hampered what he was capable of (as it did all of the top talent on board). So, for instance, I didn't think his performance was any better than, say, Christopher Lee's, and really, if I had to pick the greatest performance in the series it was Ian McDiarmid's, and not because he's necessarily a better actor, but because he was given some of the best lines, and made the best out of them.", "created_utc": 1447167181.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "cwvc3ha", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_3s9fyk", "parent_id": "t1_cwvb64g", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/3s9fyk/star_wars_superfan_daniel_fleetwood_dies_days/cwvc3ha/", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "adrift98", "author_id": "4a4pu", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Natalie Portman's performance was totally due to terrible dialogue and even worse direction.
