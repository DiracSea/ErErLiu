I love him more than anything and we have been together for 4 years. We work a busy schedule so we probably have sex once a week. He has never said no to any of my fetish requests and its great. He has one request for me though and that is roleplaying. He loves it and after all hes done for me, it seems like an easy thing to do considering he's never asked me for anything else.\n\nHe just takes it so seriously that it makes me confused. It's not the typical naughty school girl thing. He buys me outfits and they've always been from his favourite shows/games/films. We have so many costumes that I'll never have to buy another costume for Halloween again.\n\nFor example, he got me a full Hogwarts outfit to wear and he had one too. I thought I would make it a bit slutty so I didn't wear anything except stockings under the robe. He told me to get the shirt on and take the stockings off because \"what student at such a prestigious school of wizardry dresses like that\".\n\nThe next thing is how long and realistic it gets. Using the Harry Potter example, he was a student and he literally spent half an hour talking about the 'OWL exams' and how he was striving for outstanding. It had no relevance to the sex whatsoever. I tried to speed it along but he told me that a Witch wouldn't act like this during her OWLs. It took around an hour of roleplaying until we got to anything sexual.\n\nHe even does voices. I came home to find a Bo Peep outfit once and I had to endure sex with him hearing catchphrases from Woodie. I never thought I would be getting fucked by Woody shouting \"Yee-haw! Giddy-up partner!\"\n\nHe wanted to do Spiderman once so I was meant to be some girl and he wanted to climb through the bedroom window in the middle of the night at a random time. I really don't want to wait all night for some masked man to climb through my window. He said he wasn't going to do Spiderman if he can't climb through the window so we settled on just vanilla sex. It wasn't the same at all though and it feels like he needs the roleplaying. I've told him that I can't be bothered doing it to this extent every time but after 20 minutes of roleplay, it wasn't enough for him and we had below average sex. We've tried without costumes but its still not the same. He just watches ordinary porn too, no costumes. I'm just so puzzled by it all. I had a previous partner who liked roleplay but it was your typical sexy teacher, not me getting fucked by Chewbacca.
