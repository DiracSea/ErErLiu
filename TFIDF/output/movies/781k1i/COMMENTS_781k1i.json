I'm sure some of those 12 million copies were purchased by people who had already read it, as well--to supplement a first edition or a signed copy, to gift to their children, and so on. Unfortunately, science fiction as a genre is inherently niche. Bookreading *in general* is niche, for that matter. There are exceptions--Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, and Agatha Christie for example. But they are exceptions to the rule. And I actually wonder if even Agatha Christie will translate at the box office for Murder on the Orient Express. I suspect it will, but mostly because of the way it's been marketed (as kitschy as the marketing has seemed to me).\n\nConsider even popular fantasy. Game of Thrones' first season had a domestic legal audience of only two million per episode. Now it has roughly 12 million per. TV show adaptations are, of course, different. They can start slow and build their audiences over time if they are well-made. Word of mouth is a lot more effective for serialized material. But films are different. Either you attract people through hype, or you don't and then become a \"cult classic.\" And that's truer for sci-fi than any other genre, unfortunately.\n\nI think Blade Runner might have done better if they marketed it to people who weren't fans of the original. If they had provided a bit more information about replicants in the main trailer, I'd assume more people would be curious. The visual of K breaking through a wall just isn't enough when you have so many superhero films where that happens routinely. You need to present a bit more content, because Blade Runner can't be Star Wars, where lightsabers, John Williams and the Millenium Falcon is enough to drum up hype. Cult classics don't drum up hype as well as universally known/seen franchises. I'm not saying they should have spoiled the whole story for 2049, like a lot of trailers do these days. But do more than present some vague parts of the story. \"I did your job once\" doesn't mean shit if people don't know who Deckard is. Instead, provide a little more detail about replicants and suggest what K's job is.
