Mercury did tell the band he has AIDS, but it wasn't used to persuade them to do LiveAid as the film implies.\n\nTo truly assess if a movie is based in reality, you would have to weigh the importance of events and when they happened.", "created_utc": 1558716968.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "eonnkkf", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_bsgzmi", "parent_id": "t1_eongy5s", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/bsgzmi/first_image_from_james_mangolds_ford_v_ferrari/eonnkkf/", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Jura52", "author_id": "4djkn", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Get paid less if you dont i assume", "created_utc": 1558708021.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "eonanzl", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_bsgzmi", "parent_id": "t1_eonaf8o", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/bsgzmi/first_image_from_james_mangolds_ford_v_ferrari/eonanzl/", "score": 126, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "DenzelWashingtonDC", "author_id": "17l7lfnf", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "> I'm surprised more big actors don't work \"no press tours\" into their contracts\n\nHe does a lot of pressers and promotions for his movies - he just doesn't do late night shows.\n\nHe essentially does the same thing you are laying out - mindless repetitive questions and providing the same answers while trying to act like the questions are interesting or are actually making him think.", "created_utc": 1558709250.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "eoncnhj", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_bsgzmi", "parent_id": "t1_eonaf8o", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/bsgzmi/first_image_from_james_mangolds_ford_v_ferrari/eoncnhj/", "score": 48, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "DavidOrWalter", "author_id": "17fmj5", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "He does.

Note that fat-free mass includes water weight, bones, organs, etc. But the key here is water weight. The steroids definitely worked, however. I just wanted to clear up that it wasn't 7.7lbs of pure muscle, haha.\n    \nThat said, here are the results among groups:  \n   \nNo exercise, no testosterone: 1.2% lean mass increase. 1.7% muscle-area decrease. 1.6% strength increase. Total gain of 1.76lbs of FFM, 1.1lbs of fat. \n   \nNo exercise, testosterone: 4.6% lean mass increase. 8.2% muscle-area increase. 11.1% strength increase. Total gain of 7.04lbs of FFM, 0.7lbs of fat.\n   \nExercise, no testosterone: 2.8% lean mass increase. 4.2% muscle-area increase. 14.9% strength increase. Total gain of 4.4lbs of FFM, -2.42lbs of fat. \n   \nExercise, testosterone: 9.3% lean mass increase. 12.9% muscle-area increase. 30.2% strength increase. Total gain of 13.42lbs of FFM, -0.22lbs of fat. \n   \npretty awesome study and very interesting, for sure.", "created_utc": 1558718932.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1558719223.0, "id": "eonqckh", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_bsgzmi", "parent_id": "t1_eonnpp5", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/bsgzmi/first_image_from_james_mangolds_ford_v_ferrari/eonqckh/", "score": 9, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "nycpenn", "author_id": "16s6rkaq", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199607043350101\n\n>In contrast, to our knowledge the dose of testosterone enanthate administered in this study (600 mg per week) is the highest administered in any study of athletic performance.
