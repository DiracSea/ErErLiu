There are definitely a lot of moments of levity as others have stated. But this amounts to good pacing. If you think back to the book and the miniseries, they always tell you that Richie is the funny guy, but he's only funny to the other characters and not the audience/readers. In this adaptation his character is actually pretty funny. There was a very important moment for the formation of the losers club that the director chose to show in a much different way than a fan of IT might expect.

It's something you've worked towards and built the movie towards.\n\nThe Woman in Black is one of the best examples of a horror movie built around jump scares done right.
