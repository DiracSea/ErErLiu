We have our own kids and our reaction is to fear, mistrust, and bubble wrap. That instinct isn\u2019t completely wrong, (though it has many disadvantages) because we haven\u2019t figured out how to properly handle the mass of abusers that are out there. We haven\u2019t figured out why so many people get off on abusing positions of power. We don\u2019t seem to be ready to examine what it is about us as a species or society that encourages this behaviour, so we fear it, pretend it doesn\u2019t exist, and blame the victims for it\u2019s occurrence. Maybe it\u2019s because when we examine our own sexual behaviour it\u2019s too uncomfortable? \n\nIt evokes strong reactions and opinions in everyone to different ends and for different reasons. \n\nI\u2019m an educator and false accusations by kids do happen. I live in a perpetual state of awareness that this could happen to me. Sometimes kids do it because they are mad about being held accountable for their behaviour. \n\nWe all (male and female educators) operate very carefully in schools because again, there are educators who have in the past and are currently abusing kids. It\u2019s awful. Thankfully they often do get caught and fired, but it is real. \n\nFalse accusations are shitty, and can ruin careers, but what is the alternative? The children who are actually being assaulted need to be protected, and I for one am completely fine following some careful rules about never being alone with students, never shutting a door when I\u2019m with a small group of students. Students are never in my car, and when I do have to have a serious conversation, there is always more than one adult present. \n\nIf those of us who are healthy, non-abusers do our due diligence to protect ourselves from false accusations I am of the opinion that we are indirectly protecting kids from would-be abusers who cross those boundaries. When they cross those boundaries it hopefully seems strange to the kid, raises a huge red flag, perhaps allowing them time to get out of the situation.\n\nSo when you\u2019re feeling sad about having to set personal boundaries around your kids\u2019 friends, remember that it\u2019s because for a long time predators went largely unchecked, and they were often in positions close to their victims (family, family friends, school, church etc.). This new way of being is a reaction to those predators. \n\nWhat is sad is that the predators exist(ed) at all. \n\nI have hope though that one day we will handle all of this better and that we\u2019ll be able to achieve reducing the rates of abuse. I\u2019m not sure how or when, but I believe that talking about it is a crucial step. \n\n\n\n\n\n", "created_utc": 1515878362.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dsmvq83", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7q5x5i", "parent_id": "t1_dsmrkp6", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7q5x5i/eliza_dushku_says_she_was_molested_during_the/dsmvq83/", "score": 9, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "mintberrycrrrunch246", "author_id": "11z5m4", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Are other people coming out saying he sexually molested them too?

They fake kindness and most people will trust them. In a fucked up way, its society's fault because there's this emphasis on performance, someone gives you a gift, you don't like it but you have to act. Someone talks to you and you don't want to and aren't interested but you have to act. Asshole dies/gets what they deserve and you have to act. Hate your job and coworkers, you have to act. Depressed and suicidal, you have to act. We're all actors or most of us at least, I'm starting to think the only difference is they understand that whereas most think they're actually happy all the time or they're really sad because they smile or cry. Too much its just \"I've been conditioned to think x is happiness and so I have x and I'm happy or I don't have x so I'm sad.\" As a black woman, I think white women have largely mastered this behavior. Its so obvious when another woman is playing the victim and being manipulative. I also see it with incel, forever alones quite often. Its crazy, I no longer think its as simple as normal vs psycho, our society creates these roles and people have to perform them. Quite like if you go somewhere like Argentina, in the larger cities people just seem to be performing, attempting to fit themselves into some \"Italian, white, european\" role even if it doesn't fit, its like they're caricatures of themself, you can tell its not deep or who they really are. \n\nThere's this negging that PUA do and its to manipulate you into gaining their approval. \n\nThere's this thing tantrums that children do and its to manipulate you into giving them what they want. \n\nThere's this thing ads that companies do to manipulate you to buy things.\n\nUnfortunately, people can't act directly or overtly so they operate indirectly, covertly, or subliminally to get their way. For some time subliminal was preferred and people skilled at that were pushed to success. At this point, people are waking up and taking everything at face value so directness is coming back into fashion.
