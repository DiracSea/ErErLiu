I have not had the chance to see The Shape of Water yet since it has not come to my area yet, but I am eagerly anticipating it.\n\nMy question has to do with your artistic process in general, particularly your writing. When I watch your films, the way you draw from such an incredibly wide variety of influences (mythology, fairy tales, classic monster movies, gothic literature, etc.) to create something wholly unique and truthful is always breathtaking. When I write, it is hard for me to find things I\u2019m truly interested in expressing (let alone the actual difficulty that comes with expressing them), and when I do, I can\u2019t help but feel like I\u2019m being extremely derivative, whether I\u2019m consciously trying to channel something or not, and so I\u2019m often extremely unconfident in my own writing. I apologize for how unfocused and vague this question is, and I know that this stuff isn\u2019t supposed to be easy, but is there advice you can give me and other amateur filmmakers to help get past this feeling and be able to become better writers?", "created_utc": 1512415502.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dqrgrna", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7hjmvn", "parent_id": "t3_7hjmvn", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7hjmvn/guillermo_del_toro_here_director_gamer_tequila/dqrgrna/", "score": 105, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "jonesev28", "author_id": "s8u57", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Fuck I'm always late ", "created_utc": 1512425448.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dqrqywx", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7hjmvn", "parent_id": "t3_7hjmvn", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7hjmvn/guillermo_del_toro_here_director_gamer_tequila/dqrqywx/", "score": 96, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Everything I've seen about this movie seems absolutely fantastic!
