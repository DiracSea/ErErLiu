Somehow, through a long, illustrious career, he\u2019s convinced Her Majesty to bank roll his life long endeavor of pushing playground bullies off of the top of the slide.\n\nWhen he murders the bomb maker, he says it\u2019s better to have one less bomb maker in the world, but you can tell Bond *wanted* to put him down. \n\nThe look on his face when he stares the terrorist in the eye as the bomb goes off on his hip is so private and personal that you know Bond truly enjoyed that. He wouldn\u2019t have had it any other way.\n\nEven against Le Chifre. He wants to take everything from him. He wants him to be in danger and for his life to be worthless. He wants his long lucrative career to end right there and then.\n\nBond is just a villain working for the good guys, and it makes everything else he goes through make sense.

It's spectacular, but careless film making.\n\nThe bad guys get into Bentleys and drive away. Bond gives chase in an Aston Martin. Now we know Bond is a trained to drive at high speeds, and while Bentleys can be deceptively quick...they aren't outrunning an DB9, even if they had equally good drivers, which is unlikely.\n\nNow in a couple of cuts we see all three cars in one scene. It is quite clear that Bond is no more than 6 or 7 seconds behind and surely gaining ground.\n\nSeveral corners later Bond crests a hill and Vespa is in the road. HOW? Even if Bond failed to close the gap at all, we get a shot of Vespa from the front showing a clear 20-30m stretch of road with no cars on it. So what the fuck happened? Are you trying to tell me a Bentley managed to stop from 100mph, drop off a passenger and then clear the next bend in 6 seconds? It's ludicrous.\n\nBut hey, lets ignore that massive continuity error and assume they just lobbed her out of the car without stopping and Vespa has some hitherto unmentioned super power that allows to slide along asphalt at 60mph without a hair getting out of place. Her hands and feet are bound, but she's clearly not dazed and has had enough time to assess her situation, she knows she's in danger, or she wouldn't be frantically struggling with her bonds (James bonds).\n\nNow I want you to answer this next question with the first thing that comes into your head. Your hands and feet are bound, you're lying in the middle of a road, you hear a car coming. What do you do? You have 7 seconds, (or longer as Bond seems to have somehow managed to lose ground on a luxury sedan full of people).\n\nYour answer is roll out of the way isn't it? Because fucking obviously.\n\nI'm sorry...great action scenes...fucking stupid movie. But hey, at least it wasn't the utter absurdity of Javier Bardem's super natural ability to predict the future that would be required to pull off his \"plan\" in Skyfall.\n\nEdit - Anyone downvoting me, feel free to tell me what I got wrong. I'd love to hear you try and explain this scene in a way that makes ANY sense. It's just awful.

The Cooper is a small, boxy car with a low center of gravity and wide wheel base, which makes it much harder to roll than most other cars. This general design came from Mini wanting to make a car very good at rally racing, where rolling is a very real concern, but dirt road performance is just as important.\n\nSports cars generally also have this advantage in regards to rolling by being low to the ground in order to take turns at higher speeds, but can be more expensive to maintain and insure, and if you live in an area with lots of speed bumps or uneven roads, the underside of a sports car May bump and scrape along the ground more than one would like.\n\nIf neither of these options sound good, the only other advice I could possibly give is to avoid SUVs as much as you can. These cars tend to sit higher on their wheels and are more top-heavy, meaning they're easier to roll. Sedans are lower to the ground, so they don't roll as easily.\n\nEdit: oh and one last thing: The [NHTSA](https://www.nhtsa.gov/ratings), which does the safety ratings for cars, does specific safety ratings for rollover crashes as well as other types of crashes.

I thought Mathis' performance was very similar to his character in 'Hannibal'. \n\nThe torture scene was brutal.
