But I bet some of them were also just waiting on an excuse to get rid of this guy. Shit like this is complicated. \n\nThis isn't just a Hollywood problem, we as a society need to seriously examine how we deal with issues of sexual abuse. The fact that one of these scumbags was literally just elected president proves this is bigger than any individual group or sect or party or class or any of that divisive bullshit. But we can't just get irrational and reactionary every time one of these assholes gets exposed. Instead of attacking the academy we should acknowledge they did the right thing here and then push them hard about taking real proactive steps towards exposing more of this predatory behavior. Everyone loves bringing up the Polanski incident years ago but what about getting statements from these people about him today? Put them on the back pedal in a meaningful way instead of just empty, angry curses.\n\n", "created_utc": 1508026128.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1508026972.0, "id": "dodmbih", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_76eykq", "parent_id": "t1_dodhj5i", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/76eykq/harvey_weinstein_has_been_expelled_from_the/dodmbih/", "score": 22, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "AGnawedBone", "author_id": "94m45", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Call me crazy, but I think, beyond the touching, this is Hollywood getting rid of someone who had a reputation for being universally disliked.

The victims are afraid to come forward, so without accusations there's no action to be taken.\n\n\nOn the one hand, we could say Hollywood should be more closely regulated.

Not because Hollywood found out, as that recent tweet said, but because the public found out. The public is quick to call for a rapist's head, but not until we have a victim come forward.

They degrade people, humiliate them and place them under emotional stress regularly, simply because they are in a position to take out their personal frustrations on others with impunity.
