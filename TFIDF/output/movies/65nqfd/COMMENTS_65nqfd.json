One of my friends had heard it was good but we legitimately had no idea what the movie was about.\n\nIt was an amazing experience, for the first 20 minutes of the movie or so we had no idea the direction it was taking, and I think it did wonders for the cinematography and telling the story in the way the writers intended. \n\n[SPOILER](#s \"Like the first part of the movie had us completely intrigued, we had no idea what this man was doing or where he was headed.

Even once the movie did reach that part we still weren't sure if that was the main focus. And actually, one cool thing about it was that the focus then instead went to the characters and the way that this is just their life instead of \"this is a movie about a man that sells news footage, everything else is extra\". Even if a trailer doesn't give away any of the big plot points, you still gain predispositions about the movie and probably categorize it in your head as a \"_______ movie\". Oh that's a love story, that's just a action movie about cars, that's just a creepy horror film with a possessed kid, you get my drift? You suddenly have a main theme to base your opinion of that movie off of, and I think that takes away from what the writers and producers want someone to experience when they walk into the theater.

The picture on the box is the actual movie in it's entirety (what the creator wants you to see). The trailers and news give you some of the pieces and, because you're so invested and intrigued by how it all goes together, you start hunting for more pieces so you can fix the puzzle. Sometimes the trailer and news gives you all the pieces (spoiler heavy trailers/news), but most times you're still missing pieces and you're frustrated; you want to see more and complete the puzzle.That's pretty much why people still want to see a film despite the spoilers- they have the pieces, but they can't find a way to match the picture on the box. So you go to see the movie with this idea of your puzzle being complete- you've filled the rest of the missing puzzle pieces with your own speculation of what may go there. Based on what you have pieced together, you have one immediate impression of the movie.\n\nNow from here the movie can be one of two things. You can find out the number of pieces you had wasn't sufficient enough to see the picture on the box. That makes the movie great because, even when you had all these pieces, you still had no idea how they fit together. The other thing that can happen is that all your pieces were in fact so similar to the box, your enjoyment of the movie comes from the fact that you completed the picture on the box with all your research. And that is satisfying to some people. Now you get the smug acknowledgement that you were able to complete the puzzle before anyone else. To some people, that's exactly what they want from a movie.
