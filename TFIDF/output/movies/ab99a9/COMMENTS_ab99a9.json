Hopefully Jon Stewart Green Lantern can be adapted after this film's success, he's the man.\n\nThe quality of the film itself almost doesn't matter, because a lot of people's views are clouded by this context. 10 months ago may seem like a long time, but this film touched a cultural landmark no Marvel film had in history (maybe Infinity War, but that was 3 months later).

Long before Iron Man started the Marvel Boom we were watching Arnold fights predators, Neo fights 1's and 0's, Nic Cage fights for his teddy bear and the prom queen, Shia saves the world from the decepticons, Dinosaurs fight fences. Every now and then you get a superhero duo; Willis and Jackson fight terrorists, Will and Jeff fight aliens and so on, or your teamups, Marines fight aliens on earth, Marines fight aliens on LV-426, Cowboys fight aliens.\n\nSuperheroes are the logical conclusion, no need to explain why this person that is 25 years old has decades of military training and whatever else that allows him to fight evil with such precision, it's simple he's a superhero cut out all that bullshit suspension of belief and just cut straight to it. These guys were approaching immortal status as it is in a lot of action movies to much criticism so lets give them a viable reason for their incredible strength and durability.\n\nThe Matrix was a great movie and had some original ideas and so forth, but ultimately was just another superhero origin story, just with the world having powers instead of the guy essentially.
