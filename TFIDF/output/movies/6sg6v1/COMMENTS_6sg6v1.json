Realized after writing it that I had a lot more to say about this than I thought I did...\n\nI already quit. I was so hyped initially when it was just Crunchyroll. Be able to legally watch anime conveniently? Awesome! I was even still onboard when Funimation joined in - more competition is good!\n\nBut then even before stuff like Netflix and Anime Strike came around, things started to get shitty.\n\nCrunchyroll episodes were often bad quality, especially on older shows. If you go look at Working!! on Crunchyroll it looks like it's 480p. The quality of subtitles is often severely lacking as well, as they made a lot of \"cringy\" and \"meme-y\" jokes in the subtitles like with Gabriel Dropout translating \"itadakimasu\" to \"In the name of the dark lord, amen\". They also tended to use the worst possible versions of shows, with stuff like JoJo's Bizarre Adventure being the censored version of the show. Also their servers are often really bad, with them going down every Saturday night like clockwork and basically being unusable until midnight.\n\nFunimation, I have a lot fewer complaints about, but their Roku app was very laggy and frustrating to use for the longest time. They recently redid it, so that might be improved now (but I haven't yet used it). They also did some of the \"meme-y\" shit Crunchyroll did, like with the infamous \"gamergater\" line in Prison School. The actual subtitles themselves though on Funimation just always looked like crap. I don't know the technical terms here, but the subtitles were generally arranged very poorly on the screen and made it difficult to follow what was going on and who was talking. Funimation is mostly (exclusively?) dub focused now though, so again this might not be an issue anymore.\n\nSo yeah, this is a long rant. But basically what it boils down to is: Anime streaming had a lot of great potential and I (and many others) was totally on board with it and hype to be able to support the creators of content I liked. But then streaming services totally dropped the ball on quality and service, and now they're splintering like crazy and trying to force us to pay for 4 different subscriptions to watch the shows.\n\nSo the options are: \n\n1. Pay a *lot* of money to deal with shitty apps, laggy servers, bad subtitles, and poor video quality.\n1. Pay nothing to get professional quality subtitles on the best possible versions of each show.\n\nNot hard to see why a lot of people are starting to go back to option 2.", "created_utc": 1502233736.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1502235928.0, "id": "dlcqm9g", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6sg6v1", "parent_id": "t1_dlcpjid", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6sg6v1/disney_will_pull_its_movies_from_netflix_and/dlcqm9g/", "score": 752, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "SerbianShitStain", "author_id": "9waib", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "[removed]", "created_utc": 1502233945.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dlcqsnp", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6sg6v1", "parent_id": "t1_dlcpjid", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6sg6v1/disney_will_pull_its_movies_from_netflix_and/dlcqsnp/", "score": 143, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Isn't Amazon kinda like that?

At the time they didn't want their stuff online because they felt it would \"cheapen\" their product. Then, if they were going to go online, it would have to be on *their* terms, on *their service.* They wanted to be the ones making the money, not anyone else. There was no way film was going to end up online. Music was beginning to go online, but only with great reluctance.\n\nI think the music and film publishers in particular are too used to having all the power; traditionally they've got to decide all the terms of any agreement, and they have this in-built hatred of anyone else having any power (or making any profit) from their stuff.\n\nSo if stuff does go online, it has to be on *their* service. They have to have complete control over pricing, release windows, ideally with only their-brand stuff. And they have to feel that they're getting a better deal than anyone else. Oh, and the other big thing they wanted at the time was for the tech companies to put in all the investment, create the service, secure it (with whatever meaningless anti-copying system the publishers demanded), bring in a large customer base and *then*, if they paid upfront, the publishers would let them use their content.\n\nSteam works because Steam managed to get big enough before any one game publisher could say no. And now the independent gaming scene is large enough to keep it going even when the big publishers (looking at you EA) pull out.\n\niTunes works because Apple was in a position to just buy out all the music publishers if it didn't get its way.\n\nSpotify worked because it was a small, foreign market, and even then it had to hand over a good chunk of its equity to the publishers.\n\nNetflix's physical service was able to become a big thing (as with Amazon) due to the First Sale doctrine (why physical Netflix never took off in the UK - it would have been illegal). They then were able to leverage their market share to sneak in this streaming service, but that was before the film publishers thought it would be a big deal; it was just a niche thing (who had the Internet capacity to stream films, and even then, who would watch a film on a computer rather than a proper TV?). Once Netflix started doing well, you have film publishers pulling out again.\n\nI'm not sure how Amazon managed to keep going. Again, I have a feeling it's a case of them being big enough to threaten to buy out publishers, or at least pay them lots of money.\n\nBut yes; a Steam for movies/TV would be great. But it isn't going to happen.
