To me, that's an \"acceptable\" amount of time to consider a remake. Also, there were clearly huge advances in filmmaking technology during that time, and also a lot more people who would be able to see the film in general, meaning the entire idea of a remake made total sense. 35 years is pretty much a full generation that has gone by, and you're also talking about a time when there was no home media - so if you didn't see the original film in 1925 or whatever, you didn't ever see it again, either. So a remake would have been an absolutely exciting concept.\n\nI'm not anti-remake. Some of the best movies of all time have been remakes. What I can't stand is when we start getting remakes/reboots only a few years later. Within a decade? Totally ridiculous. \n\nDespite all that, there are more \"original\" films released every year than the year before. They aren't generally the massive box office draws, but they're there. You need to seek them out, because the media buzz is going to be over the sequels, franchises, and \"name\" films. Original films aren't hard to find at all if you want them, at least.

I\u2019ve pretty much always played Halo since the first game came out, and played CoD a bit back in the day - well when the latest Black Ops had a battle royale mode in it, I decided to pick it up again, and it\u2019s just crazy how much time and effort is spent on little details in a game like Halo vs one like CoD. \n\nExample: in Halo (at least since the 360/Xbox one days) your player models legs and feet are always flush with the ground, and they always bend/move to any kind of elevation you\u2019re standing on, while in CoD your character is almost always floating 1-2 inches off the ground and any time you walk across uneven ground your characters feet and legs always clip into the ground or will be like a full 12\u201d off of the ground when the ground  has a steep slope. This doesn\u2019t change gameplay at all and really isn\u2019t a crucial difference between the two games, but things like that have always been an indicator to me about whether a developer really put in the time to get the little details to be just right or if they simply cut and pasted most of the previous game so that they could release it in time for their yearly cycle.
