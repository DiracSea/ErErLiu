Mr. Williams, who studied piano with longtime Juilliard faculty member Rosina Lh\u00e9vinne, announced the gift at a special alumni event held in Los Angeles at the Four Seasons Beverly Hills, where Mr. Williams was also presented with a President\u2019s Medal by Juilliard President Joseph W. Polisi.\n\nAcknowledging this gift, Juilliard President Joseph W. Polisi said, \u201cWe are deeply grateful to John for his extraordinary generosity in bequeathing Juilliard his extensive library of both concert and film scores. John has been a wonderful friend and colleague for many years. His artistry, creativity, and endless imagination make him one of the most admired and respected musicians of our time. His gift will be a unique resource for all of our musicians at the school, particularly composition students who can study first-hand John\u2019s breadth and versatility as a composer.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince my earliest days as a fledgling piano student, I have looked up to the Juilliard School as the Mecca for the study of music in our country and beyond,\u201d Mr. Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s therefore a privilege for me to donate my sketches, papers, and scores to Juilliard, to be made available to those students particularly interested in the intimate processes of film scoring.\u201c\n\nJuilliard\u2019s vice president for library and information resources, Jane Gottlieb, said: \u201cThe John Williams Music Collection will be an extraordinary resource for scholars, students, and all who are interested in understanding his career as a composer and conductor.\n\nThe John Williams Music Collection will be part of the Peter Jay Sharp Special Collections and Juilliard School Archives, which also include the Jennie Tourel, Soulima Stravinsky, and many other notable collections. The Special Collections are housed in the school\u2019s Lila Acheson Wallace Library. In appreciation of all of these generous donations, Juilliard exhibits materials from these collections on a regular basis.\n\nMr. Williams, who turned 86 in February, is in his 60th year of composing concert music as well as music for films and television. His next major work is a fantasia for cello, harp, and orchestra that will be premiered by the Boston Symphony Orchestra on August 19 at Tanglewood as part of the Leonard Bernstein Centennial. He wrote the work, Highwood\u2019s Ghost, for Juilliard cello alumnus Yo-Yo Ma and harpist Jessica Zhou. Mr. Williams holds the title of Boston Pops Laureate Conductor, which he assumed following his retirement in 1993 after 14 successful seasons. He also holds the title of artist in residence at Tanglewood.\n\nMr. Williams\u2019 works for the concert stage include two symphonies, cello and harp concertos for the Boston Symphony Orchestra, a bassoon concerto for the New York Philharmonic, a trumpet concerto for the Cleveland Orchestra, and a horn concerto for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. In 2009, he composed and arranged Air and Simple Gifts for the first inaugural ceremony of President Barack Obama.\n\nMr. Williams has received five Oscars and 24 Grammys\u2014the most recent Grammy was in January. He has received 51 Academy nominations, more than any other living person. His latest nomination was for his score to Star Wars: The Last Jedi. He has composed the music and served as music director for more than 100 films, including all eight Star Wars films, the first three Harry Potter films, Superman, JFK, Born on the Fourth of July, Memoirs of a Geisha, Far and Away, The Accidental Tourist, Home Alone, and The Book Thief. His 40-year artistic partnership with director Steven Spielberg has resulted in many of Hollywood\u2019s most acclaimed and successful films, including Schindler\u2019s List (recorded with violinist Itzhak Perlman, a Juilliard faculty member and alumnus), E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, Jaws, Jurassic Park, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, the Indiana Jones films, Munich, Saving Private Ryan, The Adventures of Tintin, War Horse, and Lincoln. Mr. Williams\u2019 contributions to television music include scores for more than 200 television films. He also composed themes for the 1984, 1988, and 1996 Summer Olympic Games, and the 2002 Winter Olympic Games.\n\nIn addition to the awards mentioned above, Mr. Williams has received seven British Academy Awards (BAFTA), four Golden Globes, five Emmys, and has had numerous gold and platinum records. He received the prestigious Kennedy Center Honors in December 2004. In 2009, he was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and that same year he also received the National Medal of Arts, the highest award given to artists by the U.S. Government. In 2016, he received the 44th Life Achievement Award from the American Film Institute\u2014the first time this honor was bestowed upon a composer. \n\nThe son of a CBS radio orchestra percussionist, Mr. Williams was born in Flushing in 1932 and started studying piano at the age of 6. His family moved to Los Angeles when he was in high school, and he subsequently attended UCLA and Los Angeles City College, concentrating on the study of orchestration. He also studied composition privately with Italian composer Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco. Serving in the U.S. Air Force during the Korean War, he played, conducted, and arranged music for military bands. In 1954, after having completed two years of military duty, he began his piano studies with longtime Juilliard faculty member Rosina Lh\u00e9vinne and also played jazz piano in nightclubs. He returned to Los Angeles in 1956, securing his first job with the film industry as a studio pianist. One of his first projects was South Pacific. He has worked with a number of accomplished film composers, among them Bernard Herrmann, also a Juilliard alumnus.\n\nMr. Williams\u2019 relationship with Juilliard has continued over the years\u2014in 2004, he received an honorary doctorate and in 2006, he conducted the Juilliard Orchestra in the school\u2019s centennial gala, which was broadcast on Live From Lincoln Center on PBS. In 2011, Juilliard named its orchestra library, which houses scores and parts for the Juilliard Orchestra and other ensembles, after him.\n\nAbout Juilliard\u2019s Library and Archives\n\nThe Lila Acheson Wallace Library at Juilliard is a comprehensive resource for the school\u2019s performance and research needs.

We were teased throughout the first few scenes about what was to come, but everything finally put together, the majesty of the dinosaur, the reaction of the actors, and not least of all the music that scored it helped truly encapsulate the moment as something special. From then on we were taken away. This was no actor in a cheesy dinosaur costume. This was REAL. Hammond and Lucas and Speilberg had literally brought this creatures to life in front of our very eyes. There they were. They were no longer words on a page and pictures in a book but living breathing creatures. We could see them, and like Dr. Grant, we could watch them, enjoy them, and embrace them. The journey continued on Site B when we saw they weren't just tame docile zoo attraction but living beings that engaged in a complex ecosystem. When let free they went back to their primal instinct, and the movie did us the favor of leaving their destruction out, keeping the dream and the idea intact. \n\nFinally, Jurassic World. Years had past and the generation that grew up as kids first seeing these movies, first believing has come to age. We have kids of our own now. Jobs, and lives and whatnot. But deep down we still hold on and want to believe. Finally when the trailer premiers, specifically right [here](https://youtu.be/RFinNxS5KN4?t=35s) we are again thrown back to when we are kids and believe again. The dream has been fulfilled. The Park is open. Not only is the Park open but it's thriving. People can reach out and touch these mythical beasts. We can almost reach out and touch them. Hammond's legacy and dream, our legacy and dream, is being fulfilled before our very eyes and we can't wait and see what happens next. Dinosaurs and man, side by sad, once again. \n\nAnytime after that we could go back and watch this scene (from JP) and it still had the same reverence it did when we first saw it, we were taken back to the first time, when we believed and desperately wanted them to be real. It doesn't matter that this movie is almost 30 years old. It doesn't matter that it is unrealistic. For many it will still be the beginning of a wonderful journey, that has its up and downs, might pull at your heart strings, but ultimately reaches to the deepest parts of your imagination and says \"yes, they are real\", all of which is scored by the magnificent John Williams.
