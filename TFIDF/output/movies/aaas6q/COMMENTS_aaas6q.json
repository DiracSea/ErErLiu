I honestly think Annihilation is the best of the year. Critics seemed to love it. Audiences not so much. One of the things I liked about the film was how simple it was. It was a pretty straightforward journey / expedition plot. Sure a lot of strange stuff happens, but that doesn't mean the plot is hard to follow.\n\nI suspect audiences didn't like it because the ending was ambiguous. Unless you pull off a Nolan-style Inception, audiences don't tend to like ambiguity in an ending.", "created_utc": 1546024418.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "ecqyyaj", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_aaas6q", "parent_id": "t1_ecqencb", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/aaas6q/obama_shares_his_favorite_movies_of_the_year/ecqyyaj/", "score": 8, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "onlyrealcuzzo", "author_id": "4yndr", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Nah he'll just list all the Transformers movies ", "created_utc": 1546027601.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "ecr45u3", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_aaas6q", "parent_id": "t1_ecqzipo", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/aaas6q/obama_shares_his_favorite_movies_of_the_year/ecr45u3/", "score": 25, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "ASAPSocky", "author_id": "wltru", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "For anyone that reads the Onion, this is perfectly in line with the rebellious teen they wrote Biden to be", "created_utc": 1546028546.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "ecr5rrx", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_aaas6q", "parent_id": "t1_ecqzipo", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/aaas6q/obama_shares_his_favorite_movies_of_the_year/ecr5rrx/", "score": 15, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "SpicyLemonWater", "author_id": "8t1k0a", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "*Infinity War* was a better Sherlock film just from having both RDJ and Cumberbatch in it than either *Gnomes* or *Holmes and Watson*.", "created_utc": 1546028451.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "ecr5lsk", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_aaas6q", "parent_id": "t1_ecr15r7", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/aaas6q/obama_shares_his_favorite_movies_of_the_year/ecr5lsk/", "score": 15, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "damurphy72", "author_id": "smur5", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Not true that he's seen as a punchline -- at least not to everybody.

The New Yorker compared you to Thoreau, but it definitely felt Lovecraftian to me. Did you always have a proclivity for the strange and inexplicable in literature?**\n\n>JV: When I started writing short stories, I thought what I was writing was pretty normal and usual, but my friends always told me it was a bit weird, a bit surreal and dreamlike.

I\u2019m not a huge fan of Lovecraft, and especially not with regard to this trilogy because I think the trilogy embodies the antithesis of what Lovecraft valued.
