I assume they feel clever about pointing it out.\n\nEDIT: **A preemptive response because I'm going out and don't want to come home to an inbox of hate.**\n\nThese days most people working in film roles such as Cinematographer and Director of Photography start out in regular, good ol' still photography. 10 years ago, no one was using DSLR, it was all analog film. There are many different types of film that all have a distinct look. You can tweak the look in development, but the 'essence' of the film is there. I'm not the most experienced film shooter in the world, but if someone shoots Portra, I can spot Portra. In today's age of digital DSLR, everybody still wants that 'film' look, with lifted blacks and a stylish amount of noise. That's why VSCO filters exist. Like with everything digital, the analogue look is still more fashionable.\n\nPhotographers only have one frame to get the most out of an image. 'Temperature' is a key factor in evoking as much meaning as possible from this image. We can make the image cooler or warmer, essentially by lifting blues or lifting yellows and oranges. Different types and brands of film are designed to provide this variation.\n\nHistory Lesson: Despite what angry YouTubers might tell you, Michael Bay did not invent orange/blue split-toning. \n\nBy the time photographers move to film, they're hard-wired to think this way, especially modern cinematographers and DoPs who stepped straight from DSLR to RED and similar formats. The guy who put that shot together wanted it to feel hot, dusty and sticky. I'd say that colour-grading does exactly that. \n\nIf you can come up with a better reason to NOT have that colour-grading, I'm all ears.\n\n", "created_utc": 1477545237.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1477548511.0, "id": "d99m9ou", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_59kxt8", "parent_id": "t1_d99hafj", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/59kxt8/james_bonds_fake_day_of_the_dead_parade_was_so/d99m9ou/", "score": 431, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "It's the smog.  \n  \n/s", "created_utc": 1477547559.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d99na41", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_59kxt8", "parent_id": "t1_d99hafj", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/59kxt8/james_bonds_fake_day_of_the_dead_parade_was_so/d99na41/", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "yeswesodacan", "author_id": "bdrk7", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Jesus Christ Marie, just turn up the blue and  it will be cool.

Its a classic case of overhype IMO. Skyfall was amazing, a solid 9 and people wanted Spectre to be a 10.

They did it without being overly campy. If they continue that i will be annoyed as it was nice for one film but thats it. I dont think Waltz's/Blofeld 's motive was childish at all. I think people misunderstood it as well. He didnt start Spectre and go nuts because he resented Bonds relationship with their dad. He was going that path to begin with and decided to mess with Bond since he had the means and resented his relationship with their dad. People got it backwards and it looks stupid that way but if you take it from another angle you see why it was done and it makes sense. It also makes the tie ins with the other movies easier to swallow as well. On a final note they did waste Waltz's talent tho and i hope him and Craig come back so they can take advantage of what he can do.

Classic Bond is fun, but it's not what I'd call good.\n\nThis is a question of subjectivity, though, isn't it? I'm 100% okay with silliness. In fact, I find modern superhero films and shows to be borderline unwatchable, because they've lost sight of what they were; Frank Miller changed comics, and Chris Nolan changed comic-inspired films. But I feel like we need some silliness injected back in, because this insistence on gritty and dark wears on you after a while, or at least it wears on me. Guardians of the Galaxy was brilliant precisely because it remembered that superheroes are an inherently ridiculous proposition.\n\nBond, I feel, is sort of the same. It's a completely ridiculous concept, and there are only two ways to play it: Throw it away and start over, Casino Royale style, or embrace the absurdity of the whole concept. Personally, I enjoy a completely absurd spy movie sometimes -- and if it's enjoyable to watch, it's *good* on some level. Maybe not a masterpiece of film, but good anyway. \n\nMaybe a good comparison here is Zombieland vs. Shaun of the Dead. The former is utterly absurd and nearly every scene is hilarious. The same is largely true of Shaun of the Dead, but I think the latter is not quite as funny... but is a better film. Shaun of the Dead's parody is so on-point that I still notice new things every time I watch it. It's the best horror spoof since Young Frankenstein. And behind all that is a really solid story with excellent acting -- the scene where Shaun's mother dies is truly moving.\n\nZombieland will never end up in the same category as Shaun of the Dead and Young Frankenstein, because it doesn't succeed on all of the same levels. But it's good fun anyway! It's a good movie.
