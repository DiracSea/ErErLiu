Manhattan district attorney Cy Vance decided not to pursue charges at that time, a move that has been widely criticized in the aftermath of the cascade of accusations leveled at Weinstein in late 2017. The move also angered factions of the NYPD, which had wired Battilana at the time and made a recording of an encounter between her and Weinstein in which he is heard admitting to assaulting her. That case may have proved to be the crack in armor of Weinstein, who had buffered himself with a series of legal settlements followed by non-disclosure agreements.

So a public prosecutor litigates the case and can seek punishments designed to keep the community safe, like incarceration, fines paid to the government, or even the death penalty. \n\nIt's a bit messy because criminal courts can order restitution, where the criminal pays money to the victim to make the victim whole. Also, crime victims can have an attorney to represent them in a civil case  to try to recover money for the damage caused by the crime. It's essentially two separate layers of punishment for the same act. If someone assaults you, it could be a crime punishable by imprisonment or fines to cover the cost of the public having to prosecute the crime. But it can also be a violation of civil law (which is seen as less serious than criminal assault and is therefore easier to prove) that entitles you to money to cover, say, medical bills and emotional distress.\n\nThere is a lot of history behind how this system came to be this way. It wasn't always this way. Until around the 1200s in England, crimes could be prosecuted privately by the victim. The punishment was a monetary fine paid to the victim. Physical punishment like hanging or incarceration was not the standard. The law gradually evolved for reasons that are too complex to get into.
