The plot is impossibly transparent, and at some points even appears to try to steal concepts from Pixar... and fails dramatically. Each major scene leaves you with a feeling of \"I've seen this before a hundred times, but better.\"\n\nThe jokes? Comedic puns a five year old would dish out OR painful dad jokes. Cringe-worthy. I wish I were kidding, too. Y'know the kind of joke people think of and instantly feel embarrassed because they're ashamed their brain somehow churned out something *that bad*? That's Emoji Movie... except they took the cringe and gave it to an actor. There's no intelligent humor, the dialogue lacks subtleties, and it never tries to reach for anything other than low hanging fruit. Poop Emoji in a scene? Prepare for doody jokes from any character that has to interact with him.\n\nThe only props I can give to the movie is the voice acting from the main characters is on point. That's it. James Corden as High-Five is genuinely enjoyable, and TJ's pretty good overall, but... that's it. That's all I can point out on a positive.

The best part of it was probably TJ Miller's voice acting, but even some of his lines were cringe worthy.  I felt embarrassed for the other actors I recognized (except Sir Stewart) that they were involved in such a terrible project.  To be honest, I felt like I was watching the Lego Movie on morphine.\n\nTo fill anyone in on what the plot could possibly be, it's basically the same as the Lego Movie.  We're introduced to a colorful city full of wacky characters we already know and meet a boring person about to start their day.  The only difference here is that Emmet is actually happy, and the Meh Emoji... Isn't?  It's not really clear what his issue is beyond not being able to be Meh, which honestly sounds like a good thing not to be... I made it as far as when our Emoji Emmet meets Emoji Wildstyle in a bar and can, (get this) make any expression he wants.  He can become a lovey eyed emoji, or be a sick one, or an angry one, whatever.  On Meh's first day at work, he royally fucks up, destroys an emoji scanner while failing to be Meh.  Afterward, he's deemed a \"malfunction\" and is hunted by boots to terminate him.  Oh, and all this is going on inside some douchey kid's phone.  He tries to send a Meh text, Meh fucks up inside the phone, sends a sneezing emoji instead and that's the story. Again, I only made it perhaps half way through and don't plan on finishing it, but it was my testimant to give it a chance and see just how bad the film actually was.\n\nIt obviously was Hollywood trying to cash in on young people and whatever is popular at the time, but it didn't work at all this time.  The Lego Movie worked because on top of already being familiar with the toys, the story had relevance.  And it was genuinely funny too.  The Emoji movie had no joke it.
