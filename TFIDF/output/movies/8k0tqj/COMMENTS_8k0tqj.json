Movies work because the protagonist(s) start the movie with a flaw, a weakness that the trials the movie puts them through will help them overcome, but because Hollywood is afraid of alienating women by making a flawed female character, they start out as perfect and have nowhere to go. This means there\u2019s nothing for the audience to invest in.\n\nTake a look at The Force Awakens vs A New Hope, for example. Luke\u2019s a brat who thinks in his young mind that he knows everything, and then he\u2019s thrown into a situation where he\u2019s forced to grow up, and he\u2019s not ready for it. In The Force Awakens, Rey, a strong female, has no personal imperfections and therefore nowhere to go.\n\nSame with Ghostbusters. You\u2019ve got a bunch of guys who are starting this business for their own selfish reasons, and through the course of the film they each have to overcome their personal flaws and put their selfishness aside to bring about a positive outcome. In the remake, the characters have no flaws, no weaknesses, so the wisecracking simply comes across as obtuse.\n\nThe point is that films need a character with an arc, to have room to grow, lessons to learn. As Emilia Clarke alluded the other day, the strong woman trope (even though it has come about through female group pressure) doesn\u2019t marry with the narrative string we\u2019re all used to. Sure, a female protagonist can be strong, but not in every single way. \n\nEdit: If you\u2019re interested in learning more about how screenplays are written, check out Save the Cat by Blake Snyder,

In that time, he builds his team, none of which need to be trained because they're all specialists in their own fields and neatly fill their role in the plan.
