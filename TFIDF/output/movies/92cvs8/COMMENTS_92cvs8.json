In recent weeks, we\u2019ve heard new rumors of a large DreamWorks presence in the Magic Kingdom-style park. Other brands rumored for the new park include *Lord of the Rings* and *Jurassic World*.\n\n> All indications point to Universal fast-tracking the new park with an opening now expected in the mid-2020s. That would place only a few years after the rumored 2021 Orlando opening of Super Nintendo World. \n\n> With this difference now being less than 48 months, and with other projects in the works for Universal Studios Florida, including a rumored Ministry of Magic attraction at the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, and a new live-action mixed-media show replacing the now-closed Terminator 2 attraction, it seems Universal would get the most impact by placing this extremely popular brand in the new park instead.
