One Monday night I am still awake in my apartment around 6am (having gone out that night) and all the sudden I hear it go from completely silent to 100 cars honking loudly. Hmmm that's strange but whatever. 10 seconds later I hear a huge BOOM! Like an explosion or something and I run to the window.\n\nI see all of the cars completely motionless and in the intersection in front of the Aria I see a SWAT car and a limo that looks completely totaled. Then I hear a helicopter swing by that I hadn't heard before and in the midst of my confusion and fear, all of the cars start backing up from this one intersection on all sides. I start to panic wondering what these cars are so afraid of and where the boom came from. You have to remember - this is about 100 yards from where the woman ran over a few people at Planet Hollywood a couple of months earlier and maybe 2-300 yards from where the gun fight happened a couple years ago resulting in a cab flipping and an innocent cab driver and passenger dying in the ensuing car fire. \n\nAnyway, mid freak out I turn on the news and eventually figure out that they were filming the new Bourne movie. The cars were backing up so they could shoot the limo crash scene (which is what I heard) one more time because apparently they screwed it up. They warned the building the next day with an email, as I'm sure I was not the only one caught off guard and a little scared. They filmed this scene for the next 5 nights and it was incredibly cool to watch how they did it. The video you see was one of what had to be dozens of takes of the same shot. And then each night they'd move further and further down the strip, essentially filming one block per night.\n\nThe most amazing thing I think was watching the cars get lined up. There had to be 200+ cars each day that needed to be in perfect order and driving in sync. This alone took at least an hour or two every night. And then to leave they would line up in order to make it easy to setup again the next day.

The camera is the tool to imply the movement, especially in fight choreography. Asian martial arts films are an exception to this, but Greengrass and the Bourne films are a good example of ushering in the quick cut, realistic fighting that basically everyone does now. It's actually a lot easier for the actors to do more realistic fight techniques, and then use handheld camera techniques to imply even more overt movement. It also costs more to do a wider take, such as in the Marvel films where their fighting is literally otherworldly, so it takes more to sell it in broader strokes both in fighting and camera capture. \n\nBut as for car chases, it's rare when something really, really, risky is being done. Mostly because you have to do it over and over again. So it's easier to imply movement with the camera. Something like Bourne in Ultimatum taking that car backwards off the parking deck was shot statically and maybe done two or three times. Wouldn't be surprised if it was just once. \n\nShould say I work in the film industry, just for clarity's sake.

The car and the arm don't separate ever again (unless someone screws up badly). \n\nI believe this was the solution to the matter of inertia. Yes, they counterbalance the arm so it's a neutral weight on the arm, but when you accelerate, the CG will pull back and cause the arm to boom up. The reverse happens when you hit the breaks. So they generally build into the design a compensation for the car's acceleration. \n\nAnyway, it looks like one of these Filmotechnic Russian Arms.
