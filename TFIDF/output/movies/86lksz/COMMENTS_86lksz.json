From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Chongren):\n\n> Herg\u00e9's early albums of The Adventures of Tintin were highly dependent on stereotypes for comedic effect. These included evil Russian Bolsheviks, lazy and dumb black Africans, and an America of gangsters, cowboys, and Indians.\n\n\n> At the close of the newspaper run of Cigars of the Pharaoh, Herg\u00e9 had mentioned that Tintin's next adventure (The Blue Lotus) would bring him to China. Father Gosset, the chaplain to the Chinese students at the University of Leuven, wrote to Herg\u00e9 urging him to be sensitive about what he wrote about China. Herg\u00e9 agreed, and in the spring of 1934 Gosset introduced him to Zhang Chongren. \n\n\n> The two young artists quickly became close friends, and Zhang introduced Herg\u00e9 to Chinese history, culture, and the techniques of Chinese art. As a result of this experience Herg\u00e9 would strive, in The Blue Lotus and subsequent Tintin adventures, to be meticulously accurate in depicting the places Tintin visited.\n", "created_utc": 1521828591.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1521828845.0, "id": "dw687l5", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_86lksz", "parent_id": "t1_dw66khm", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/86lksz/steven_spielberg_confirms_peter_jackson_will/dw687l5/", "score": 165, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "clearisland", "author_id": "cxx8j", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "yeah that one hasn't aged too well", "created_utc": 1521827480.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dw66y98", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_86lksz", "parent_id": "t1_dw66khm", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/86lksz/steven_spielberg_confirms_peter_jackson_will/dw66y98/", "score": 43, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "jimx117", "author_id": "5npvz", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Tintin in Congo is one of the worst actually.
