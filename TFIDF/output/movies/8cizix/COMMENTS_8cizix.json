Eight eons of basic training now await him, and he is feeling pretty content. Why is he so content? Because for some strange reason, their new drill instructor is a human that came from the earth above, a mere mortal that is now destined to spend eternity instructing demons on eternal warfare. It is obvious that Satan has no need for another battalion, and they will be spending the next eight eons punishing this disgraceful human for his sins. Satan is always thinking of new ways to punish the damned, and since this is how the human lived on earth, they will be performing several unspeakable acts of psychological madness on him. Seefus sits down on his bunk as Satan walks in, surveying the recruits around him. This is what all the demons believe. They are, however, wrong. Satan looks gleefully at Seefus, then smirks at a couple of other demons playing cards at a nearby table they had set up in the middle of the alley. \"I thought I told you to stand at attention.\" He rumbled at the soldiers. They all laughed, but the laughter quickly faltered as Satans face obviously showed he was not joking. Satan quickly smiled and said. \"On second thought, at ease ladies. This will be fun. For me at least.\". Satan walked to the front of the alley and stood at attention, before calling out. \"They are ready for you sir!\". *Sir* thought Seefus.. Why would the Prince of Darkness call anyone sir, a mortal at that. Feeling uneasy he stood up and stood at attention. The other demons sat around uncomfortably, readying their pitch forks as they listened to heavy boots walking down the corridor towards them. \"Should we go ahead and stick the little shrimo as soon as he shows up Satan? Or should we commence psychological shaming by acting out of line?\". Droigen asked this as he stood up. But before Satan could say a word, their new Senior Drill Instructor entered the light of the flames, looking at Droigen with disgust. The demons blood ran cold as the moment of realization passed through them, cold as a blade in the arctic tundra. R. Lee Ermey walked up to Droigen, bitch slapping him in the face. \"What the fuck did you just call me you little shit brained maggot! Why the fuck are you not by your bunk! WHY THE FUCK IS EVERYONE PLAYING CARDS!!!  AM I GOING TO HAVE TO FUCK EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU UNTIL YOU CAN NEVER LOOK YOUR PARENTS IN THE EYE AGAIN, OR DO I NEED TO RIP OFF YOUR HORNS AND SHOVE THEM IN YOUR DISGUSTING EYES AND SKULL FUCK YOU? MAYBE THEN YOUR BRAINS WILL WORK RIGHT AND I WON'T FEEL LIKE I AM TEACHING PUSSY TO A BUNCH OF QUEERS!!! \". The demons all scampered to their positions, several, pissing themselves.\nEdit: This short story was made to honor R. Lee Ermey. I am no implying I think he went to hell. It is a tribute to how badass he is and how much I will truly miss him. Also, everyone knows marines never die, they just go to hell to regroup.

We gathered some snacks and walked outside.  Gunny was there manning a little booth with two stacks of papers in front of him.  The stacks in front of him were 8x10s of his character in Full Metal Jacket.  I recognized him immediately - how can you not? - He's Marine Corps personified.  Anyhow he didn't have a line just him standing behind the little booth. So I walk up and introduce myself.  I tell him how much I adored his role in Kubrick's film and I asked if he'd be cool choking me like he does Pyle. He didn't hesitate and started choking me immediately.  My buddy had my camera - the disposable type- so the smile I have is me nervously laughing and telling his ass to hurry and take the picture! The Gunny had a mean grip! \n\nWe talked afterwards for a while about boot camp, he was really excited to hear about our experience.  He was a down to earth man, I remember being in awe of the sheer size of him. The Eagle, Globe and Anchor ring on his finger was huge. The globe looked to be a diamond! Just massive! He probably talked with us for an entire hour. He asked about us mostly - who we were, where we came from, what our goals were - He was genuinely interested in our stories or at least it seemed that way. I'm sure he'd heard them a million times from different people. But as a boot-fresh Marine it felt amazing to not be talked down to by such a cultural iconic figure especially as we were being talked down to by everyone else. He signed 8x10s for both of us and wished us well in our travels. \n\nI found out later that he would do that booth thing a lot. He didn't charge anyone a dime. It turned out we were lucky to have had the time we did because most times he'd be very busy. I'm very thankful for everything that happened. I will always remember that day.

One of my drill instructors was watching us while we pulled pits at the range once. This was on Parris Island which has an insane amount of sand fleas. Anyway this guy sort of pretends that nobody is watching him and let\u2019s one land on his arm. \n\nHe goes through the entire DI chow hall speech with the sand flea letting it drink his blood. \u201cAttack the chow hall!\u201d \u201cMove the blood to your face not your face to the blood.\u201d He isn\u2019t yelling this he is just talking to it. After a few minutes he finally says, \u201cStack trays.\u201d Which means we are done eating get up right now. The sand flea obviously doesn\u2019t stop eating so he raises his voice a little like, \u201cI said stack trays!\u201d Finally he smacks the sand flea and kills it mumbling something like, \u201cthat\u2019s what happens when you don\u2019t listen to the drill instructor.\u201d After that he just kinda wandered away and yelled at recruits and stuff. \n\nThese guys 100% drink beers and come up with funny stuff/share ideas all the time. This was the same guy who crawled in through a window when we were on our personal time and went underneath a recruits bed and just listened. At some point he jumps out and starts making fun of this kid for something he was talking about. Hilarious.
