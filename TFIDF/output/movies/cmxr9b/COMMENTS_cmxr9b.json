Around ten years ago they didn\u2019t seem to know what to do with X-men.

The Wolverine was an okay start. Days of Future Past was pretty great. Deadpool was really funny and broke tons of records. Logan was goddamn amazing. X-men Apocalypse, while nowhere near as good as the films I mentioned, was a serviceable ending to the young X-men trilogy. And Deadpool 2 just brought more of what I loved about the first movie. They were on a hot streak. This is where Fox should\u2019ve hung up their spurs.\n\nBut for some inexplicable reason they decided to make X-men 4, a direct sequel to X-men Apocalypse. Who asked for this? And instead of hiring an experienced director with a unique vision and story to tell, they hire Simon Kinberg: a guy whose only directing credit was overseeing reshoots on Fant4stic. And what\u2019s Kinberg\u2019s plan? He wants to do Dark Phoenix again, a story he already fucked up once in his The Last Stand screenplay 13 years ago. So it\u2019s a sequel nobody wants, from a first time director, it\u2019s telling the same story as the movie that killed the franchise 13 years ago, and it\u2019s going to cost at least $200 million to make.\n\nThat entire paragraph is one giant red flag.\n\nWhy did Fox greenlight this movie?

The only exception I'll make is First Class, but even that is nowhere near a proper performance. Then again, I can't stand her in any film. Her peformance is never convincing to me.\n\nBesides that, they fucked up Mystique in the reboots. She's supposed to be a complex, but sinister character. They could've gotten so much out of a Mystique, Rogue and Gambit combo, who each have their own interesting stories, but also tie in perfectly together. Instead they didn't get past the surface level of \"here's a team of snowflakes with powers\", but they made it a generic YA story too (basically trying to farm the YA trend).\n\nTo me X-men's core is about a divided society, focussing on the unfair treatment of a minority. The powers were simply a story vehicle to showcase a perceived difference on both sides, where a solution isn't blavk or white. It's basically racism, but instead of just a cosmetic difference (which is a hard sell) the difference is literally life threatening (potentially). You're basically asking normal humans to live peacefully with nuclear weapons. It's a pretty brilliant way of telling a story with multiple sides, of which nobody is 100% correct. \n\nThat sets you up for perfect character focussed stories on all sides of the spectrum. Tell the story about a regular human that has been the victim of a bad mutant (showing why some rightfully fear them), a human that has been helped (showing the boon mutants can bring) and do similar stuff for mutants (one struggling with his immense power he needs to learn to control, another that's been the victim of abuse/discrimination etc). We can relate to all parties, which makes it compelling to see stories unfold and intertwine. E.g. what happens when an anti-mutant human discovers his best friend is a mutant? He would be angry and conflicted.\n\nTL;DR: to tell a good X-men story, you need to tap into the dark reality that people are afraid of differences, especially when they can have lethal consequences. Make us care about all sides by way of characters from all sides.

The changes it makes are part and parcel of the plot of the story, and built in to the story itself.\n\nRetcons, in the sense they had when the term was coined for the comic book medium, are when the \"changes\" aren't changes within the plot at all. They're simply changes that the writer insists aren't changes at all, the \"oh, it turns out things were *this way* the whole time\" line at the beginning of the new storyline. \n\n\"Turns out, Mystique was Charles' adopted sister all along\" makes no fucking sense in the context of the 1st X-Men movie, and there's no mechanism employed to explain how they possibly could've gotten from the relationship in First Class to the non-relationship in the 1st movie.

Some of the gadgets he used and the stuff he accomplished was nuts, for sure, but it all felt like it wasn't out of the realm of human possibility.\n\n\nOn an emotional level, he felt human. Even with the switching of actresses, from Holmes to Gyllenhaal, the entire feel of the universe felt human. They also took the time out of the three movies in Batman Begins to set up his rise to power and his story for those movies fantastically. I don't remember Batman Begins being a huge box office smash, but I think that's just hindsight distortion because of how much The Dark Knight smashed everything.\n\n\nThese things, to me, is something that the new Justice League Batman and the other heroes were missing.
