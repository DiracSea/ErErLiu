[{"body": "It's a miracle that Blade Runner 2049 exists at all, especially considering the talent behind it.  I never much wanted a sequel but when I read that Denis Villeneuve, Roger Deakins, and Hampton Fancher were involved (plus the fact that it is a direct sequel and not a reboot...hallelujah), that was all it took to get me on board.  I had mega high expectations.  It delivered.\n\nIt really sucks that it didn't make money, but neither did the original.  I don't think we need another sequel.  We DO need more sci-fi films with substance, but if nobody's showing up then odds are we'll be lucky to get something like again this anytime soon.  Box office bomb or not, I'm so happy it exists that I saw it twice over the weekend.  I haven't watched a film twice during the theatrical run in over a decade.
