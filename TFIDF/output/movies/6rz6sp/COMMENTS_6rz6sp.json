On your comment about which of the two dies or both Evans is confirmed for a Avengers 4, whereas RDJ isn't (yet). Also something I didn't think about before, with how Civil War ended, having Stark die, would give Cap a very good incentive to \"come back to good side\".\n\nMe saying Vision dies in Avengers 4 is partly selfish and partly cause I think the characters needs to shine before getting killed off, honestly, he hasn't done that much and the character is supposed to be freaking strong, though I could also see them having him shine in IW and dying at the end.\n\nAlso something to note, it appears that Hela leaves behind the Tesseract in a ruined Asgard and Loki finds it, now Loki COULD bring it to Thanos, though seeing as what he wants is to rule Asgard (which is now in ruins) that's a bit less likely. And if they go with Hela taking the place of Mistress Death, Loki would be wise to watch his back, because he would have two strikes against him with Thanos.", "created_utc": 1502064902.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dl9f69f", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6rz6sp", "parent_id": "t1_dl9dc4z", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6rz6sp/guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol_3_will_mark_end_of/dl9f69f/", "score": 10, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "xclame", "author_id": "c4b7j", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I really hope vision doesn't die but when the stone is pulled from him he turns all white like his original comic appearance.", "created_utc": 1502074479.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dl9mgm0", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6rz6sp", "parent_id": "t1_dl9dc4z", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6rz6sp/guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol_3_will_mark_end_of/dl9mgm0/", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Alpha_Omegatron", "author_id": "e15vw", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Rabagers, rabagers, drive them from our shore!
