Movies are a business and studios aren't going to fund something that they're not going to make money on. $150 million is an insane amount of money to spend on anything, let alone something so niche, by a director who is hit-or-miss, financially speaking.\n\nA lot of people are saying that the studios should trust Del Toro because of his history as an incredible filmmaker and they should trust the source material as something that people are familiar with. However, even assuming that most people are familiar with Lovecraft (and most people certainly are not), this isn't always a surefire thing. Look at 2017's King Arthur: Legend of the Sword. A King Arthur movie directed by Guy Ritchie. What could go wrong? People are familiar with Arthurian legend and Guy Ritchie has made some amazing films (Snatch, Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Sherlock Holmes, etc.). The film cost about $175 million (a tad bit more than Del Toro's proposed AtMoM), but only made back an unimpressive $39 million domestically. It was a total financial failure. Even though Ritchie is a talented director with a good amount of critical and financial success under his belt, the movie failed. \n\nI think a lot of people are overestimating the popularity of both Del Toro and Lovecraft. I'm a gigantic fan of both of them, but they're wayyy more niche than the typical redditor might realize. I mentioned the King Arthur situation because Guy Ritchie is similar. He's a super talented director with a following, but unknown to the general public (he's not Spielberg or Nolan, so they don't know him). *Plus* he had the added benefit of people actually *knowing* what King Arthur is, unlike Del Toro's Lovecraft film.", "created_utc": 1520478294.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dvcv95a", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_82ruyz", "parent_id": "t1_dvctgxv", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/82ruyz/let_guillermo_del_toro_finally_make_at_the/dvcv95a/", "score": 11, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "PM_Me_Clavicle_Pics", "author_id": "hk5rp", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "In the Mouth of Madness wasn't written by Lovecraft, just heavily inspired by it.", "created_utc": 1520475361.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dvcsm1k", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_82ruyz", "parent_id": "t1_dvcpg5y", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/82ruyz/let_guillermo_del_toro_finally_make_at_the/dvcsm1k/", "score": 38, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "ChinatownHustler", "author_id": "78l94", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Is John Dies at the End Lovecraftian?

For me, it's possible to create the same sense of fear and tension using light, framing, and sound. Lack of light, how a shot is framed, and the sound (not just the music, but the sound or lack thereof) can create a scene of tension and suspense without any words. Take a look at [Curve](https://www.shortoftheweek.com/2017/06/19/curve/). This horror short has no dialog. There is no monster. It's all sound and visuals. The bleak sky, the bright red against the dark concrete, and the blackness of the gaping void all create horror and tension without a word or a monster. You're drawn in to the feeling of desperation and despair that the woman is feeling. It's an excellent example of exactly what it seems you think is missing from horror.\n\nAlso just a plug for shortoftheweek.com in general- there is some **solid** horror in there.

So there's been some backpedaling about their whole \"torch the company and run\" approach to exiting the console market, especially since Bomberman did well as a Switch launch title.\n\n\nThey also apparently smack-talked former employees when they applied for new jobs elsewhere and sold save slots in Metal Gear Survive, so, you know, real quality people.", "created_utc": 1520482796.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dvczbii", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_82ruyz", "parent_id": "t1_dvcrly8", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/82ruyz/let_guillermo_del_toro_finally_make_at_the/dvczbii/", "score": 15, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "totesathrowaway11", "author_id": "16ik3g", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Actually not really anymore, some new legislation tanked their earnings, that's why they're crawling back to games now.", "created_utc": 1520479596.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dvcwf4t", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_82ruyz", "parent_id": "t1_dvcrly8", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/82ruyz/let_guillermo_del_toro_finally_make_at_the/dvcwf4t/", "score": 11, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "cbad", "author_id": "4q8f3", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "For Konami?

It relays that theme through both gameplay and story. \n\nStory-wise, Bloodborne features several factions who seek knowledge through different means. Some take a scholarly approach by focusing on \u2018seeing the world as it is\u2019 to the point of obsessing over literal eyes and exploring the catacombs beneath the city where the game begins. Others take a metaphysical approach that centers on \u2018eyes on the inside,\u2019 trying to ascend beyond humanity through different rituals and the like. \n\nBoth routes lead the groups and society writ large to psychological and social ruin, and the game takes great pains to show that the two approaches are not counterposed, but are in fact driven by the same doomed desire to make the unknowable known. \n\nGameplay-wise, the player gains a currency called \u2018Insight\u2019 for encountering or defeating the horrors borne of the groups\u2019 meddling. As the player gains more insight, new and horrible sights that were invisible become visible, and some enemies gain new attacks. The game becomes harder and more horrifying with high Insight. \n\nFurthermore, the game takes you to different \u2018Dreams\u2019 that are often only vaguely Euclidean, with some being warped and impossible versions of \u201creal\u201d areas. Again, the fuzzy barrier between consciousness and other psychological states is a very Lovecraftian motif. \n\nDoes the game succeed in terms of making some horrors literally unknowable or beyond comprehension? No, of course not because games are partially a visual medium. But it does do a great job of getting the mood and themes right, and its regarded as a near-immaculate instant classic because of how well it executes those aspects. \n\nAll of which is to say that in Del Toro\u2019s capable hands, Lovecraft has a lot of potential.

This may seem ridiculous, but the Hollywood reporter notes that in 2007 studios were spending $36 million on average marketing medium movies, comparable to The Fault in Our Stars or Tammy. $100 million worldwide for advertising a tent pole isn't a wild bet. \n\nAlso, studios don't get the same cut from overseas tickets. $100 million of your BO came from China, where studios only get 25% of the ticket price, which shaves off another $75 million and suddenly it just made $55 million. If we assume the other $210 million in foreign ticket sales earned a generous 50% average cut then another $105 has to be shaved off and suddenly we've fallen from earning $220 million to losing $50. And this is still generous because it assumes that the studio got to keep 100% of the US BO when in reality theaters would take a 40% cut of the films lifetime BO. If you look at more realistic ticket earnings the film might have lost $100 million dollars!\n\nOf course, this situation is complicated by the fact that Pacific Rim isn't an average movie. It's a multi-media franchise with plenty of opportunities for merchandising and cross-promotion. So the film itself can lose money in terms of ticket sales and still make money when you consider all the potential income streams.

I think you underestimate how ubiquitous Lovecraft is in pop culture. Besides that, del Toro's aesthetic has always been a little bit Lovecraftian- little wonder that in both Hellboy and Shape there is a Deep One (fish man).\n\nEdit: oh yea, and True Detective season 1 that everybody loved so much? Absolutely ***loaded*** with Lovecraftian themes and elements, *especially* the Yellow King and Carcossa. I mean the whole thing about an esoteric sex cult with horrifying rites that take place far from civilization in the heart of a savage wilderness (the sex tape that Rusty shows Woody Harrleson) is taken directly from The Call of Cthulhu and the \"tale of inspector LeGrasse\" part of the story where a Louisiana detective tracks his case into the depths of the bayou. Season 2, that people didn't like so much? No Lovecraftian elements. \n\n\nSecond edit: oh yea again, how about ever played this insignificant total flop of an unheard of indie game called Skyrim? Basically all the daedra in the game are Lovecraftian, especially Mehrunes ***Dagon***.  But yea I mean Skyrim was a mainstream failure, completely without commercial success or profitability. Completely. \n\n\nThird edit: another oh yea, Event Horizon was a Lovecraftian story, and so is the Cloverfield franchise. It's like those old \"how many Indians can you find\" pictures, the longer you look the more Lovecraft you find all the fuck over the place in main stream entertainment. \n\n\nFourth edit: oh yea one more time, the Alien franchise that nobody ever heard of and didn't spawn a franchise of blockbusters, comic books, toys, video games, and memorabilia spanning three decades\n\nFifth edit: oh yea revival tour, there's also the Necronomicon, the Book of the Dead, made famous primarily by the Evil Dead franchise (which is distinctly Lovecraftian) but was created for the Cthulhu mythos by Lovecraft. (Not written by Lovecraft tho- it was written by the Mad Arab Abdul Alhazred)\n\nSo please do forgive me if I think it's bullshit that Lovecraft is A) unknown, or B) commercially unviable.
