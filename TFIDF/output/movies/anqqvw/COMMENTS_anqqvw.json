For example, Roma. This film has bigger sound files than most war movies, and this was due to Alfonzo\u2019s demand to recreate his child hood entirely and project in a 3D space using Dolby Atmos. \nIf you see this film in a theater the way sound surrounds you and engulfs you is more transporting to the world than the shots are, and he did this on purpose because of how memory works in the brain. \n\nMany films with low budget will sit in a black screen or a shot of a scared face, and let sound tell you a scene that\u2019s happening outside of them, and boom! You are right there with that characters fear and anxiety, yet no monster or alien was scene. \n\nI understand that sound is often forgotten, and that\u2019s because it\u2019s invisible! It\u2019s the one category of film that you don\u2019t see on the big screen. \n\nWith so much for the eyes to feast on, you\u2019re generally spent before even thinking about discussing that which you don\u2019t lol. It\u2019s something all of us in the sound community accept because we still love what we do and make for our audiences! \n\nAs for why they aren\u2019t smashed into ONE category like lighting and camera for cinematography, is because those(camera&lighting) are tools used to capture the magic ON SET. Where as post depts like Editing and VFX also get categories. \nInstead of asking for sound to be smashed into an even smaller category, why not wonder why production sound mixing has been smashed into the post world of sound mixing for an Oscar ;)\n\nOh. I also climb dum_dums! Free Solo is astonishing, just saw it again in IMAX on Monday before heading to out to boulder, nothing like getting pumped before you get pumped! Lol. \n\nHave you seen The Dawn Wall yet? Letting the cameras get close without risk of death helps show some seriously insane moves from Tommy Caldwell. \n\nAnyway, that\u2019s my peace on the subject.

Instead we see the likes of Ferdinand, Captain Underpants, Despicable Me 3, and others get attention\n\nThe Academy did nominate *The Breadwinner*, *Loving Vincent*, *The Red Turtle* and *My Life as a Zucchini*. So 4 out of the 6 you mentioned. And only *Ferdinand* was nominated last year, meaning that *Loving Vincent* and *The Breadwinner* most likely took the spots above *Despicable Me 3* and *Captain Underpants*\n\nIn terms of the categories one must remember that there's a difference between the films that are nominated and the ones that win. The five nominees are voted on by the animated branch in The Academy, which is why we often get some smaller foreign films in the mix. (Hence the examples above). That's the first phase. The film that wins the award is voted on by the **entire Academy**, many of them that don't care much about this category and go with the one their kids liked. Aka Disney/Pixar. \n\n\nOf course there are a lot of films that the animated branch didn't nominate. *Your Name* is a terrific example. One of my favourite films of the last decade. And they must have something against anime, since it's usually very underrepresented in this category. And of course you had the whole debacle on why they didn't nominate *The LEGO Movie*. \n\nThe point is that the winner and the five nominees are voted a little differently.", "created_utc":
