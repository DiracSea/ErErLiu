He is the first Superman knockoff and not only preceded Superman in say flying but was actually the most popular superhero of the 40s. Elvis was a big fan and based a lot of his outfits off Captain Marvel Jr. (that's the kid with the crutch btw) the Big Red Cheese's superpowered sick kick who transformed by saying \"Captain Marvel\" for maximum hilarity. (There's also Mary Marvel, but she gets to say \"Shazam!\" only it spelled with goddesses so its different)\n\nAnyways back to the story eventually DC Comics decided they didn't like this obvious IP infringement stealing all their thunder and sued Fawcett Comics. \n\nIt ended sort of indecisively because the Golden Age of Comics ended with the bottom falling out of the market. IIRC Fawcett won a Pyrrhic victory in court but DC might have appealed and so they settled as Fawcett was closing down their superhero line. In the agreement was that they would never publish Captain Marvel again. \n\nFast forward a few years to the Silver Age of Comics and suddenly superheroes are hot shit again. Fawcett still owns the property but can't publish it. But you know who *could*? DC comics of course! And so the characters were licensed to DC and became (sort of) the DC line. This would eventually evolve in the DC Multiverse to the main universe being Earth-1 and the Fawcettverse being Earth-S. Meanwhile Fawcett would go out of business entirely and their assets would be snapped up by DC fully. \n\nWhere does Marvel Comics enter the picture? Well they'd been around since the 40s too as Timely Comics under which they created Namor, Captain America, the original *robot* Human Torch, and some others nobody cares about. Anyways sometime before Fantastic Four started they rebranded as Marvel comics. Said team unlike their movies were actually fantastic and launched Marvel as a major player in the Silver Age.\n\nNow through all the legal shenanigans between Fawcett shutting down and I think some changes in the law itself maybe... their *trademark* to Captain Marvel had lapsed. Since Marvel Comics was shitting out characters right and left and well Captain **** is just sort of comics tradition... well why not increase their branding with a Captain Marvel. Specifically this is Captain Mar-Vell (geddit) of the Kree Imperial Militia, a friendly alien from Space Rome. He was never a big name (seriously his most siginficant story is when he got Space Cancer) but Marvel Comics has never allowed the trademark to lapse since. \n\nHowever since DC/Fawcett did but still have their original *copyright*, because the law has different types of intellectual property, they can still publish the character. They don't call any publication Captain Marvel not because there's any law that says they can't per se but because it would bring an immediate lawsuit from Marvel Comics for trademark violation. Not even necessarily because Marvel is a bunch of assholes but because one of the quirks of trademark vs copyright can be that if you don't defend a trademark (knowingly) then you can lose that protection.\n\nSo you had for some decades DC's Captain Marvel published under varying titles (mostly something something Shazam!) and Marvel's Captain Marvel occasionally published as Captain Marvel though so help me never for very long. \n\nEventually though DC kinda-sorta gave up the ghost and renamed Captain Marvel Shazam for real, meanwhile Marvel decided that none of their Vell's had worked out and decided to aggresively rework Carol Danvers aka Warbird aka Ms Marvel.", "created_utc": 1532221282.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e2t53t5", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_90rlfl", "parent_id": "t1_e2t14a9", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/90rlfl/shazam_official_teaser_trailer_hd/e2t53t5/", "score": 78, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "SolomonBlack", "author_id": "oea0f", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Ok, so DC's Captain Marvel used to be part of Fawcett comics(a company that went defunct in the 80s) in 1939.

It seems that Marvel only had interest in trademarking the name because of the Marvel part and speculation that DC wanted to revive the series (which was true), because they didn't publish any Captain Marvel comics for a few years. The reason at the beginning the Captain Marvel title kept getting passed around between characters was because Marvel had to publish comics using the trademark otherwise they lose it. After Marvel acquired the trademark DC revived the series, however using the name Shazam (since Marvel owns the name Captain Marvel now). I believe they were still able to call the character Captain Marvel, but the comics themselves had to be called Shazam.
