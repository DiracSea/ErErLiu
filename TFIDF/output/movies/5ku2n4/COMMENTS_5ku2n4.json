Some good examples:\n\nDepression:\n\n>  For example, in antidepressant clinical trials, it has been shown that the natural history of the disease (ie, spontaneous remission) accounts for 23.87% of the overall effect, the real placebo effect (ie, expectations of benefit) for 50.97%, and the drug effect for 25.16% only (Kirsch and Sapirstein, 1998).\n\nParkinson's Disease:\n\n> In this study, Parkinsonian patients were aware that they would be receiving an injection of either active drug (apomorphine, a dopamine receptor agonist) or placebo, according to classical clinical trial methodology. After placebo administration, it was found that dopamine was released in the striatum, corresponding to a change of \u2a7e200% in extracellular dopamine concentration and comparable to the response to amphetamine in subjects with an intact dopamine system.\n\nSuppressing immune system:\n\n> For example, Goebel et al (2002) provided convincing evidence that behavioral conditioning of immunosuppression is possible in humans. Repeated associations between cyclosporine A and a flavored drink induced conditioned immunosuppression in healthy male volunteers, in which the flavored drink alone produced a suppression of the immune functions.\n\nNocebo effect:\n\n> The best evidence that anxiety takes part in placebo responses is shown by the nocebo effect, which is opposite to the placebo effect. To induce a nocebo effect, an inert substance is administered along with negative verbal suggestions of clinical worsening, for example, pain increase. A study by Colloca et al (2008) used a nocebo procedure, in which verbal suggestions of painful stimulation were given to healthy volunteers before administration of either tactile or low-intensity painful electrical stimuli. This study showed that these anxiogenic verbal suggestions were capable of turning tactile stimuli into pain, as well as low-intensity painful stimuli into high-intensity pain. \n\n", "created_utc": 1482985932.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1482986392.0, "id": "dbqt58h", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_5ku2n4", "parent_id": "t1_dbqs0kf", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/5ku2n4/debbie_reynolds_dead_at_84/dbqt58h/", "score": 245, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "MasonM", "author_id": "316h1", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "My beloved fiancee died in January this year, I've been praying for a lightning strike since.  \n\nIt's gonna happen.", "created_utc": 1482985293.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dbqsqve", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_5ku2n4", "parent_id": "t1_dbqs0kf", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/5ku2n4/debbie_reynolds_dead_at_84/dbqsqve/", "score": 48, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "MetaTater", "author_id": "rzccf", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "i remember when i lost my great grandmother years ago. my great grandfather shortly followed :(", "created_utc": 1482986252.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dbqtcax", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_5ku2n4", "parent_id": "t1_dbqr522", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/5ku2n4/debbie_reynolds_dead_at_84/dbqtcax/", "score": 6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "clothes_are_optional", "author_id": "5n8ks", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Poor Jeb!.", "created_utc": 1482981386.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dbqq5xv", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_5ku2n4", "parent_id": "t1_dbqpyhp", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/5ku2n4/debbie_reynolds_dead_at_84/dbqq5xv/", "score": 30, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "SutekhThrowingSuckIt", "author_id": "rs4y3", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "But it comes with a free topping!", "created_utc": 1482981284.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dbqq3i6", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_5ku2n4", "parent_id": "t1_dbqpkai", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/5ku2n4/debbie_reynolds_dead_at_84/dbqq3i6/", "score": 102, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "centipededamascus", "author_id": "6jsjm", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "...Where his eldest son, Teddy Roosevelt Jr., died of a heart attack a few days after fighting in Normandy.", "created_utc": 1482997455.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dbqyvp4", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_5ku2n4", "parent_id": "t1_dbqq5f7", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/5ku2n4/debbie_reynolds_dead_at_84/dbqyvp4/", "score": 8, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "tintinabulations", "author_id": "cujhr", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Wow that sounds like quite the show.
