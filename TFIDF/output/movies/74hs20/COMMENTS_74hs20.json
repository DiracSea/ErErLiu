However, this is not the first time the Weinsteins -- specifically Harvey -- have been accussed of this manner of action.  Director Richard Stanley had cast actress Stacey Travis in his debut film _Hardware_.  He had wanted her for his sophomore film _Dust Devil_, but was not allowed to cast her.  The following is from the Espoo Cin\u00e9 Interview with Richard Stanley ( a transcript is available at http://www.everythingisundercontrol.org/nagtloper/iviews/cine1.php )\n\n\nRS:  Yeah, it's mostly set in the Zone.  I got tired of the city, I always meant to shoot it in Arizona or somewhere.  Jill [character from _Hardware_ played by Stacey Travis] is technophobic and is trying to live close to the soil.  She's stopped fixing sculptures; now she's mostly fixing tractors and combines.  And Shades fails to hook up with them and gets caught in the situation where a bunch of fleeing Mexican characters take shelter with the dirt farmers and they end up leading the droids to them. Those freaks are all pacifists and want no part in helping the Mexicans.  They're also very bad doctors; they don't believe in normal medicine, so they try to treat the Mexican character with different herbal remedies, but his leg gets gangrenous so they cut his limbs off.  So the hippie doctors and witches are not very helpful.  And then they end up besieged by the droids, and Stacy has to revert to her character, to actually fight at the end.  And I was planning to do terrible things to her because I fought to have her in another movie, she was in a position where she was forced to do things that are even worse than in the first film.\n\nBDD:  She was supposed to be in Dust Devil?\n\nRS:  Miramax wouldn't let her cause she wouldn't mess around with Harvey [Weinstein].  Harvey tried to get into her hotel room and she phoned with my hotel and asked \"What should I do?  I didn't let him in.\"  And they asked her to do a Playboy spread and she refused that, too, and they never let her work again which is very annoying. She's only now started showing in some small parts.\n\n\nIf more comes to light in regard to the McGowan story you may want to reach out to Stacey Travis and/or Richard Stanley.  Also, I would like to note that Travis did continue working, but more television work than anything else.  And in 2005, fifteen years after _Hardware_, she did have a film that she appeared in -- _Venom_ -- that was distributed by the Weinsteins.  Although I believe they did not finance it, but rather only picked it up for distribution.", "created_utc": 1507245348.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1507248836.0, "id": "dnytmm5", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_74hs20", "parent_id": "t3_74hs20", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/74hs20/decades_of_sexual_harassment_accusations_against/dnytmm5/", "score": 64, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Sablefool", "author_id": "14gtam", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I am Jack's complete lack of surprise.", "created_utc": 1507232895.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dnyifz4", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_74hs20", "parent_id": "t3_74hs20", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/74hs20/decades_of_sexual_harassment_accusations_against/dnyifz4/", "score": 115, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Buckaroosamurai", "author_id": "5qsvz", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Well shit Entourage was onto something", "created_utc": 1507230255.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dnyfvz4", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_74hs20", "parent_id": "t3_74hs20", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/74hs20/decades_of_sexual_harassment_accusations_against/dnyfvz4/", "score": 31, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "dawgfan24348", "author_id": "hoowx", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Not that I condone the sexual harassment but I'm glad he's getting done for it.
