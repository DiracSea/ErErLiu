Over 80% of the images you see on Ikea's website and print materials are 100% digitally created, the same goes for many other companies as well.\n\nThe reasons are multi-fold:\n\n1. It's cheaper (no shipping of products, building a set, location fees, no crew, etc.)\n2. It's faster (no location scouting or prop shopping and no limited time window to shoot)\n3. It's easier to edit or simply change hundreds of SKUs and hit render vs. switching and photographing hundreds of products\n4. Prop replacements are endless and literally seconds away by downloading\n4. You can do things impossible with traditional photography (such as recreating a location that would be impossible to install a customer's products or even creating an environment that doesn't exist)\n\nEven high-end designers (those folks who make furniture, lighting and textiles you see in Architectural Digest) \nwho have long argued that traditional photography captures their products better are finally coming around and making the transition to full digital creation of their products as well.\n\n20 years ago it was mostly cars and cellphones that were created digitally.  These days products of all kinds are being created digitally and the trend is continuing to expand.\n\nThat's a very well made and rendered scene.  The plants could use some work though.

As an example, I'm 99% convinced that most of the movie Fight Club can be distilled down to the scene where Jack finds his power animal. If a scene were central to a movie, you could have different parts of the scene connect to other important parts where objects pull up those movie scenes. (For example, you could have a scene from inception where the main character is spinning his totem, if you interact with the totem, you could see scenes of him and his wife.

You're not going to pull off something like OP in your first week. You're going to suck. Get over it and keep practicing.\n\n* Most 3D software can do many things, which is why newbies get overwhelmed trying to do everything. Nobody will hire you because you're just okay at everything, so be great at one thing. Maybe your texturing skills aren't perfect, but you can still be a fantastic modeler. Maybe you just can't get the hang of modeling, but you're really good at compositing. Maybe you're crap at compositing, but you have a head for animation, etc...\n\n* Don't get hung up on tutorials. They're great for learning the ropes, but learning how the tools work is more important than learning specific objects.\n\n* MODELING - Making an entire scene is cool, but learning to create single objects quickly is more useful. Pick a random object and set a timer for one hour. If you can't finish it in an hour, figure out why. Which parts of the model are giving you trouble? Try it again. Then try to halve your time. Then halve that time.\n\n* MODELING - Learn what edge flow is, then look closely at the model you're most proud of. Fix it, it's terrible.\n\n* UNWRAPPING - Sucks. It never becomes fun. You still have to do it.\n\n* TEXTURING/MATERIALS - Nothing in the real world is ever truly clean.\n\n* ANIMATION - You need to learn how to draw, or at least sketch. You can animate in 3d without knowing how to draw if you try hard enough. You can also drive a car with your feet if you try hard enough. Don't be the person who drives with their feet.\n\n* RENDERING - Is an entire field of study that many artists will never need to know. It is also expensive. Don't invest money in amazing hardware unless you're absolutely sure it's worth it. Instead, learn how to optimize your render for even the slowest potato. HINT: You shouldn't have the entire scene in a single layer.\n\n* Finally, read the friggin manual. Some people say Blender is confusing. Those people have not read the manual. Again, you don't have to know everything, just the parts you use. Bookmark it. It solves 90% of the problems newbies have. The other 10% can be solved with a Google search. \n\nIf you're interested in Blender, come to /r/Blender and don't be shy. We're happy to help.

Some lighting you see in games will be pre-baked, which can take hours to calculate upfront, but can then be used in realtime. Only drawback is once it's baked, it's set. You can't change it but you can get some really professional-looking results with it. It works great for games where you're not concerned about time of day changing.\n\nBut games with day/night cycles are also looking crazy impressive. Check out any time lapse videos of Forza Horizon 3 to see the kind of lighting we can currently get even in an open-world game. Also some of the mods people are using on games like Skyrim and GTA5. Some of them run like ass even with an amazing PC, but there are plenty out there now which look incredible at playable framerates.\n\nEvery so often a new game just comes along that completely raises the bar on a technical level, without even needing extra horsepower. People love to bitch about consoles and their lack of power vs PC, but it's due to these restrictions that developers keep coming up with ridiculous optimisations and new trickery that allows them to push these machines to their absolute limits.
