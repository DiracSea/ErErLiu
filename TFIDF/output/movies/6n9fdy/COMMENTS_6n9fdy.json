So now I'm wondering why I distinctly remember the word svelte being used to describe her.\n\nEdit: One of the things that stood out to Wade was the fact that Artemis looked exactly the same in-game vs out-of-game, just sans the birthmark.  So I don't think I confused her avatar's physique for her physique because they are supposed to be the same.  The question is why I remember her being described as svelte when everyone else (including the wiki) remembers her being described as Rubenesque.  It's possible the book said she \"wasn't svelte\" or something to that effect, and I missed a word.  But I can't confirm until I have the text in front of me.\n\nSecond Edit: Got home and flipped through my copy.  She is indeed never identified as svelte at any point.

But of course the choices made by children and adolescents are strongly affected by the family and community environments in which they live. Impoverished living conditions matter especially for the young, because they throw up many barriers to engaging in healthy behaviors.\n\n**Poor families have limited food budgets and choices**, and must often stretch supplies toward the end of the month, before another check or allocation of Food Stamps arrives. This leads to unhealthy behaviors in several ways:\n\n* Families choose high-fat foods dense with energy \u2013 foods such as sugars, cereals, potatoes and processed meat products \u2013 because these foods are more affordable and last longer than fresh vegetables and fruits and lean meats and fish. \n\n* Poor families often live in disadvantaged neighborhoods where healthy foods are hard to find. Instead of large supermarkets, poor neighborhoods have a disproportionate number of fast food chains and small food stores providing cheap, high-fat foods.\n\n* Economic insecurity \u2013 such as trouble paying bills or rent \u2013 leads to stress, and people often cope by eating high-fat, sugary foods. \n\n**Options for regular physical activity can also be restricted for poor people**:\n\n* Families cannot usually afford to pay for organized children\u2019s activities outside of school \u2013 and schools in impoverished areas are less likely to run sports or physical activity programs than schools with more resources. \n\n* Due to inflexible work schedules, lack of transportation, or unmet needs for child care, poor parents, especially single mothers, may find it hard to support extra activities for their children. Leaving kids in front of the TV is often all stressed poor parents can manage.\n\n* In many poor neighborhoods, parks, playgrounds, trails, and free public gyms are often not available or safe. Neighborhoods may be crime-ridden, and there may be no nearby indoor places for play or exercise.
