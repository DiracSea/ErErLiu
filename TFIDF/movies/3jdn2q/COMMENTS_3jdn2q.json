Johnson was the Vice President to John F. Kennedy and ascended to the presidency in 1963 after the assassination of JFK. LBJ is well-known for his vision of \"The Great Society,\" which was America's second great move to take care of the impoverished and sick, it was a massive expansion of safety nets in the American system (the first introduction of these systems was under Franklin Roosevelt).\n\nLBJ is the one who coined the term \"War on Poverty.\" He got the programs [Medicare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_\\(United_States\\)) and [Medicaid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid) passed, he expanded Social Security. He was also instrumental in passing the [Civil Rights Act in 1964](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964), that was pushed for by Martin Luther King and Malcom X.\n\nToday, LBJ is viewed as a supremely popular president. Especially in a modern context, many contemporary comparisons are made between LBJ and Barack Obama since they are both Democratic Legislative Politicians (meaning politicians who came from the Senate as opposed to Governors) who were leaders of the country when politics were incredibly divided.\n\nHowever, LBJ left office as a tainted figure. He was incredibly unpopular at the time because he greatly expanded the United States' involvement in Vietnam. [This might sound familiar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American-led_intervention_in_Iraq_\\(2014%E2%80%93present\\)). LBJ was eligible for a second term but declined to run because he believed he wouldn't win and would damage the Democratic Party's chance of holding the presidency.\n\nBONUS TRIVIA: LBJ declining to run led to the 1968* elections where originally Hubert Humphrey (LBJ's Vice President) and Robert Kennedy were running for the nomination. Robert Kennedy was making major gains on Humphrey and was seen as the party favorite since he was very popular among black voters in the south, however [Robert Kennedy was assassinated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Robert_F._Kennedy) before the primaries. Humphrey was the Democratic Nominee. The southern states were lost to a [third party candidate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Wallace), and the winner of the election was, to everyone's surprise, [Richard Nixon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1968).\n\nEdit: *I incorrectly had 1964 before, but it was 1968 when LBJ refused to run again.", "created_utc": 1441219732.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1441220503.0, "id": "cuofazd", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_3jdn2q", "parent_id": "t1_cuocr5g", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/3jdn2q/bryan_cranston_as_lbj_in_hbos_adaptation_of_all/cuofazd/", "score": 108, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "He had a really big dick.", "created_utc": 1441217140.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "cuodmov", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_3jdn2q", "parent_id": "t1_cuocr5g", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/3jdn2q/bryan_cranston_as_lbj_in_hbos_adaptation_of_all/cuodmov/", "score": 48, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "padronr", "author_id": "g5q2m", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "This should be higher, I was so perplexed.

Here's how he handled his opponents: http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l7tzeoDt151qz99fl.png (Frank Underwood has this image on his wall in House of Cards, or at least in the first season.)\n\nSupposedly, during his presidency, when he was trying to pass the Civil Rights Act, there was a holdout in the Senate and LBJ told the senator that if he didn't vote in favor of the Civil Rights Act, that he would reveal that the senator had a black mistress.\n\nHe had an aquatic car. Looks like a normal car, but his water-tight, floats, and has tiny propellers under the rear bumper. He enjoyed bringing people to his vacation home, driving them around in it, and then veering into the lake without warning them that the car is aquatic.\n\nHe flirted with Jackie Kennedy/Onasis after JFK died. http://americanradioworks.publicradio.org/features/prestapes/jklbj.html\n\nSome of these could be apocryphal. After all, he was obviously very interested in creating a myth of bad assery around himself, but the photo shows that he was, at least on some level, an intimidator. In some ways, the myth (true or not) of LBJ is fun, but in other ways he was definitely an asshole. For example, the transcript with Jackie Kennedy/Onasis.
