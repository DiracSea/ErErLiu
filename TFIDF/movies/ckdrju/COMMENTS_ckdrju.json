Hold a beat.  We hear screams approaching.  Spidey appears and sets her on terra firma. She clings to him, looking down and around in wonder. He has put the world at her feet. She can't believe this is happening to her. In a dizzying down-angle we see how the suspension cables all meet radially at the top of the tower... like the treads of some vast spider web.  Peter and MJ seem to sit at the very center of the web, surrounded by the lights of the city.  It is a warm spring night.  And the moment is pure magic. She stands with her back against a girder, needing to feel something solid Spider Man stands before her, a perfectly formed male silhouette with a soothing low voice.*\n\n>**SM:** Courtship among the spiders is highly ritualized.  It varies from species to species. The male spider may circle the female, or wave his front legs... to signal that he is not prey.\n\n>*Spider Man moves in a hypnotic arc around her.  He raises his hands in a dance-like movement.  Lowers them.*\n\n>**SM:** The female usually signals her willingness by an uncharacteristic passivity.\n\n>*MJ takes a deep breath.  Her lip trembles.  Her knees are weak.  Her eyes, though, are steady, gazing at the\nsilhouette before her.  She doesn't move of speak.  He moves closer.*\n\n>**SM:** In certain crab spiders, such as Xysticus, the male will attach strands of silk to the female... tying her limbs...\n\n>*Spider Man moves his hand gracefully across her, and she sees the sheerest silk webbing glinting in the moonlight. First one wrist. Then the other.  Hypnotic movement in the moonlight.  Her arms are bound to the wall.  Her breathing gets more rapid.*\n\n>**SM:** Since the female can break free at any time, the bonds have only symbolic significance.\n\n>**MJ:** The male must be very bold... to take such liberties with the predatory female.\n\n>**SM:** Yes.  He is very bold.  But he must also trust her. (he moves very close) Close your eyes.\n\n>*He removes his mask and kisses her.  Their mouths very slowly and very sensuously devour each other. Peter and MJ are locked together.  He is mesmerizing, gentle, powerful.  He pushes up her skirt. They make love, high above the world.*\n\n\nThe fuck\n\nI'm pretty glad I didn't see that.", "created_utc": 1564630130.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1564630319.0, "id": "evnqmtn", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ckdrju", "parent_id": "t1_evni78u", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/ckdrju/the_spiderman_2002_twin_tower_teaser_that_i_got/evnqmtn/", "score": 75, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Goldfish-Bowl", "author_id": "dq83z", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "But they did that in [Spider-Man 3](https://images.app.goo.gl/gzypyTBZNhUFEiKx7)", "created_utc": 1564630103.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "evnql8r", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ckdrju", "parent_id": "t1_evni78u", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/ckdrju/the_spiderman_2002_twin_tower_teaser_that_i_got/evnql8r/", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Toxyoi", "author_id": "6j7y5", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Oh dear god", "created_utc": 1564626187.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "evnjjh7", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ckdrju", "parent_id": "t1_evnedho", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/ckdrju/the_spiderman_2002_twin_tower_teaser_that_i_got/evnjjh7/", "score": 16, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Apophyx", "author_id": "zldwh", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Talking about surprisingly relevant moments in movies, I watched *Network* recently, and [this scene](https://youtu.be/ZwMVMbmQBug) jumped out at me.
