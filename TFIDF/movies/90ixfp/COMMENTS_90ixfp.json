This is very similar to social media as all of a sudden people can communicate with everyone and hear all differing opinions of others.\n\n\n\n\nSo, what happened to society due to the printing press? Well, the immediate consequence was horrible. Turns out when people can hear MORE opinions, they actually become more factionalized and radical at first. This led to arguably the most violent time in the Dark Ages- the 16th and early 17th century.\n\n\n\n\nHOWEVER, increased communication also eventually led to the enlightenment, spread of humanism, and the European revolutions of the 18th+ 19th century that has shaped mankind for the better(democracy, inalienable rights, fall of the monarchy, religous freedom etc.). \n\n\nSo, essentially, the internet and social media will have immediately bad consequences that will probably last for our life time. In the long run however(we're talking over generations) it will be for the best. A good modern example of this is the Arab Spring: it gave the average people a voice to connect and start a movement.
