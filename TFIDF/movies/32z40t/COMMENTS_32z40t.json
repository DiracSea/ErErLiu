The shot of Superman holding the rocket over his head: On the rocket it reads \"POCKOCMC\", or \"Russian Cosmos\". So Superman is saving some Russian Cosmonauts. \n\n3. The man reaching up to Superman is dressed like a middle eastern'er, and there are no tall buildings. So, Superman saving the day in the middle east, Sahara, etc..?\n\n*But the WEIRDEST fucking thing is this:* \n\n****** \nThe shot of Superman in the entrance of some sort of bunker, there are black clad soldiers on either side of him, elite, almost in a scary way...all are wearing the Superman LOGO on their arms where a flag would normally go! *(Superman, to his credit, seems uncomfortable with this, as he does at the Mexican holiday)* But, to make this scene with the soldiers even creepier, all of the soldiers genuflect (kneel) before Superman, which today is reserved for religious purposes. That, the almost SS-like uniforms, just with an \"S\" instead of a Swastika...and you can see why Batman is ready to put Superman on notice. \n\nI. Can't. Fucking. Wait.

So...after 3 hours of watching, pausing.........finally. Found it:**\n\nThe scene where, what I assume is the Batplane, is banking sharply over what appears to be a port area. It's quick because the Batplane(?)'s wing yaws to the left exposing some shipping containers for a second before going to the next cut. If you can manage to pause the video right at that moment you can get a good look at a massive area full of shipping containers. How many? About tree fiddy. And hiding *behind* those shipping containers is some 7 foot tall prehistoric sea creature, guarding a pile of underrated gems. \n", "created_utc": 1429322126.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1429353094.0, "id": "cqg4hdu", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_32z40t", "parent_id": "t3_32z40t", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/32z40t/batman_v_superman_dawn_of_justice_official_teaser/cqg4hdu/", "score": 273, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "VanByNight", "author_id": "cs9na", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Do you guys realize that we're being treated to the most intimidating incarnation of batman ever on film, and he's fighting the most ripped version of superman that's ever been on film?

All the religious imagery talking about false gods and idols and whatnot is fantastic. They're taking what some people would literally consider the 2nd coming of Christ and giving him unimaginable power and they're not just making the citizens okay with it, like in Avengers. All the citizens are totally cool that \"hey! The guys just destroyed one of the biggest cities on Earth and we're totally cool with that! On top of Hulk wrecking Harlem a few years earlier! No biggie!\" No. DC is putting it in actual real-world situation instead of just referencing that battle in later projects (Iron Man 3, Daredevil). They're tackling huge philosophical questions about corruption and power. Like the army handcuffed, arrested, and questioned him in MoS, but in BvS, we see the army literally kneel before him out of fear (allusion that he's becoming Zod). And the writing?! Did you hear all of those dialogues? That writing is incredible!! \"Tell me: do you bleed? You will.\" \"Devils never come from the hell beneath us, but from the sky\" \"Everyone is fixed on what he CAN do, not what he SHOULD do\". This film is using serious metaphors and tackling serious question about god-figures and men of power. I think Chris Terrio saved this film based on just the 10 or 11 lines of dialogue we heard. And I think it's going to kind of make up for the downfalls in MoS which was all the people dying, they aren't just glossing over it. They're putting these characters in a real world situation, but it still looks like a good time at the movies. It feels like it's going to be really fun with the batmobile and batplane and stuff, but being totally real at the same time. I'm so unbelievably impressed with it I can't hardly stand it. Which is why I think this is going to join a list of only 4 other superhero movies that should win an Oscar, the others being Superman I, Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, and DOFP. The tone of this movie looks completely different than MoS too. Like to use a color metaphor, MoS was grey, and BvS is black and blue.
