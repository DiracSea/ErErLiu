[{"body": "**Description:**\n\nThe acclaimed documentary is an extraordinary look at the soldiers and events of the Great War, using film footage captured at the time, now presented as the world has never seen. By utilizing state-of-the-art restoration, colorization and 3D technologies, and pulling from 600 hours of BBC archival interviews, Jackson puts forth an intensely gripping, immersive and authentic experience through the eyes and voices of the British soldiers who lived it. Jackson recorded a special introduction to the film offering his perspective on why the film is important for audiences, who have never experienced WWI footage as anything but grainy black & white, and silent. Jackson opens a window to the past in a way that has never been seen or heard before, noting, \"Restoration is a humanizing process.\n\n**Release Date:**\n\nDecember 17, 2018\n\n**Rotten Tomatoes:**\n\n[98%](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/they_shall_not_grow_old) ", "created_utc": 1543707297.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "eavwyin", "is_submitter": true, "link_id": "t3_a283qz", "parent_id": "t3_a283qz", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/a283qz/new_poster_for_peter_jacksons_criticallyacclaimed/eavwyin/", "score": 2758, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "BunyipPouch", "author_id": "a1s4w", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Peter Jackson is brilliant, but to do what he did with this film is pure genius.
