They hover solidly around a seven. The older seasons tended to fluctuate more between a 6 and an 8 in my opinion - there was just more variety in quality. The reason why everyone remembers the old seasons is because there would occasionally be *that* episode that was a 12/10 and was just amazing. Homer at Bat, or the monorail, or even just the sweet episodes like Lisa's Substitute. They don't do *those* episodes anymore, and I think that's why the perception of the show's quality dropping exists. From average episode to episode, they're not much different.
