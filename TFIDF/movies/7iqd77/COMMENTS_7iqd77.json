Plus, Liam Neeson is quite a bit older than he was in the Phantom Menace, so while not impossible it would be odd for him to reprise the role of Qui-Gon Jinn.\n\nBut, with a 20 year gap between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope there is time for adventures for Obi Wan.  It could be that an Imperial Officer or Inquisitor discovers information about Luke and Obi-Wan has to stop him before he can take the information to the Emperor.  Or the settlement Luke is in could become the target of a crime syndicate and Obi-Wan has to fight them.  Or to tie the film into the sequels, Luke could catch the attention of someone affiliated with Snoke.  \n\n*Edit:  Thinking about it more, I think this idea would annoy some people but depending on how he is portrayed in the Last Jedi, I would enjoy seeing Obi-Wan face off against a young Snoke.
