You can like anime and still be successful watching it fairly often (no different than watching Netflix movies a lot). There is a large community of anime fans now so you aren't exactly an outcast for liking something at least tens of millions to hundreds of millions enjoy world wide. \n\nAnime does seem to be chasing the obsessed crowd though to the point I seriously question how I personally can enjoy it still. The fascination with young children makes me drop way to many series because it seems to cater not just to a young crowd but a crowd at times that is older fascinated with the young which I find creepy.  They likely are the ones that spend the money and capitalism drives anime like it does most other things. In the end though that is not all anime.

It is any obsession that leads to a detriment to social skills in the view of society at large. Computers, military, airsoft, etc or any activity can get you the label as Otaku. Anime is just probably the most common.\n\nI mean it seems to me you are inferring being an Otaku means you'll never pursue life in any other fashion which I think goes a bit beyond the more modern treatment of the term. Which is why I bring a corollary to 'nerdy'. Your term 'Neckbeard' is a good example. Seems to me in the West Otaku = Nerd is how it has been but now since 'nerdy' is more acceptable they've split a bit into Otaku and NEET like Nerd and Neckbeard have in the West.\n\nAlso having poor social skills is a very big gradient depending on your environment. Sometimes 'having poor social skills' is simply not being up on commonly society approved topics like music or sports. You'll be viewed negatively without a reasonable understanding. I mean some career paths are likely filled with people with less social skills, you don't get to the pinnacle of some fields without an unhealthy obsession for pursuing math, science, etc. Some do, most don't. In general though the East has less of a taboo on that type of poor social skills so Otaku just has a slightly narrower meaning because of cultural weights by what they deem unacceptable than Nerdy does in the West. Not that the terms themselves are much different.\n\nTo be fair I agree only a Neckbeard would refer to themselves as an Otaku with a sense of pride.
