So many movies are built around trailer moments and it's harder than ever to find something good. Not to mention the cinemas around me (heart of a big city in Australia) don't even show the movies I want to see, but absolute dreck I don't understand why it's even in the cinemas.\n\n- Annoying people.

It isn't hard to sit your ass down and shut up and watch a movie.\n\nI personally don't have Netflix either because I barely even watch stuff anymore, and what little I do I get from the high seas, and I go to the cinema maybe a couple times a year.
