This in and of itself would not be so bad, except that there was danger fast approaching in the form of who he recognized as the First Order\u2019s resident spitfire, Kylo Ren.\n\nFN-2187 had not yet seen Ren or his lightsaber before, but he recognized both the moment he saw him stomping down the hallway. FN-2187 used to think that Nines was laying it on thick when he described Ren\u2019s cataclysmic temper tantrums. He could see at that moment that there was no need for exaggeration. With the largest swipes of his blazing lightsaber, Ren roared at the walls like they had said something to personally offend him. The smell of melting durasteel filled the hall.\n\nFN-2187 stopped mopping the floor and stared a bit in awe before the realization set in that he was right in the way of Ren\u2019s warpath. Anyone else that may have been in the hall earlier had the sense to clear out. He dropped his mop and turned to run before belatedly remembering that Ren was coming from the only exit. FN-2187 turned back, feeling the all-too-familiar sweat start to build up on his forehead beneath his helmet. As if to emphasize the stormtrooper\u2019s doom, one of the wild lightsaber swipes hit the lights. The far dimmer emergency lights kicked in, but they only served to emphasize the ghoulishness of Ren\u2019s approaching figure.\n\nThere was only one choice. FN-2187 set his jaw. He would have to run and try to dodge by Ren. He waited until Ren got close, then made a break for it.\n\nHis plan\u2014though it was almost too simple to be called that\u2014fell through spectacularly. For, in his haste, he had forgotten about the area he had just mopped. FN-2187 only had time to let out a sharp, startled \u201cWhoa!\u201d as he slipped on the wet floor and then face-planted against the chest of the master of the Knights of Ren. Before he could fall the rest of the way, Ren dropped his lightsaber and caught him by his biceps. The lightsaber dropped to the ground with a clunk and hiss as it deactivated.\n\nFN-2187 started sweating even more then and his breathing bordered on hyperventilating. Dead. He was dead and he had not even seen battle yet. To his surprise, though, Ren did not throttle him right then and there. As a matter of fact, if FN-2187 had to best describe the way in which Ren wrapped his arms around him and clasped him against his black-clothed body in the next moment, he would say he was hugging him.\n\n\u201cU-uh. Lord Ren, sir?\u201d\n\nCrushed as he was against his superior officer, FN-2187 could plainly see the frayed quality of Ren\u2019s woven capelet with far more clarity than he ever wanted to. He attempted to extricate himself from Ren\u2019s hold, only to have Ren more or less crush him and lift him a few inches off the ground. FN-2187\u2019s air supply lessened as the already restricting armor cut further into his body. He ended up face-to-face with Ren\u2019s inscrutable helmet.\n\n\u201cBe silent and don\u2019t struggle if you value your life,\u201d Ren said, then added, as if to validate what he was doing, \u201cI need this.\u201d\n\nNeeded what? A bunch of plastoid stormtrooper armor digging into him through his cloth robes?\n\nIn an attempt at appeasing him, FN-2187 nodded. Mercifully, Ren set him down, making FN-2187 realize in the process how kriffing tall he was.\n\nAs if nothing had occurred, Ren went back to hugging him with the same fervor as before. FN-2187 tried to decide what to do with his hands, feeling awkward with his arms dangling at his sides. After much debate, he ended up settling them on either side of Ren at the hips, ready to pull back at a moment\u2019s notice.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t just do it halfway, trooper.\u201d\n\nAnd so FN-2187 ended up wrapping his arms completely around Kylo Ren\u2019s waist. They stood like that for a while. Ren\u2019s mask did not pick up the sound of his breathing, but FN-2187 could see the rise and fall of his broad chest right in front of his visor. It started out in harsh, quick swells with each breath, a testament to his residual anger and exertion from going berserk with his lightsaber, but slowly they became less pronounced and even as Ren relaxed.\n\nThe trooper\u2019s stomach turned over when Ren leaned down, adjusting his position to tuck his head over FN-2187\u2019s shoulder. Startled, he turned to look. The resulting clack of their helmets and Ren\u2019s reprimanding snarl had him looking forward again, this time over Ren\u2019s shoulder. He stared down the corridor, praying that no one important happened along and saw his predicament. The only witness to the spectacle ended up being a mouse droid working on a maintenance panel not three feet from them, who FN-2187 decided he trusted to keep a secret.\n\nMeanwhile, Ren used his fingers to investigate the slots between the pieces of FN-2187\u2019s armor where the body glove stood out. FN-2187 concentrated on trying not to flinch or giggle when Ren hit on the ticklish spots. Best not to chance that Ren would think he was laughing at him.\n\nMaybe it was one of Ren\u2019s mind tricks, but the longer the hug went on the more comfortable with the awkward and highly unprofessional situation FN-2187 became. He settled further into Ren\u2019s hold until he was all but boneless. The stormtrooper ranks did not offer many opportunities for public displays of affection beyond the occasional high-five or congratulatory punch on the shoulder. Although it was with Kylo Ren, FN-2187 could appreciate affectionate physical contact like this. It was one of the few times in his life he could remember receiving it.\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Leader does not believe me ready to complete my training,\u201d Ren said suddenly.\n\nEven with the voice scrambler, FN-2187 could hear the sulky quality to Ren\u2019s voice. That explained what he had been upset about, then, but FN-2187 was not sure that that explanation justified the level of havoc Ren had wreaked on his workstation.\n\nIn a misguided attempt at comfort, FN-2187 said, \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be ready someday\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not recall giving you permission to speak,\u201d Ren snapped. \u201cThat aside\u2026 even you, a lowly stormtrooper, do not think that I\u2019m ready.\u201d\n\nFN-2187 bit the inside of his cheek. Ren pulled his head back and stared him down for a moment. FN-2187 imagined he was probably glaring at him. It did not help that his helmet gave him a perma-angry look.\n\nThe hug ended in a less climactic way than it began. Ren shoved him away and turned on his heel to leave. His dropped lightsaber soared to his outstretched hand. FN-2187, after a moment spent gawking at his first experience with the Force, tried to muster up something to say.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you were just hugging me and not squeezing me to death\u201d? \u201cYou\u2019re really warm, you know, I could feel it through my gloves\u201d? Nothing he came up with seemed appropriate, so he let Ren keep walking. Oddly enough, though, Ren paused for a moment, back to FN-2187, and said something himself.\n\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\n\nFN-2187 blinked.\n\n\u201cI may be requiring your services again soon,\u201d Ren said, then continued on his way.\n\nServices? He made it sound like the hug had been a transaction. Or something incredibly sexual. Nevertheless, FN-2187 felt a small thrill at the idea of doing it again.\n\nAs soon as Ren was out of sight, FN-2187 uncrossed his arms from around himself, realizing with a twinge of embarrassment that it was an attempt to replicate the gesture from the enigmatic knight. The mouse droid, who had long since finished with its work, tittered in what FN-2187 could only assume was a mocking fashion.\n\n\u201cOh, shut up,\u201d FN-2187 grumbled, picking up his discarded mop and minding the area he had slipped on earlier.\n\nHe went back to work, wondering whether or not clean floors would matter next to the wrecked walls.\n\n", "created_utc": 1514568621.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "drwz9r4", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7mugpo", "parent_id": "t1_drwxzg2", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7mugpo/star_wars_franchise_crosses_4_billion_eclipsing/drwz9r4/", "score": 55, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "RIOTS_R_US", "author_id": "ve6ii", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Lmfao.

A deli with really good cold cuts and cheeses, not even talking about their fried chicken and subs because those are given. An in house sushi chef if your store has one that serves pretty damn good/convient sushi for a supermarket. Employees will ask if you need help unlike walmart where they avoid eye contact. Publix doesn't blare really dumb country/pop/rock music 24/7. Their produce is some of the most affordable while being the freshest around. They have a decent selection of local and niche products for sale as well. The store is clean/organized (no having to squeeze between an isle and a block of unstacked inventory to get to something). They have a nice return policy, if you don't like something you can literally just return it and they'll give you the money back but i'm sure most places have this.
