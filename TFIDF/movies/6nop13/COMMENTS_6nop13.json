He comes across some apparent drama, and since I'm so young and can't make since of much, leaves it on. What's the worst that can happen? \n\nWell, soon he is engrossed and forgets I'm on his lap. A cuckolded husband has buried his wife and the man she has been sleeping with up to their necks in sand. When they ask what to do as the tide rolls in, he tells them, \"You can hold your breath.\" \n\nApparently this was all fine, but what wasn't fine was when the waterlogged corpses return from the dead to wreak vengeance on the man who murdered them. My dad had been flipping back and forth between channels, so at the next World Series commercial break, here comes a seaweed covered, cyan, wrinkled raisin monster moaning, \"You can hold your breath.\" The extreme close up threw me into a howling terror of my own. My dad (who had no idea this was coming) flipped the television back over to a commercial and calmed me down by asking me questions about baseball. \n\nThe film in question was Creepshow, and I've since watched it many times as a teenager, and as an adult.

The concept of \"that isn't little Suzy anymore\" hadn't entered the collective consciousness. When viewers originally saw a daughter kill and eat a parent, that concept alone was objectively horrifying. The idea that someone would want to kill (whats left of) your daughter was a deep, emotionally intense concept. The concept that you might kill your daughter *before* they turned was mind bending, especially in days long before euthanasia and similar frank and practical concepts of death and dying were discussed or considered remotely reasonable by the average person.\n\nHeck, just the horror element of \"Us\" becoming \"Them\" was still fairly underutilized in film, and still had a lot of shock value to the average movie goer. Cannibalism and body horror warrant their own discussion too.\n\nBut things changed. Because of these films, but also because of the evolution of horror and changes in current events and public zeitgeist, these elements became less shocking, and played less to the latent fears of the populous. As an example, in the decades after his first film, America lost some of its racial, cultural, and spiritual unity. We were no longer shocked at the concept that our neighbor may be our enemy. The public opinion on the matter went from being shocked by the concept, to having a constant underlying suspicion, to being tired of being told to be afraid of our neighbors (but still being afraid of our neighbors.) He tried, with varying levels of success, to adapt his films to the changes in his audience, changes in the world, and changes in the way his audience viewed the world. \n\nIn short, the real horror in NotLD was not that you would die from some monster, but that society would break down and your closest allies would turn against you, and you would have to fight back. This became a tired trope both in movies and reality. Humanizing the zombies is meant to make you more emotionally conflicted by treating them as an enemy, and the other struggles the characters face are supposed to represent the horrors of reality at the time. Even then, these changes are only somewhat effective. In a world where many are salivating for a reason to turn on their fellow man, many modern zombie films can no longer have the same impact, even when dramatically retooled. The core concept is simply less disturbing.
