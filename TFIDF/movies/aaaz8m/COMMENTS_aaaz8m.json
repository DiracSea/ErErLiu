For example, they hired professional lip readers to transcribe what the soldiers in the footage were saying, they also hired professional voice actors to reconstruct the ambient dialog; for every step in the mud, gentle scrape of a shovel across the ground, the creak of a piece of wood, a plank displacing beneath a soldier's feet, it was all done externally and implemented into the footage. They even tirelessly dug through archives of documents in hopes of finding a piece of paper that someone was reading aloud in a snippet of footage, just so they could be as accurate as possible.

The opening 15 minutes or so are just unrestored footage and narration detailing the outbreak of war, people signing up and getting to the \"front\" and the moment they reach the front, the footage transitions from the small black and white to the full colour, smoothed out restored footage and it's quite incredible to see. You genuinely forget that you're watching real footage from the day, and that the audio is overlaid as it's just so well done. \n\nIt's well worth anyones time.. either to learn about what those men went through, what they sacrificed for us, or just to appreciate the technological accomplishment. The audio itself deserves special mention as much as the video footage.. both the underlying soundtrack of battle which runs through a lot of the film, and the voice acting work, but also the original interviews.. some of them are really quite touching as well and it's amazing to hear their stories. \n\nhttps://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/they_shall_not_grow_old/", "created_utc": 1546016597.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1546016817.0, "id": "ecqnvgu", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_aaaz8m", "parent_id": "t1_ecqgsz3", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/aaaz8m/after_an_extremely_successful_limited_release_54m/ecqnvgu/", "score": 32, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "chicaneuk", "author_id": "abgcj", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Yes.
