He acted the shit out of the part, and made it his own, but his original casting was specious at best.\n\nLikewise, Magneto is supposed to be physically imposing.  He's the brawn to Xavier's brains.  That's their dynamic, and Sir Ian McKellen just doesn't fit into that dynamic. Of course McKellen is a great actor, worked with what he was given, and did a wonderful job.  He infused some true gravitas in the role for which I am grateful.  \n\nMcKellen I understand.  He is an established actor, so the casting department knew exactly what they were doing.  They went with acting chops over a physical match, and I respect that. But who the hell was Jackman before XMen?  He starred in a couple Australian TV Dramas.  No real reputation, no established chops.  He was basically *that one guy* from Aussie Dr. Quinn.\n\nCasting department rolled the dice here and got super lucky.\n\np.s.

I think it's important, at least from an art-meets-capitalism perspective, to recognize that Logan had the same lead actor and director as The Wolverine. \n\nI felt like The Wolverine was pure garbage from opening credits to end credits. And I was disappointed because the director, James Mangold, isn't prolific, but he's directed some really legitimate films (Logan, Walk the Line, 3:10 to Yuma, Identity, 'Girl, Interrupted', and Cop Land). It seemed clear to me that Fox taken the creative reigns from Mangold. A huge difference was that James mangold usually is a lead writer on the films he directs or he writes the screenplay for those films. That didn't happen with The Wolverine, but it did with Logan.\n\nGetting back to my initial point, Fox has seen the writing on the walls, and they know that if they keep paying people to make mediocre films, then they're going to completely lose their audience. Days of Future Past was just a *long* retcon device for the horrible and almost nonsensical overall stories that all of these films have told about these characters. \n\nFox had Hugh Jackman for one final film, they convinced another very talented stage actor (Sir Patrick Stewart) to come back and perform Xavier as a co-star again even though he had said repeatedly that he would only do cameos going forward. They let this fantastic writer/director work with the extremely talented cast as he would on one of his films with much smaller budgets and fairly low public expectations. \n\nIt turns out that it's possible to make a very artistically solid film that just happens to be about \"superheroes\". Also, it can have a \"hard R\" rating while feeling almost like an indie studio film, and turn a $250,000,000 boxoffice on just opening weekend sales. I think every film enthusiast who was ever into well written comics knew that this was absolutely possible. Maybe now Fox/Marvel, Sony/Marvel, and Disney/Marvel/Marvel films can feel a bit more free in taking chances in the future. I hope so because the alternative is that they just die off again.\n\nTL;DR - Logan was a good film with some superhero characters, not just a \"good\" comic book film.", "created_utc": 1488905839.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "demgv6b", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_5y0dwp", "parent_id": "t1_demewo6", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/5y0dwp/hugh_jackman_doing_adr_for_logan/demgv6b/", "score": 9, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "ChiXiStigma", "author_id": "343gg", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I do agree, I think one of the biggest things about the movie was Laura though, she was a terrific actress and played her role well.", "created_utc": 1488901970.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "demdje8", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_5y0dwp", "parent_id": "t1_demdam3", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/5y0dwp/hugh_jackman_doing_adr_for_logan/demdje8/", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Khrull", "author_id": "7b6tl", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I thought it was flow.
