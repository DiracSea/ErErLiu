Colors. Personality. Warmth. Wonder. What I suddenly longed for was a burst of hand-drawn animation. \n\nThis is not absent from CG animation. It can be incredibly stylized, fluid and lively and filled with personality. Spiderverse is probably the best recent example of this, and while a lot of that does come from the small touches drawn in on top of CG models, the CG itself is used extremely well. It's vibrant and filled with color, the movement is purposeful to not only the personality of the character but where they're at in a given scene (a character may be animated on one's in a scene where they're confident and in control, and on two's in one where they're uncertain and fumbling around).\n\nCG animation is also extremely difficult. From the way this article goes about talking about it, you'd think someone sits down at a computer and presses \"animate\". CG has someone specializing in just one area of the production pipeline because each of those areas is so highly technical and varied from one another. You need someone to design the character, model it, rig it, texture it, clothe it, do blocking/layout, animate, etc etc etc. 2d is not easy to do, neither is 3d. \n\nAnd here's the thing, when audiences are given supposedly exactly what they want, that being different types of animation other than CG that are stylized and visually interesting, they make no fucking money 9/10 times. Laika, if you include what they likely spent on marketing, has never made a real profit on any of their films. This 3d fatigue that should supposedly be getting worse must not be enough to drive audiences to these types of movies, because each subsequent Laika film has made less money than the one that came before it. If it weren't for the co-founder of Nike, Phillip Knight, propping up the studio, I really doubt it would have made a movie past Coraline, \\*maybe\\* Paranorman.  \n\nAnd there's no doubt some studio apathy or even borderline sabotage went into the degradation of movies like Treasure Planet, Princess and the Frog had a sizable marketing campaign and decently smooth production, and it only made about \\~$260 million world wide off a \\~$100 million budget.

Every movie practically looks the same. Spider-Verse was a breath of fresh air. \n\nI sorely miss hand-drawn animation when it comes to Western animation.

Animator\u2019s Desks could also be paired with other pieces of Weber furniture, such as a small paint table on wheels, whose top featured a circular indentation for a stoneware crock that artists would fill with water to mix and dilute pigments. There was even a portable Animator\u2019s Desk on wheels for directors, many of whom were former animators\u2014if a director was having trouble explaining what he wanted to an animator in words, he could always just pick up a pencil and communicate his vision in pictures.\n\n>Some of the coolest features of the\u00a0Animator\u2019s Desks, though, had nothing to do with the artistry and craftsmanship of animation, at least not directly. Consider the stainless-steel \u201ccigarette guard\u201d that protected the edges of certain shelves from burn marks, caused when animators would lay down a cigarette and then forget about it while they got lost in the details of a particular drawing. According to Bossert\u2019s book, cigarette burns had been a big problem on desks in Disney\u2019s Hyperion Studios, so much so that Weber included a stainless-steel cigarette guard in his design for the desks at the new studio in Burbank. (In 1939, the radical idea of going outside to smoke apparently did not cross anyone\u2019s mind.)\n\n>Other design touches performed dual roles. While the desk\u2019s recessed drawer pulls represented a handsome touch of Streamline Moderne for which Weber was so well known, they also made handy bottle openers for a late-afternoon beer. \u201cI opened many a bottle on my drawer pulls,\u201d the author confesses. Similarly, it was also apparently no accident that one of the desk\u2019s cabinets was just the right height for a bottle of Scotch.\n\nhttps://www.collectorsweekly.com/articles/disney-animator-desk/", "created_utc": 1563931309.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "euno2ca", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_cgv7lf", "parent_id": "t1_eumojs6", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/cgv7lf/bring_back_handdrawn_disney_animation/euno2ca/", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "JamesonWilde", "author_id": "crsuv", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Do tell...

People eat that shit up though\n\nI have a personal theory (no way to prove this) that the shot for shot remakes of the classic Disney movies are only liked because people are remembering the original movie in their minds when they watch the new movie. Take Lion King for example, Scar had no change in his tone of voice the whole movie. He is just always at full on \"I'm evil & sinister\" tone but people enjoyed it cause they're picturing the Jeremy Irons Scar acting out the words. Or the Mufasa death scene in the new movie has no emotion from Simba, Scar, or Mufasa's lion's on screen so people are picturing the super emotional imagery from the original. So if the original didn't exist I bet people wouldn't like the shot for shot remakes as much. Lion King especially I think is completely forgettable in this new form.
