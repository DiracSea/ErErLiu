If I've missed any let me know.\n\nEvil Dead (2013), Fright Night (2011), RoboCop (2014), The A-Team (2010), 21 Jump Street (2012), Baywatch (2017), The Karate Kid (2010), IT (2017), Miami Vice (2006), Conan the Barbarian (2011), My Bloody Valentine 3D (2009), Red Dawn (2012), Fame (2009), Dirty Dancing TV Movie (2017), Poltergeist (2015), Clash of the Titans (2010), Footloose (2011), Vacation (2015), Ghostbusters (2016), ChiPs (2017).\n\nThen you have horror movie franchise 'reboots' which are technically reboots but I consider these long running franchises so I don't feel they count. A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010), Halloween (2007), Friday the 13th (2009).\n\nI count 21. And a good chunk of them are horrors which are constantly being remade no matter what decade and have been since the dawn of cinema.\n\nSo yes, there are a couple of remakes being made from the 80's but there aren't nearly as many as people make out. And even then, if they bring a new spin to it, does it matter? I welcome them if they add something new. 21 Jump Street created a couple of hilarious movies out of a dead property. Evil Dead was a fantastic re-imagining of the original. RoboCop was an interesting portrayal of the militarization of America compared to the originals commercialism focus. IT looks like a truly scary movie compared to the original's goofy charm. Miami Vice was a darker, more realistic take on the cheesy TV show.\n\nAll I'm saying is, people take the un-originality of Hollywood way out of proportion. It may seem like there has been a rise in remakes recently but that's just because the 80's is writhe with money making properties, that doesn't mean the concept of remakes is anything new. Hollywood has always been making remakes, usually by just changing the title of the films to the original. (Yojimbo - Fistful of Dollars. Seven Samurai - Magnificent Seven. The Thing from Another World - The Thing. The Shop Around the Corner - You've Got Mail. The Virgin Spring - The Last House on the Left. Rio Bravo - The Assault on Precinct 13. The Lady Vanishes - Flightplan. Rear Window - Disturbia. Infernal Affairs - The Departed.) And then there are remakes which keep the title but are just re-imaginings. (The Wizard of Oz, Meet the Parents, The Ladykillers, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Brewster's Millions, The Bourne Identity, Psycho, The Man who Knew Too Much).\n\nI dunno, I just feel if you are going to criticize Hollywood just make sure your argument makes sense.", "created_utc": 1495916651.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1495917134.0, "id": "di4gafc", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6dob5f", "parent_id": "t3_6dob5f", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6dob5f/hollywood_is_running_out_of_hit_80s_movies_to/di4gafc/", "score": 17, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "MindCrypt", "author_id": "x8491", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I love how people still flip out about this shit. This has been happening for a long long long time. Hey 90s kids, remember when the 90s was all about bringing stuff back from the 60s and 70s. We had like Lost in Space, the Brady Bunch, Leave it to Beaver, 101 Dalmatians, Angels in the Outfield (yes that was a remake), Cape Fear, Maverick, Flipper, Flubber, The Nutty Professor, Dr. Doolittle, Homeward Bound, The Jackal, etc. etc. \n\nRemember when the 80s was like all throw backs to movies of the 40s and 50s? Remember all those awesome horror remakes from the 80s? The Thing, The Fly, and The Blob. Hell even Star Wars and Indiana Jones are taking from series that came a long time before them.\n\nThe thing is every generation of new directors were inspired by things from their childhood and they draw on that. These things we all love stick in peoples minds and creative people want to build on them.\n\nThe thing is you need the right people who were really inspired by them and have revernce and understanding for what made them great to remake them. The Thing and The Fly are remakes that are a better films not just because of better special effects but because they understood the true core of the stories of those films, they knew how those films got under their skin as kids and explored that.\n\nRemakes aren't bad because honestly a lot of films got cut short by either  bad initial release, short sightedness of the studios or even disinterest from the creators themsevles. I mean lets be honest a full fleshed out world of  Ghostbusters films actually sounds amazing to me. Something that is trying to build up an actual cool mythology like it was very capable of doing, and the TV show proved that this was the case. As much as you might hate remakes there are still some neat ideas to explore there. This is why I am glad things like Star Wars are actually getting a ton of spin offs and sequels because there are a lot of cool stories to tell there, and the talented creative people who were directly inspired by those films, love those films and characters, are the exact people who should be telling those stories.\n\nAs much as people hated the new Ghostbusters, the issue with that film isn't inherently an all female cast. It is that it was made by a man and team that didn't really understand Ghostbusters. They weren't coming from the same place  that Aykroyd and Ramis    were drawing from when they wrote that film. Aykroyd is a man who has knowledge of real occult stuff (well as real as that gets), he was drawing from true horror sources like HP Lovecraft. He was a fan of these things and it shows in that movie. He wasn't just making a ghost comedy movie, he was putting some of his actual ideas and beliefs into that film. Someone who makes a Ghostbusters remake should be someone more akin to Del Toro someone with a true understanding and appreciation of horror history and how to subvert that in a funny and clever way. \n\nSo No I don't hate remakes but they need to come from a place with a real appreciation for the material. Stranger Things is a series that *gets* what made stuff like King, Spielberg, and the 80s films and horror so special, it also had an understanding of horror as a this broad history (and yeah it takes from Lovecraft as well). \n\nSo go ahead and make a Back to the Future remake, but have someone who understands what that movie was really about. Don't just have it be pop culture references and shit like that because that isn't what made that film special to a little kid in the 80s like me who didn't know who the fuck Chuck Berry was at the time. It tapped in to something deeper than that. The punch McFly gives Biff means something to a lot of people who encountered bullies like that. \n\nBut seriously leave BttF alone.

It's not great, and I think it may have been a cathartic exercise just to try to get bad ideas and concepts out of my system. Anyway, here's some more of what you didn't ask me for.\n\nI have to start by saying that this was a movie that could have seriously benefited from some Jim Henson style puppet magic in addition to CGI. Also, I'm still at odds with the fact that the guy who played Spike looked and sounded *way more like Luigi* than John Leguizamo did.\n\nThe divergent world idea where reptiles evolved into the dominant species instead of primates wasn't necessarily awful, but the movie still could have included more major players from the franchise with better backstories.\n\nMario and Luigi would still share the same last name, but it wouldn't be \"Mario\". It would be something that translates to \"jump(ing)\" or \"bound(ing)\", but in Italian, so \"Saltando\" or \"Balzando\". Mario would own a moderately successful plumbing business, probably called something like \"Down the Tubes\" or \"Pipe Dreams\" or something kitschy that will stand out in the Yellow Pages. Luigi would be the manager of a struggling pizzeria called \"Luigi's Pizza\", but with the first \"i\" in the sign light broken, thus causing tourists who don't know any better to call it \"Loogie's Pizza\".\n\nSuffice to say, their first encounter would involve Luigi phoning Mario's plumbing company to report a strange leak causing the growth of weird looking, giant speckled mushrooms and strangely fanged plants. What neither of them realize yet is that they're actually long lost paternal twins who move in synchronicity with each other without realizing it. The strange fungi and plants are the result of an ongoing interdimensional collision that affects anyone closest to the thresholds by which one could travel from one universe to the other, which could explain why Mario and Luigi would be affected by items that would change their physical stature. The effects of the merger on the other dimension would manifest in augmenting the denizens of that world with appearances that more closely reflect their reptilian ancestors.\n\nBowser would be a munitions manufacturer, head of an international arms syndicate (possibly something with the word \"carapace\" in the title), and designer of the K.O.O.P.A. (Kinetically Operated Overclocked Power Armor) line of battlesuits that when worn would resemble the shells of the Koopa we know from the games. Like in the games (most specifically the effect the shells have when eaten by Yoshi), the colors of their armor would denote their specialization, with green being basic infantry, blue being aerial assault, yellow as the subterranean initiative, and red serving as the ballistic branch. As a war profiteer, Bowser takes an active interest in destabilization and restructuring of regions in his interest. Additionally, he also spearheads shell corporations and front ventures that clean up after the destruction, keeping his crooked contractors in business.\n\nDonkey Kong would be known as \"The Don\", a burly, hirsute fossil fuel and alloy magnate always seen wearing a tailored suit, and constantly eating bananas. The Don and Bowser would bet on and participate in weekly races against one another. Bowser is on a constant quest to try to completely consolidate his power by way of a hostile corporate takeover of the Don's industries, but also realizes that the two will maintain a strenuous symbiotic rivalry for quite some time. In spite of his industrialist leanings, the Don takes a specific interest in the preservation and conservation of the jungles and rainforests of nations known to export bananas, often putting him at odds with Bowser due to the latter's constant attempts at invasion.\n\n\"Princess\" Peach is the only daughter of a masonry engineer colloquially known as \"The Mushroom King\" due to his landmark invention of a fungal adhesive that would secure bricks and cinder blocks together better than any cement or brick mortar could. Due to her father's hyper reclusive nature, Peach runs the day to day operations of Toadstool Enterprises, often acting as a brand ambassador and the mascot of the company. The real disaster emerges during the cataclysm that begins to merge the two worlds together, the ambient radiation triggering the evolution of the fungal adhesive into sentient, ambulant life forms called \"goombas\".\n\nToad would probably remain largely unchanged, but he would be especially adept at gardening, and whenever not in the presence of Peach would only inform whoever sought her out that she was somewhere else.", "created_utc": 1495939678.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "di4ulvt", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6dob5f", "parent_id": "t1_di4cdv3", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6dob5f/hollywood_is_running_out_of_hit_80s_movies_to/di4ulvt/", "score": 14, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Intanjible", "author_id": "6hth0", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "That's exactly what they did with Ocean's Eleven, and it turned out great.

And she's hired by Ruth (played non-comically by Amy Schumer) to retrieve some Tanzanite from the hotel's safe. Did I neglect to mention that Sam is a safecracker and not a detective? Oh, and Chris Pratt isn't the elevators, to confining, he's a star, we're not paying him $3,000,000 to be the voice in an elevator, we'll get Drew Barrymore to voice the elevator. Pratt is her phone's audio assistant 'Miles', uh we explain that by saying it's a Windows phone, not enough of the movie going public will have a Windows phone to call us out on social media that the assistant is Cortana and not Miles, and even if they do have a Windows phone they probably don't know how to activate the app to ask for anything, let alone know how to tweet. Anyway, we have to work in a scene, maybe early on, maybe a car accident, where the phone gets fumbled, dropped and breaks, no no, she's on the sidewalk and a rival gang does a drive-by and shoots the phone and we can hear Miles repeat her last request two or three times and then he says,\"Let me see what Bing says about that\" and then the phone sparks and shorts out. \nAnd then she gets into the hotel, has to face a ghost maybe in the hotel to get the Tanzanite out of the safe. No not a ghost, it's a model of uncrackable safe that we'll have to go back and introduce in the first act. Oh and Miles will have mentioned that he can unlock any safe. Just double tap to unlock him.  Except he's dead dammit. So she's got to resort to watching YouTube on a laptop(?) to unlock the safe. She grabs the Tanzanite and delivers it to Ruth whereupon she is informed that the rocks are etched with super spy secrets and North Korea is defeated. maybe we need to make up a country, is North Korea too hot right now? They did that wolverines movie about NK... don't want to say anyplace in the Middle East\u2026 we're gonna have to make up a country, Malta.

The new Dirty Dancing movie is like a mediocre Disney Channel movie, but when you compare it to the original, it's really bad. \n\n>Side note: the main actress said in an interview she has absolutely no dance experience and is very clumsy. Strange choice for a dance film, no?\n\nIt's VERY strange considering the word \"dancing\" is right there in the title. Jennifer Grey is an alumna of the Dalton School, a private school where she learned dance and acting. She was also on Dancing with the Stars and won; she can actually dance. Also, her father was Joel Grey, who was in the movie, *Cabaret*, with Liza Minelli.\n\n>\"For choreographer, Bergstein chose Kenny Ortega, who had been trained by Gene Kelly.\"\n\nand\n\n>\"Director Ardolino was adamant that they choose dancers who could also act, as he did not want to use the \"stand-in\" method that had been used with Flashdance\"\n\nThe big problem was right from the start that they wanted to capitalize on the fans of the original and keep the name and use the same kinds of themes, but NOT to be a reboot or retelling; Dirty Dancing (2017) exists in the same universe as Dirty Dancing (1987).
