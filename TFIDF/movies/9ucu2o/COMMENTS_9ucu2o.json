But to a wide-eyed kid, they convey a sense of tremendous scale and awe, particularly on the big screen. \n\nAll through his career that nostalgia for Godzilla stayed with him. He decided to make Pacific Rim so he could awe the next generation of kids. Old Godzilla movies might not thrill them so he wanted to thrill them. And he did. \n\nIn the interview he mentioned how his shitty his local matinee theater was. Crumbling bricks, rats in the corner, etc. My local matinee wasn't that bad but it was the \"old\" theater in town. Parents would drop their kids off and we'd all pile in on a Saturday afternoon. It was $0.25 a ticket! They'd screen something like \"Destroy All Monsters!\" and we'd go nuts, cheering and laughing as the movie wore on, throwing popcorn around, etc. I have no idea why the theater manager put up with this shit year after year. It may have been profitable, I don't know. But we were some rambunctious little shits. \n\nNonetheless, watching \"monster movies\" on the big screen is something that stuck with me my whole life. I understand why he made Pacific Rim.

Is it really that hard to believe that he had that idea in his mind when he created the pale man character?
