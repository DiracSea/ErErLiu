Tippi fractured her leg when she was bucked off an elephant, was bitten in the neck by a lion, and had scalp injuries, but over 70 members of the cast and crew were injured during the 11 year production of the film. They couldn\u2019t keep people on. The list of injuries on Wikipedia is crazy.\n\n> Over 70 of the cast and crew are believed to have been injured during the production of Roar. Because of this, many of the attacks from the animals resulted in real blood from the actors showing up in the final cut of the film. It has been described as \"the most dangerous film ever made\". \n\n> Cinematographer Jan de Bont had his head scalped by a lion while filming under a tarp. The scalping resulted in him receiving 220 stitches. Tippi Hedren received a fractured leg after an elephant bucked her off its back while she was riding it, and also received scalp wounds. She was also bitten in the neck by a lion and required 38 stitches. Melanie Griffith had to receive 50 stitches to her face, and it was feared she would lose an eye. She recovered and was not disfigured. Noel Marshall was attacked so many times that he was eventually diagnosed with gangrene. In one of those incidents, he was clawed by a cheetah when protecting the animals during a bushfire that occurred in 1979. All animals were evacuated though it took several years for him to recover from his injuries.\n\n> Due to the injuries, turnover was high as many did not want to return to the set. Some of the lions also suffered from illnesses that reduced their population. John Marshall was bitten by one of the lions and required 56 stitches. In a 2015 interview, he commented on the film's notorious tagline that 70 people were injured during the making of the film, saying:\n\n> *\u201cTippi [Hedren] disputes the number. I believe that number is inaccurate \u2013 I believe it's over 100. It's somewhere between 70 and 100. It is the most dangerous film ever made in history. Nowadays, there's so much regulation, if you're working on a film and two people get injured, they come in and they shut you down. They have safety meetings and they say, 'What are we gonna do to change this situation?' If they did that to us after two bites, we would have said, 'I don't know what else we can do differently. Should we do it with dogs? I don't know!' If we wanna make a movie with lions, people are gonna get bitten. We just hope that nobody dies and we'll do everything we can to makes sure that doesn't happen.\u201d*\n\n> Marshall's brother Jerry was bitten in the foot while wearing tennis shoes on set. He later jokingly said the lion had a \"tennis shoe fetish.\" Assistant Director Doron Kauper had his throat bitten open, his jaw was bitten, and one of the lions attempted to rip an ear off. He was also injured in the head, chest, and thigh. Although it has been reported that the attack nearly proved fatal, a July 9, 1978 edition of the Santa Cruz Sentinel printed a quote from a nurse describing his injuries as acute, meaning simply that they were sudden and traumatic.

Because of this, many of the attacks from the animals resulted in real blood from the actors showing up in the final cut of the film. It has been described as \"the most dangerous film ever made\".[3] \n \n>Cinematographer Jan de Bont had his head scalped by a lion while filming under a tarp.[13] The scalping resulted in him receiving 220 stitches.[14] Tippi Hedren received a fractured leg after an elephant bucked her off its back while she was riding it, and also received scalp wounds. She was also bitten in the neck by a lion and required 38 stitches. Melanie Griffith had to receive 50 stitches to her face, and it was feared she would lose an eye. She recovered and was not disfigured.[7][15] Noel Marshall was attacked so many times that he was eventually diagnosed with gangrene. In one of those incidents, he was clawed by a cheetah when protecting the animals during a bushfire that occurred in 1979. All animals were evacuated though it took several years for him to recover from his injuries.[16] Due to the injuries, turnover was high as many did not want to return to the set.

He always wanted a glass of wine or champagne, with me alone, at the end of the day. He was really isolating me from everyone\". Hedren's co-star in Marnie, Diane Baker, later recalled, \"She was never allowed to gather around with the rest of us, and he demanded that every conversation between her and Hitch be held in private... Nothing could have been more horrible for me than to arrive on that movie set and to see her being treated the way she was\".\n> \n> Hitchcock revealed to Hedren one day he had a recurring dream where she came up to him and said, \"Hitch, I love you\u2014I'll always love you\". When she heard this, Hedren replied \"But it was a dream. Just a dream\", and excused herself from his presence. She believed Hitchcock had no consideration for her feelings and remembered she was humiliated after he asked her to touch him, just before shooting a scene. \"He made sure no one else could hear, and his tone and glance made it clear exactly what he meant\". Hedren asked Hitchcock's permission one day to travel to New York to appear on The Tonight Show where she was supposed to be presented an award as the Most Promising New Star. Hitchcock refused, according to his biographer, because he claimed the break would affect her performance. It was during that meeting that he apparently \"made an overt sexual proposition\" that Hedren \"could neither ignore nor answer casually, as she could his previous gestures\". In Spoto's third book about Hitchcock, Spellbound by Beauty (2008), Hedren revealed that Hitchcock actually made offensive demands on her. \"He stared at me and simply said, as if it was the most natural thing in the world, that from this time on, he expected me to make myself sexually available and accessible to him\u2014however and whenever and wherever he wanted\".\n> \n> Hedren then told him Marnie would be their last film together and later recalled how Hitchcock told her he would destroy her career. \"I said I wanted to get out of my contract. He said: 'You can't. You have your daughter to support, and your parents are getting older'. I said: 'Nobody would want me to be in this situation, I want to get out'. And he said: 'I'll ruin your career'. I said: 'Do what you have to do'. And he did ruin my career. He kept me under contract, paid me to do nothing for close on two years\". \n\nPretty creepy.", "created_utc": 1566749089.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "ey2v7r7", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_cv9dzv", "parent_id": "t1_ey2omk5", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/cv9dzv/alfred_hitchcock_used_real_birds_while_filming/ey2v7r7/", "score": 543, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "BunyipPouch", "author_id": "a1s4w", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Didn\u2019t he send her daughter (Melanie Griffith) a doll in a coffin?
