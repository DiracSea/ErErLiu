On a lot of levels, I really enjoyed the film, but the depiction of Japanese peoples and culture often felt superficial at best. \n\nMost of the dialog spoken by humans in the film is in unsubtitled Japanese. There's an understanding that most audiences won't be able to quickly understand, so when the writers want to convey something quickly, they just have the character say the word, but with \"-o\" at the end (Such as Atari saying \"biscuito\" when giving biscuits to the dogs). If it was once or twice, it would be suspect, but this crutch is leaned on constantly to get around language differences, and makes the use of Japanese throughout the rest of the film feel like a stylistic choice, rather than anything really respectful of the language itself.\n\nThere's exactly two English speaking characters in the film, one of whom is a translator through whom a lot of exposition is conveyed, the other of whom is an international exchange student who [ends up pretty much saving the day, managing to overturn generations of political corruption in one night](#spoiler) . My issue with this is that there's no reason for her to not be Japanese herself. Being an outsider never really factors into her arc, nor does it define her character. It feels like some studio exec decided that western audiences wouldn't be able to root for someone who didn't speak their language and look like them because, honestly, there's just nothing in her character that would require her to be a westerner. It just feels like pandering White-Savior Complex.\n\nAll that being said, I greatly enjoyed the film. It felt like Wes Anderson tried to make a non-pandering children movie, and for the most part I think he really succeeded. I'd be interested in the opinions and thoughts of the Japanese actors within the film on its portrayal of their culture, because I could honestly be totally off. Overall, I don't think the missteps are enough to sink the film, but I would go in wary of it's problems. \n\nEdit: A few people have pointed out to me that the addition of \"-o\" at the end of a word can be common for loan words in Japanese.

At least in Anderson\u2019s intent. \n\n(I posted another very similar comment elsewhere in the thread.)\n\nIf I had to guess Anderson initially wanted to frame the narrative from the position of the dogs which is why he has them speak English. We are are able to understand the dogs. In the dogs interaction with the human world they do not under stand Human language (in this case Japanese). they may understand a few key words, but its mostly gesture, inflection, and context clues. Hence why no subtitles for the Japanese speakers. he didn't want every word of theirs to be understood. its kind of like this farside comic strip:\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/sluggerotoole/153603564\n\n\nBut in certain cases they need to flesh out the key plot points and motivations. For the mayor character it is done during all his sessions at the podium on stage In front of TV cameras and microphones so the introduction of the female translator is not out of place. Her appearance in the context makes sense. Through her translation into English, the more detailed and nuanced points are fleshed out. \n\n\nThat then brings us to the group of student protagonists who are opposed to the mayors plan. Anderson I believe REALLY did not want to use subtitles but needed an outlet to flesh out the plot points of that side of the narrative, but the other options of human translator or machine translator wouldn't really fit or might make that part of the plot clunky or distracting. Thus we get the white foreign exchange student character who pretty much for the most part is an expository device, but the writers really didn\u2019t want her to be just Just an expository device. so her character and actions in the  plot has to be built up to give her some dimension.\n\n\nSo she, or a character like her, was needed at least if they really wanted to stick with no subtitles. (Which I think would have been an absolute no go for Anderson.)\n\nEdit:  plus the true protagonist is Atari \u201cThe Little Pilot\u201d. \n\nI really enjoyed the movie.

He could have made the movie with practically the same script, set it in Nashville, filled it with cornball references to hillbillies and country music, and it would be the same movie.\n\nUsing a mushroom cloud to mark an explosion?\n\nThe Young Pilot's name is 'Atari'?\n\nHe's just using the Japanese as a foil to be *weird* and I will not be surprised a bit if it offends.", "created_utc": 1523486435.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dx7m4fq", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8biabf", "parent_id": "t1_dx7d4ru", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8biabf/new_international_poster_for_wes_andersons_isle/dx7m4fq/", "score": 8, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "KirkUnit", "author_id": "5te54", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "[deleted]", "created_utc": 1523478547.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1523478806.0, "id": "dx7dayc", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8biabf", "parent_id": "t1_dx7c1l9", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8biabf/new_international_poster_for_wes_andersons_isle/dx7dayc/", "score": 21, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "> so when the writers want to convey something quickly, they just have the character say the word, but with \"-o\" at the end (Such as Atari saying \"biscuito\" when giving biscuits to the dogs). \n\nFyi that is Japanese for biscuit\n\n", "created_utc": 1523478988.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dx7dt1k", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8biabf", "parent_id": "t1_dx7c1l9", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8biabf/new_international_poster_for_wes_andersons_isle/dx7dt1k/", "score": 15, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "big_swinging_dicks", "author_id": "8j8ke", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Its really more so they didn't have to subtitle everyone ", "created_utc": 1523479514.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dx7ehrg", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8biabf", "parent_id": "t1_dx7c1l9", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8biabf/new_international_poster_for_wes_andersons_isle/dx7ehrg/", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Monkeymonkey27", "author_id": "14c21h", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "> It feels like some studio exec decided that western audiences wouldn't be able to root for someone who didn't speak their language and look like them because, honestly, there's just nothing in her character that would require her to be a westerner.

Being an outsider never really factors into her arc, nor does it define her character.\n\nWes Anderson movies are heavily character driven. Tons of his characters have pointless little quirks which, while adding nothing to the narrative of the film, greatly add to the depth and humanity of the character. They're pointless and goofy and lovable.\n\nWhy was Alistair Hennessey from The Life Aquatic \"part gay?\" Why was Scout Master Ward from Moonrise Kingdom a math teacher while not at camp? Why did Kylie from Fantastic Mr. Fox have excellent credit? Why did Brendan from the Darjeeling Limited have alopecia? Why was Tracy from Isle of Dogs from Cincinnati? Why did Chas from The Royal Tenenbaums breed dalmation mice, of all things?\n\nThey're all pretty mundane details about the characters that are largely insignificant to the plot, shoehorned in for no compelling reason. But frankly little details like that are exactly why I love Wes Anderson's work so much. Taking time out of the movie to slow down and appreciate little human quirks about characters is very refreshing and entertaining.\n\nAnd frankly, she had to speak English anyway. If she spoke Japanese, she would need to be translated. Who would be translating her? The only time anyone gets translated is if there's someone in-world doing the translating (other than text being translated, and very occasionally by narration). She's carrying a huge chunk of the plot on her shoulders, and she needs to be understood, and there's no in-universe reason for her to be translated. She could have subtitles, but then she'd be the only person with subtitles, and that would be remarkably stupid. She could be Japanese and speak English, but that's also very stupid and I'm sure you'd still complain about it. Or Anderson could have just given *everyone* subtitles, but that massively detracts from the creativity of the world that was established, and frankly would have made it way less enjoyable.

And with that said, it blew me away.\n\nI only thought it was some kids movie about dogs (went with my daughter). Wow was I in for a shock. I loved everything about it. I loved the humour aspect of the dogs being so straight and deadpan about everything dramatic happening around them. Such nuance and detail in the characters that could be missed if you're used to the standard Hollywood blockbuster style. I loved that it gave moments to absorb what was happening with held shots whilst the dramatic music of the drums continued relentlessly in the background. Those pauses really intrigued me.\n\nIn a sense I guess you could almost compare it to South Park. There's something about the characters who were very deliberately forced to turn and face the camera. Even when they turn sideways it would only be briefly and then have them face back at the audience whilst forcing us to pause along with them and absorb a moment whilst staring them in the face.\n\nBut all that amongst the action that goes on around them. It's almost James Bond like. These dogs acting so deadpan matter-of-fact whilst the world around them is going through an existential crisis and their own predicament would send others in to insanity.\n\nMaybe that makes some people uncomfortable. Maybe some people get awkward when a movie doesn't keep an incessant march of progress through the plot. But I loved it. The way to forced us to share at these dogs and take things in at their pace.\n\nAnd the humour was beautiful. I totally imagine it would irritate some people. It was quirky humour. Silly humour and often quite subtle, staggering a line of whether it was humour at all. But it always was, yet to some eyes I could imagine people saying, \"What mate. I don't get it? Is this meant to be funny or somefink?\"\n\nAnd the detail throughout the movie was intense. The music was well placed, even if just incessant drumming. The style was beautiful and intricately done. The characters intriguing.\n\nAnd scenes like the kidney transplant. Totally not needed but just a nice little touch of silliness. That sums up the whole movie. A visual feast of silliness  around a very serious story that reflects the very dangerous and real scenario we all find ourselves in the real world.\n\nI can't really in words do justice to how much I enjoyed this movie.

In her introduction scene, we're shown this whole classroom, all these kids who are politically motivated to help the dogs, but outside the hacker, who is never formally named or given any lines, she, the only non-asian kid in the room, saves the day. I have no issue with her, or her whiteness, or her helping and trying to do good. My problem comes from that out of all of these kids who really want to help the dogs, she is the only one from that classroom that's focused on.\n\nAdditionally, if her motivation or character had to do with her whiteness, her otherness from those around her, I wouldn't have much of a problem with it. She is clearly an outsider trying to do good, but other than being handed a deportation notice that's immediately revoked, her outsider status doesn't effect her journey at all. There's no *plot* reason for her to be an outsider, yet she clearly is one. At least for me, that kind of tonal inconsistency takes away from the movie.\n\nI do totally agree with you that she was added so that western audiences would have an English speaking character, I just disagree with that approach stylistically. Of course, this is entirely my own tastes, but I think, if the dogs and the dogs only spoke english, and the rest of the cast spoke Japanese, there would be been a better distinction between their worlds. It may have required more effort put into blocking or scenery in order to convey story to an audience that most likely doesn't speak the language, but I feel that would be worth it for what it would acheive. The film's only in limited release anyways (I live in a major US city, and I could only find one theater showing it), so I don't see why they would tailor the film to a wide market.

The more interesting thing for me was that because of how the language works, a lot of people aren't actually going to understand you if you say those loan words \"correctly\" as they'd be pronounced in their original language - if you don't know the loanword itself as it's said in Japanese, you're better off saying it with a fake \"stereotypical Japanese accent\" than saying it how you're regularly say it. \n\nThe language has a kind of limited syllabary that's based mostly on pure vowel / consonant pairs - pretty much the pure vowels themselves (a e u i o = \u3042\u3000\u3048 \u3046 \u3044 \u304a) and combinations (e.g. ka ke ku ki ko = \u304b\u3000\u3051 \u304f \u304d \u3053) with a few switches and sounds that just don't exist e.g. there is no crisp \"ti\" sound (pronounced \"tee\"), only \"chi\" = \u3061. \n\nWhen people that have grown up with that limited syllabary first used words incorporating the *much* more complex sounds that exist in germanic/romantic/etc languages, the words ended up being \"modified\" into very common words today, many of which don't sound like their native language original. For example, a few (also, I was writing hiragana above, but all loanwords are written in katakana - they're both the simplest character set and represent the exact same sounds, just appear differently for different purposes):\n\n- \u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb - \"aidoru\" meaning \"idol\"\u3000\n- \u30a2\u30a4\u30b9 - \"aisu\" meaning \"ice\" as in \"ice cream\"\n- \u30c1\u30b1\u30c3\u30c8 - \"chiketto\" meaning \"ticket\" \n- \u30b3\u30fc\u30d2\u30fc - \"k\u014dh\u012b\" meaning \"coffee\"\n- \u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30c8 - \"faito\" meaning \"fight\" but also a really common chant/cheer for sports teams, like \"Do your best\" or similar\n- \u30d3\u30fc\u30eb - \"b\u012bru\" meaning \"beer\"\n\nHonestly it's kind of tough to get used to a lot of those words until you develop your overall vocabulary a bit more, because they're pronounced like regular Japanese most of the time and don't stick out in the middle of a spoken sentence if you only know a little or none. \n\nAnyways, just a little extra knowledge for you if you made it all the way through!\n\n\n ", "created_utc": 1523488677.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dx7ocu4", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8biabf", "parent_id": "t1_dx7dlxr", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8biabf/new_international_poster_for_wes_andersons_isle/dx7ocu4/", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "blay12", "author_id": "6g0io", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "> I do totally agree with you that she was added so that western audiences would have an English speaking character, I just disagree with that approach stylistically.\n\nBut does a stylistic choice = cultural appropriation?

We are are able to understand the dogs.  In the dogs interaction with the human world they do not under stand English for the most part.  they may understand a few key words, but its mostly gesture and context clues.  Hence why no subtitles for the Japanese speakers. he didn't want every word of theirs to be understood.  its kind of like this farside comic strip:  \n\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/sluggerotoole/153603564\n\nBut in certain cases they need to flesh out the key plot points and motivations.  For the mayor character it is done during all his sessions at the podium on stage In front of TV cameras and microphones so the introduction of the female translator is not out of place.  Her appearance in the context makes sense.  But through her translation the more detailed and nuanced points are fleshed out for the mayor.  \n\nThat then brings us to the group of student protagonists who are opposed to the mayors plan.  Anderson I believe REALLY did not want to use subtitles but needed an outlet to flesh out the plot points of that side of the narrative, but the other options of human translator or machine translator wouldn't really fit or might make that part of the plot clunky or distracting.  Thus we get the foreign exchange student character who pretty much for the most part is an expository device, but the writing couldn't just have the character be just that so her character and plot point has to be built up to give her some dimension.  \n\nSo she, or a character like her, was needed at least if they really wanted to stick with no subtitles. \n\nI really enjoyed the movie.  This might be my favorite Anderson movie yet.  Its definitely in the top 3.  \n\n\nedit:  expository instead of expeditionary.  \n", "created_utc": 1523485111.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1523486966.0, "id": "dx7kspg", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8biabf", "parent_id": "t1_dx7fqko", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8biabf/new_international_poster_for_wes_andersons_isle/dx7kspg/", "score": 10, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "TTUShooter", "author_id": "g0jq8", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Wow, really?
