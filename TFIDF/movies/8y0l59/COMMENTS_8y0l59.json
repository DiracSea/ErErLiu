Rather than try to change the character to fit the world they created (X-Men, looking at you), they build a world where the audience is convinced the character can exist.\n\nCaptain America is a great example. *Look at his stupid costume,* they said; *no way that it can work on screen*. Yet Marvel builds a world around the character where his costume not only fits with the story, but enriches the story. Steve Rodgers actually states what everyone is thinking, that his suit is old-fashioned and, citing the implication, really silly looking in modern times. Coulson is right there with the slam dunk quote, that given what is happening in the world, everyone could use a little old-fashioned. Just like that, his silly costume becomes a symbol of what he stands for. The audience no longer thinks it looks silly. With one Phil Coulson quote, they're now proud to see him wearing it.\n\nAll the X-Men movies needed to do was to endear the audience to the colorful suits in the same way. Here is a quick example of how easy that could have been:\n\n**Scene: Danger Room Interior**\n\nMost of the X-Men have gathered to discuss [insert dramatic situation the team needs to deal with]. They all have their black leather tactical gimp-suits on and everyone in the room looks ready for war. Wolverine steps to the front of the group, lighting a cigar.\n\n**Wolverine:** *I'm not Chuck.*\n\nHe stops in front of Cyclops, who curls his lip in disapproval.\n\n**Wolverine:** *Yeah, I know, kid. But if the Professor were here, he'd want to remind you all that this rescue is just as much about the humans we're attacking as it is about the mutants we're going in there to save. For every human aiming a rifle at your head, there's a thousand more of them watching on YouTube waiting to see what you plan to do about it-*\n\nPOP! Wolverine is interrupted by a loud snap at the back of the room. All heads turn toward the back, where the young mutant Jubilee is loudly chewing bubble gum. Standing out against the sea of black leather, she is wearing a bright yellow trenchcoat, a pink graphic tee, and Chuck Taylors. Her glare is narrowed at Wolverine. Tension is palpable.\n\n**Jubilee:** *I want to make sure I have this straight, Logan. I'm supposed to be afraid? Afraid to lose control of my powers while fighting against the government-sanctioned genocide of my species? Afraid to do everything in my power to free other mutants from imprisonment and slavery? Afraid because a handful of BLOGGERS might accuse us of forming an army against humankind?\"*\n\nAnother loud snap of gum. Wolverine shifts his gaze to Cyclops, who seems to find this amusing.\n\n**Jubilee:** *Newsflash! We ARE an army! And even if you wanted us to pretend like we aren't, you have us dressed from head to toe in tactical black leather like a bunch of Nazi stormtroopers. I say if we're going out there to prove that we're different than the humans we're trying to stop, we should LOOK different. The people you're talking about are always going to see us as freaks and weirdos anyway, it's not like yellow spandex is going to push them over the edge.*\n\nWolverine arches a brow.\n\n**Wolverine:** *Yellow spandex?*\n\nHe sighs in defeat. Jubilee snaps another bubble and grins.\n\n**Wolverine:** *Get on the plane.*\n\nJubilee skips past Wolverine, toward the Blackbird. The other X-Men follow behind her, talking excitedly about their costume ideas. Only Scott Summers stays behind, smiling wide at Wolverine.\n\n**Cyclops:** *You know, I think she's right. If we keep doing this thing dressed like a black-ops military unit, people are going to be afraid. I don't know if yellow spandex is the answer-*\n\n**Wolverine:** *It isn't.*\n\nWolverine grunts and heads toward the jet, flicking his cigar at Cyclops' feet. Scott frowns, but turns his gaze toward a blue and yellow flight suit hanging next to a rack of parachutes. He tilts his head, considering some costume ideas of his own.\n\n**End scene.**\n\nHasty fanfiction aside, a scene like this works functionally the same way as the short dialogue between Cap and Coulson. You have a character (Wolverine) arguing what the audience initially thinks, that bright costumes are stupid, and a second character (Jubilee) making an endearing argument for why the bright costumes are necessary. Through the context of the scene, if I did my job right, the viewer should be inclined to agree with Jubilee and now the costumes become a part of what make the characters special. At this point, because of the great work done by Marvel Studios, superhero costumes are a big part of audience excitement and nobody thinks twice about bright colors or weird helmets.\n\nWish they would have taken a moment in the early films to create a scene like this, so that the X-Men wouldn't be limited to tactical Underarmor because of audience perception.", "created_utc": 1531346705.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e27x40a", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8y0l59", "parent_id": "t1_e27gpny", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8y0l59/first_image_of_jack_dylan_grazer_zachary_levi_as/e27x40a/", "score": 13, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "DefNotAShark", "author_id": "i1myo7e", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "To be fair, the whole point of First Class was to show these characters as young people just learning how to use their powers and what their place was in the world.
