To highlight how silly some of her stuff is, look no further than these ridiculous anti-bullying emojis that she helped to create in a partnership with Vodaphone.\n\n[https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/02/monica-lewinsky-emoji-safer-internet](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/02/monica-lewinsky-emoji-safer-internet)\n\nAgain, I'm not trying to diminish her as a person or what she went through, but the way in which she depoliticizes the nature of bullying whether it's harassment based on gender, race, disability, or sexual orientation just sort of removes any power behind the whole project imo. It's one thing to be \"against bullying\" but it takes additional courage to call out the power structures that make bullying permissive in our culture.\n\nAgain, I almost feel like a jerk to bring any of this up, because I'm certain she went through hell and that she probably has noble intentions. However, the whole thing strikes me as the type of vanity project that ultimately won't fix much of anything, other than her image in the public eye.", "created_utc": 1571682010.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "f4msnkw", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_dl3h1y", "parent_id": "t3_dl3h1y", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/dl3h1y/monica_lewinsky_to_produce_hbo_documentary_15/f4msnkw/", "score": 27, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "FoolishFellow", "author_id": "ax68n", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Let\u2019s be honest though.

Brown was unable to force Robyn F. out of the vehicle because she was wearing a seat belt. When he could not force her to exit, he took his right hand and shoved her head against he passenger window of the vehicle, causing an approximate one-inch raised circular contusion.\n\nRobyn F. turned to face Brown and he punched her in the left eye with his right hand.
