Perhaps their cells will slowly deteriorate but he's convinced he can save them if he just keeps working at it, while an ethics committee demands they are humanely euthanised and he fights to keep trying to keep them alive.  You'd leverage the audience's expectations at this point because they would assume the committee are the bad guys and Keanu is the renegade genius who will save his family's life at all cost.\n\nSo he goes full-fugitive, trying to do his work in a dirty underground lab, and the ethics committee has to decide whether to go to press and risk him being publically destroyed in the media, which they don't want that because Keanu is their friend and they know his reckless actions are borne out of pain (hey look it's an ethical decision by an ethics committee!) Or whether they try to keep it quiet to protect his reputation while seeking him out to ensure his wife and child can die peacefully instead of their inevitable, painful demise. \n\nBut as time runs out, the vote on the Committee slowly shifts until it is decided to go to the press. The press brands him evil, his career is ruined, and there's a witch-hunt, while Keanu continues to reassure his family - now in pain - that he can save them (believing against all hope that he can), until his wife begs him to let her and the child go and he reluctantly has to face their loss once and for all.\n\nAnd then they all die.\n\nEnd on him in handcuffs and media people discussing why the ethics committee took so long to report the disappearance and casting moral judgements on who is bad/good, with \"experts\" labelling people sociopaths or narcissists of whatever, thereby highlighting the simplistic moralising and public shaming culture of the digital age.\n\nI'd watch *that*.

But not smart. Here's why:\n\n\nEver hear of the Monkey and Ladder experiment? It basically goes like this:\n\n\n> A group of scientists placed 5 monkeys in a cage and in the middle, a ladder with bananas on the top. Every time a monkey went up the ladder, the scientists soaked the rest of the monkeys with cold water. After a while, every time a monkey went up the ladder, the others beat him to stop the water. After some time, no monkey dared to go up the ladder regardless of the temptation. Scientists then decided to substitute one of the monkeys. The 1st thing this new monkey did was to go up the ladder. Immediately the other monkeys beat him up. After several beatings, the new member learned not to climb the ladder even though he never knew why. A 2nd monkey was substituted and the same occurred. The 1st replaced monkey even participated in the beating of the 2nd monkey. A 3rd monkey was changed and the same was repeated. Eventually all the monkeys were replaced and they all knew to beat each other when they got on the ladder. What was left was a group of 5 monkeys that even though they never received a cold shower, they continued to beat up any monkey who attempted to climb the ladder.\n\n\nFor the last decade, these \"smart\" businessmen (monkeys) have done nothing but beat each other by making the same formulaic bullshit that audiences have seen hundreds of times. Sure the formula may have been based on that one monkey who got a banana that one time, but all the monkeys have been replaced and no one remembers what worked originally so they treat that formula like a fucking bible. \n\n\nThe basic formula of \"make a movie based off of what the audience is liking\" only really works if there's a steady stream of new ideas that this formula can ride coattails on. For the better part of the last decade, however, studios have all but stopped making original ideas. This is because these ideas are a more riskier investment, but they are what sustains the film industry over time since it provides the audience with something new that other studios can mimic and profit off of. If these risky new ideas are passed up for a \"safer\" bet of formulaic cinematic copypasta, then given enough time we get to where we are now. Which is an unprecedented year of studio bombs that were all made using that \"safe\" but dried out formula.\n\n\nTe only underdog success was fucking Deadpool, and ALL the fucking \"smart\" businessmen had pegged that as a failure before it's release. They even tried to throw wrenches into it since it was so far removed from their precious formula. Fox studios gave them only half the budget they requested after about 10 years of development, virtually no marketing, and a release date in February for an action movie. All because it didn't fit the \"formula\" since it had an R rating and comedy in a super hero movie. Despite all that, the movie absolutely killed it in the box office. \n\n\nSounds pretty close to that monkey experiment doesn't it?\n\n\nThe problem is that making movies soley based off of what audiences like is impossible since audiences don't know what they like until they see it, and even worse, tend to grow bored of what they do like. That's why historically there's been long runs of certain genres of movies like musicals in the 40's, westerns in the 50's, and machismo action in the 80's and 90's. These fads always die out  because audiences simply get bored of watching the same fucking movie all over again. We're now easily past the decade mark of the super hero genre flick, but we keep making every movie, even non super hero movies, in the same formula. And that's not even mentioning the long turn around time in movie production (1-2 years) that makes it even harder to replicate what an audience \"currently\" likes. \n\n\nTaking all this into consideration, I hope you can see that at this point of declining box office revenues, 10 years of the same formula being applied to every movie, and audiences themselves even saying the shit they see is formulaic, that a \"smart\" businessman is not one who would play it \"safe\" and make another movie based off their bullshit formula. Instead, a \"smart\" business man is one who would realize that at this point in time, the holy formula for movie making is JUST as risky as making something original. A smart business man would fight the other monkeys, and climb that ladder to find a banana at the top.\n", "created_utc": 1473271876.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d7d3dny", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_51lqqv", "parent_id": "t1_d7cw18i", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/51lqqv/new_keanu_reeves_movie_replicas_about_a_brilliant/d7d3dny/", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Rmans", "author_id": "3v70f", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Oh so it's the audience who are morons?
