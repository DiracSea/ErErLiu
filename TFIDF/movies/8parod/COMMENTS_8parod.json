The Lego Movie was far below that. They were called out for the obvious contradiction but chose not to comment and address it.\n\nAnd then the year The Lego Batman Movie should have been among the nominated, they were passed over for Boss Baby. It's agreed by all but a very few (among both professionals in the film industry and us viewers) that it was definitely a snub.\n\nThe most likely reason for these snubs is that the Academy in general dislikes meta pop culture, superhero, and anime films. Counter argument to this is that Wreck It Ralph has been nominated in the past, as were Big Hero 6 and The Tale of Princess Kaguya and The Wind Rises and Spirited Away before that. On the other hand, all five of those examples were either Disney or Miyazaki produced - both have a very favorable nostalgia and history with the Academy. If the issue is general bias, it's a matter of an Academy and voting process that has not aged well and kept pace with modern genre changes and what constitutes good story telling.\n\nThe more conspiratorial theories argue they have something against Lord and Miller specifically, or that even *Disney* is complicit in bribing or pressuring nomination decisions. These don't hold much water though - Lord and Miller wouldn't be the first professionals to be passed over and over despite stellar delivery, and the latter would be an outright scandal that could severely damage the Disney brand (I seriously doubt anyone in the company would take such a stupid unethical risk).
