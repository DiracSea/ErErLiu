About 30-45  minutes in, just when the movie is getting into one of the first time nighttime scenes, I hear a soft voice say \"Daddy\" from the the top of the stairs (which were behind me). About pissed myself. Put the kiddo back to bed, and spend the rest of the movie looking over my shoulder to make sure he doesn't do it to me again.

Really liked the fact that the whole plot started and centered around the protagonist actually being a film student trying to get a project made. The underlying student film was soooo contrived and garbage, like so many student films are (not insulting you folk in school for film, just saying that like any profession, you gotta cut your teeth a bit in order to improve, unless you're a prodigy, in which case just go away and let the normies feel better). You're watching these shitty \"interview scenes\" with these actors that seem more like they're there doing a favor for their friend, listening to them drone on and on, only to find out that fucking Slenderman is literally a few fucking yards away the entire time with no one acknowledging it beyond the simple fact that the creator uploaded a random bit of raw footage of a fucked up take. Random long videos of the protagonist filming himself in his home in complete silence with nothing but the unspoken anxiety you could feel but not always see, just like we all do when we're inwardly freaking out but going through the motions of required every day living. The amateur actors didn't have to \"nail\" the performance perfectly as a majority of the emotional tension came from the progression and piecing it together.\n  \n  \nWhen Slenderman hit \"meme\" status, internet explanation after internet explanation simply cited the vague history of the story that's been around for a while, and just sort of said yeah, and now its popular and spooky. Most peoples first encounter with it was either that dumb kid that did whatever she did (dont remember) because Slenderman told her to (lol), or the indie game created using the same exact fear tactics as the YouTube series (including the distortion, non movement when staring at him, etc). When people were all hyped on that game and millions of Let's Plays came out for it, I never saw Marble Hornets referenced. Which felt like a shame as that simple game really boiled down the unique anxiety of the creature to a 10 minute gameplay experience. The best of the horror came from the fact that the protagonist was straight stalked and psychologically tortured by this stuff for ages.\n  \n  \nI imagine the value of the YouTube series would be lost viewing it today, much like anyone revisiting Blair Witch Project or seeing it for the first time while knowing context. But man was it cool when literally none of us had heard of the vague urban legend, and it was a friend who was so hyped and invested that made you sit and watch it.\n  \n  \nParties, group hangouts, one on ones, people were showing each other the videos allll the time. All types of people too. Pretty much everyone was \"into\" YouTube at the time as it was the more innocent era of people making content for fun instead of personal branding. Amateur story driven series were just not common, especially suspenesful/cryptic/horror stuff.\n  \n  \nIt fell off my radar a bit once I started gearing up for college. Updates become a lot more sparse, likely because those involved were graduating and such. Didn't have a YouTube account back then, so without subscriptions it was easy to forget about something.\n  \n  \nMan was it cool though. Seeing Slender blow up and having friends starting to reccomend it or ask if I played it was weird as pretty much everyone went into trying to explain what Slenderman was before describing the game. At first I thought the popularity and backstory came off of Marble Hornets blowing up without me noticing, so I'd be like \"yeah it's based off that myth and that YouTube series that got it in the limelight, right?\" Literally none of them knew what I was talking about. Thought I'd get to be a hipster getting to do a \"mmm yeah I knew all about it way before it was cool...\", but instead no one cared as I sat there trying to explain there aren't hornets made of marble in the Slenderman back story. Weee social reality. But yeah, chalked it up to some high schools not picking up the trend the same as ours did. Weird time when content popularity and \"memes\" weren't centralized (beyond looking at the \"most viewed\" category) for the entire internet and word of mouth dictated what was popular or incessantly quoted at school. Sort of in between the era of literally everyone going to ebaumsworld/albinoblacksheep and content aggregators and advertisers finding the \"worthwhile\" stuff for you. \n  \n  \nCloverfield was definitely close to Blair Witch and of course got huuuge buzz with its marketing exposure. The trailer clips building the hype were legitimately captivating and spooky. Still, by the time you sat in your seat, you knew what you were watching and settled in for a shaky Godzilla good time.\n  \n  \nMarble Hornets wasnt the most AMAZING series out there, but it really made up for its rough edges by holding back the mystery throughout its upload heyday.\n  \n  \nMannnn good times.", "created_utc": 1554821359.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1554826614.0, "id": "ekh0c0q", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_bb6gmm", "parent_id": "t1_ekgtf8m", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/bb6gmm/the_blair_witch_project_changed_horror_forever_it/ekh0c0q/", "score": 53, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "PossumJackPollock", "author_id": "11ldoobw", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Ah I miss the old days of the internet when so much wasn't known yet so people imagined such crazy things in the fog of ignorance.

Possibly same spirits that gunked Josh's gear in first film.\n\nVideo footage is revealed. \n\nTristen is accused of being the witch and she hangs herself. \n\nThis is the point where a little more extrapolation is needed. Earlier in the film Jeff says \"video never lies, but film does\".\nThe party have been sharing some kind of group hallucination, which is mostly what we've been privy to (film) the tapes (video) show the reality that they murdered the people at coffin rock, Jeff killed Erica, Kim killed the store worker,  and then they lynched Tristen. \n\nA further kink in things is that Kim is actually clairvoyant, but doesn't really realize it. She knows Tristen is pregnant iirc,  she foresees Jeff being executed for murder...and the files she finds in Jeff's desk are actually the police files from the end of the film,  which the others could only be able to see if they were somehow sharing a consciousness. \n\nI know there are holes, and definite supposition, and Christ knows which materials outside the two films are definitely canon...but this has been my read since I saw Book of Shadows at its cinema release and I'm sticking with it ;op\n\nThis was also an arse to type out on Mobile.", "created_utc": 1554839222.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "ekhsyln", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_bb6gmm", "parent_id": "t1_ekhh3nx", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/bb6gmm/the_blair_witch_project_changed_horror_forever_it/ekhsyln/", "score": 11, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "agoMiST", "author_id": "7d4s9", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "the Film Theory episode of this movie on youtube explains that Heathers Journal was marketing material the producers uploaded online to supplement the film. that is the supporting evidence of the theory.", "created_utc": 1554833829.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "ekhktm1", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_bb6gmm", "parent_id": "t1_ekhh3nx", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/bb6gmm/the_blair_witch_project_changed_horror_forever_it/ekhktm1/", "score": 8, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "danonjj", "author_id": "hrk2y", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "#BUT THAT'S *JUST* A THEORY.
