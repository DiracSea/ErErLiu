In this manner of consumption, the cigars often became mauled and frayed. To address this problem, Churchill devised what he called a \"bellybando,\" which was a strip of brownish paper with a little glue on one end. To prevent the cigar from becoming excessively moist and to keep it from fraying, he would wrap the bellybando around the end.\"\n\nThe bellybandos also made it somewhat easier for Churchill to smoke so many cigars every day, because they limited direct contact with the tobacco and, therewith, Churchill's intake of nicotine. Churchill smoked his cigars down to about the last one or two inches, and, later in life, when he spent much of his time in the country at Chartwell, his staff would save all of the ends of his cigars in order to give them to one of the gardeners at Chartwell, a Mr. Kearnes, who liked to break them up and smoke them in his pipe.\"", "created_utc": 1513228618.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dr86dxo", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7jmy5f", "parent_id": "t3_7jmy5f", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7jmy5f/gary_oldman_smoked_20000_worth_of_cigars_while/dr86dxo/", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "dieterschaumer", "author_id": "h4vik", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "He's dedicated to the craft.
