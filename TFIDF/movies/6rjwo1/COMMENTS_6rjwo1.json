My Manager, who was a true joy to work with, sent me out to pick up her lunch, as she usually did. On this fateful day she had a craving for Little Caesar's breadsticks and she gave me exact change to pay for it, so off I went. Upon arriving I paid for the food and was asked if I wanted dipping sauce at an extra charge. My Manager had given exact change so I assumed she ordered what she wanted and declined their saucy offer.  \n\nAfter getting back and delivering her food, she quickly discovered that there was no dipping sauce and began to question me about it rather aggressively, as if I had plotted against her in some form or fashion. I explained that she gave exact change and I had no money on me to cover the additional expense. At this point she began to explain to me how stupid I was and pointed out that her boyfriend was a big, tough guy who could kick my ass. I don't recall exactly what I said but I know it wasn't improper for the workplace. Regardless, she felt the appropriate retort was to grab movie cases from the shelf and begin throwing them at me. Thankfully, I was rather spry in my youth so I was able to dodge the projectile attacks with only minimal effort. Unfortunately, I was also rather shortsighted in my youth so I began throwing movie cases back at her in response to her unprovoked assault. I was asked to leave shortly thereafter, and was fired via a telephone call that evening. I learned from a former co-worker that she, too, was let go following the incident when the District Manager reviewed the surveillance tape.  \n\nIn fairness, I was a terrible employee and deserved to be fired for a host of other reasons that I won't get into here.
