I think they're shooting for that \"just realistic enough\" to fool a general audience into believing that this could actually happen. Voodoo \"magic\" isn't real or particularly scary IMHO. Killer AI's? Also not very real, but by putting it closer to \"real\" tech they make the ideas more \"real\" and therefore more scary to a general audience that isn't going to know the inane technical details of actual AI research. Everything we use everyday has \"AI\" in it. Will the movie feel more dated as a result in 20 or 30 years? Yeah, probably. That's not necessarily bad though. People still enjoy \"dated\" movies all the time.\n\nAlso, anyone whose seen Mark Hamill's stint as the voice of the Joker in the '90s Batman Animated Series, would agree that he is absolutely perfect for this role. Getting a new voice for the doll also keeps it out of uncanny valley territory for fans of the original Chucky series. This isn't *their* Chucky, so lets not confuse the matter by having him look identical and sound exactly the same (looks are similar, but distinct enough to differentiate).
