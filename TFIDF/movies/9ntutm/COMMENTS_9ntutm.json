(I was 18). I remember people panicking and saying we were a target because of the base or something nearby, which I was pretty skeptical of (middle of Iowa), but you know, people were scared.  That said, my Dad did work in the building next to the Sears tower at the time (Chicago), which had me slightly concerned, as we didn't yet know the full extent of the attack, only that iconic buildings had been targeted.  Aweful as it was, for one day people weren't shitty to each other, which was strangely refreshing. Then a day or two later it was like a switch went off, the flags came out, and people got ugly and aggressive to anyone who looked remotely middle eastern (I saw an Indian couple get attacked in the parking lot). It was a bit of a wakeup call for me as a suburban white kid just few months out of high school.  It's colored my entire adult life.  Not so much the incident itself but the aftermath.  I'm now 35 and just trying to get back to the optimism and enthusiam I put on hold at the time.
