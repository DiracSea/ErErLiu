There was a Chinese talk show that was a national sensation. Ended in like 09 (CORRECTION: Late 2003-2004, which makes the next bit even more timely). The host, Cui Yonyuan, was a huge celebrity known for his integrity, wit, and candour, by most accounts a stand up guy. \n\nIn 2003, along comes a pretty famous Chinese director Feng xiaogang, who says to Cui, I wanna make a movie about a talk show host, please let me into your life. So cui does. The result is a movie called cell phone, a pretty decent dramedy. \n\nUnfortunately the plot of the movie is not kind to the host. Not only are the characters pretty direct correlations to real people (like if you wanted to mention Tom cruise but you called your guy Tim roam, that level of not-a-disguise), but the plot of the movie involved the host sleeping with his protege, who then used it as blackmail leverage to replace him as the host of the show.\n\n In real life, Cui was indeed replaced by his protege, He Jing. The affair is obviously not confirmed but this film likely did nonzero amounts of damage to the real proteges career and the program was cancelled after a year.\n\nFan binging played the protege in the movie. A sequel to Cell Phone is coming out. So the talk show host Cui finally lost his shit.\n\nHe posts all the dirt he's got on Chinese twitter, calling out the director Feng and Fan bingbing,  including the tax evasion contract. At this point fan was supposedly in America when the story broke. For a while Chinese netizens were speculating that she was gonna seek asylum. \n\nWhich brings us to the secret arrest. I speculate that the govt offered her a deal to avoid further suspicion and international attention, but who really knows. There are also allegations that she made comments critical of the govt shortly before this arrest but China hasn't talked about it at all, since the narrative is that it all started with the talk show host.\n\nEdit: names have been added for clarification.", "created_utc": 1539795108.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1539864912.0, "id": "e7y0ooc", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_9oze1k", "parent_id": "t1_e7xwebd", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/9oze1k/bruce_willis_film_air_strike_canceled_after/e7y0ooc/", "score": 8813, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "pre_nerf_infestor", "author_id": "b5r2k", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "The timeline is super sketchy.\n\nMovie cancelled 1 hour and 2 minutes after she has been seen for the first time in 3 months.

What happened is that someone begged him to explain China to outsiders, and considered him the best for the job - and he obliged. To me what makes it great is that it's not just an accurate explanation of China and the Chinese, but rather the perspective on China and the Chinese from a bloody genius who has found a way to have a huge appreciation of it.\n\nOne thing I've got to mention about it is that it was written in 1935 - before the Communist revolution. Despite that, it holds remarkably true. It's the stuff that passes down through families that no one can knock out of them. You'll also see him expressing himself like a guy from that generation - a bunch of casual stereotyping, maybe a bit of dabbling in eugenics and such. It's not the guy, but how communication was at the time. It provides a bit of side-interest and the signal still comes through.\n\nAs a bonus, it immediately allowed me to enjoy a lot of HK movies much more (especially obvious wherever they've actually got traditional Taoist/transient, Buddhist/naive, Confucian/career-minded, dangerous ghost women, etc. archetypes). Also does a good job of explaining Chinese art composition and relationship to Chinese calligraphy and such, and accurately points out that Chinese (still do) really tend to look down on anything that doesn't involve more than what's there at face value - and makes a pretty compelling case for why that is.\n\nExtra note: A couple years later, I stumbled upon a little (translated) ancient Chinese quote/short-story in defence of chaos/disorder which struck me as one of the most wonderful things I'd ever seen. I was interested enough in it that I looked it up.. and discovered that Lin Yutang was the translator (Edit: I think I was probably wrong - I think someone else translated it).", "created_utc": 1539829340.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1539872977.0, "id": "e7z4l5d", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_9oze1k", "parent_id": "t1_e7y9z90", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/9oze1k/bruce_willis_film_air_strike_canceled_after/e7z4l5d/", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "NewFolgers", "author_id": "11t1fn", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Liberals are always going after poor Ted Cruz./s", "created_utc": 1539799379.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1539800184.0, "id": "e7y5zme", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_9oze1k", "parent_id": "t1_e7y4g0k", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/9oze1k/bruce_willis_film_air_strike_canceled_after/e7y5zme/", "score": 128, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "cenasmgame", "author_id": "582p0", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Lyin' Tom Cruz ", "created_utc": 1539801126.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e7y85up", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_9oze1k", "parent_id": "t1_e7y4g0k", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/9oze1k/bruce_willis_film_air_strike_canceled_after/e7y85up/", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "SebbyHafen", "author_id": "153w8c", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Pretty decent tunes, actually", "created_utc": 1539799965.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e7y6pbr", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_9oze1k", "parent_id": "t1_e7y55gq", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/9oze1k/bruce_willis_film_air_strike_canceled_after/e7y6pbr/", "score": 62, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Munelluboch", "author_id": "1uykp7xl", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "VHS sexxxx", "created_utc": 1539803235.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e7yaqks", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_9oze1k", "parent_id": "t1_e7y55gq", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/9oze1k/bruce_willis_film_air_strike_canceled_after/e7yaqks/", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Villager723", "author_id": "or79j", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Mmm...
