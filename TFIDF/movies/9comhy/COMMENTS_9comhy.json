This may or may not have created the condition where a nationwide turndown in housing was possible to begin with. Either way the movie completely ignored the complexities there in favor of some narrative about the agencies just not caring.

The first was someone who wrote that epilogue not understanding a broad analogy Burry used in an interview to describe agricultural plays and the second was literally a tongue in cheek quip put in a single email from a Goldman rep. Mortgage tranches never went away because the problem wasn't the tranches themselves it was the shit put in the tranches and mislabeled. Risk modeling, capital requirements, and oversight have completely changed since 2008 which is the important part. \n\nNot to say you shouldn't enjoy the movie.  Just realize that it had a narrative to push and ignores some important things in creating that narrative.
