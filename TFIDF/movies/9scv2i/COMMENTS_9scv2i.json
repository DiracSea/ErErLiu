He hunches in a little, tilts his head down, avoids eye contact. At times he even seems to stoop to be lower than them.\n\n>This isn't an odd personal mannerism- not entirely anyway.

The SpeakEasy Scene (spoiler alert, the link shows several clips from the movie but I have time-stamped it so it goes to the correct scene) shows him tilting his body way from the boss, casting his eyes downward. It's only when he starts to protect his Bowtruckle and needs to assert dominance that he starts to sit up and make direct eye contact.\n\n>Newt Scamander is used to dealing with all manner of beasties and knows exactly the affect his body language has on others. \n\n[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/5eb0b8/fantastic_beasts_new_scamanders_odd_behaviorisms/)\n\n", "created_utc": 1540833486.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e8o90zy", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_9scv2i", "parent_id": "t1_e8o6qp9", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/9scv2i/chinese_poster_for_fantastic_beasts_the_crimes_of/e8o90zy/", "score": 52, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "molagdrn", "author_id": "nm4r2", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "[deleted]", "created_utc": 1540832207.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1563988325.0, "id": "e8o7fn5", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_9scv2i", "parent_id": "t1_e8o6qp9", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/9scv2i/chinese_poster_for_fantastic_beasts_the_crimes_of/e8o7fn5/", "score": 26, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I\u2019ve seen theories that Quidditch is suffering because brooms are getting faster and faster, you hear about all these historical Quidditch games that lasted days, while the longest in the series is like 4 hours, and that was before Harry got his Firebolt.
