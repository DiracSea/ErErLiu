I told my granddad I'd just seen James Bond and asked if we could go over so I could get his autograph. My grandad had no idea who James Bond or Roger Moore were, so we walked over and he popped me in front of Roger Moore, with the words \"my grandson says you're famous. Can you sign this?\"\n\n>As charming as you'd expect, Roger asks my name and duly signs the back of my plane ticket, a fulsome note full of best wishes. I'm ecstatic, but as we head back to our seats, I glance down at the signature. It's hard to decipher it but it definitely doesn't say 'James Bond'. My grandad looks at it, half figures out it says 'Roger Moore' - I have absolutely no idea who that is, and my hearts sinks. I tell my grandad he's signed it wrong, that he's put someone else's name - so my grandad heads back to Roger Moore, holding the ticket which he's only just signed.\n\n>I remember staying by our seats and my grandad saying \"he says you've signed the wrong name. He says your name is James Bond.\" Roger Moore's face crinkled up with realisation and he beckoned me over. When I was by his knee, he leant over, looked from side to side, raised an eyebrow and in a hushed voice said to me, \"I have to sign my name as 'Roger Moore' because otherwise...Blofeld might find out I was here.\" He asked me not to tell anyone that I'd just seen James Bond, and he thanked me for keeping his secret. I went back to our seats, my nerves absolutely jangling with delight. My grandad asked me if he'd signed 'James Bond.' No, I said. I'd got it wrong. I was working with James Bond now.\n\n>Many, many years later, I was working as a scriptwriter on a recording that involved UNICEF, and Roger Moore was doing a piece to camera as an ambassador. He was completely lovely and while the cameramen were setting up, I told him in passing the story of when I met him in Nice Airport. He was happy to hear it, and he had a chuckle and said \"Well, I don't remember but I'm glad you got to meet James Bond.\" So that was lovely.\n\n>And then he did something so brilliant. After the filming, he walked past me in the corridor, heading out to his car - but as he got level, he paused, looked both ways, raised an eyebrow and in a hushed voice said, \"Of course I remember our meeting in Nice. But I didn't say anything in there, because those cameramen - any one of them could be working for Blofeld.\"\n\n>I was as delighted at 30 as I had been at 7. What a man.

Of all the men who played James Bond, I think Roger Moore embraced the role and the character the most. He portrayed James Bond the most times and held that role for the longest stretch. His movies were seen as campy or silly to some, but I think that era was a strange time for cinema anyway... and now that I think about it, I think he really thought of himself as James Bond.\n\nThough it wasn't the greatest of his movies nor my favorite Bond movie, A View to a Kill stands out to me, oddly enough released 32 years ago tomorrow. It was the last time Moore portrayed my favorite character and the first Bond movie to be released in my lifetime. Roger Moore was 58 at the time but played the role as eager and wholeheartedly as his first go at Bond in Live and Let Die.\n\nWith my future wife's blessing, I started designing researching Bond posters as inspiration for a signing board for our wedding. I bought a book that contained a collection Bond posters for the past 50 years, and came across the poster for A View to a Kill. It showed James Bond and his Bond girl Stacy Sutton atop the Golden Gate Bridge, with villain Max Zorin chasing after them in his blimp. I thought it would be the perfect scene, though I would need to redo everything as we were getting married near New York City, and A View to a Kill depicted San Francisco. So I changed the Golden Gate to the Verrazano, and I replaced the San Francisco skyline with Manhattan. Then I made my wife my Bond girl in her wedding dress and I made myself James Bond holding my camera instead of a gun. I left as much as I could white so people could sign it, and we proudly display it in our dining room.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/5T8K1pe.jpg\n\nWith Roger Moore and Chris Cornell, who sang the theme to Casino Royale, this is a sad week for Bond fans. Roger Moore lived a good life and saw himself as James Bond to the very end.

I used my battered old dictaphone to record the Duran Duran song off my VHS of \"A View to a Kill\" because I couldn't afford the CD (which I eventually bought with a Golden Discs voucher).
