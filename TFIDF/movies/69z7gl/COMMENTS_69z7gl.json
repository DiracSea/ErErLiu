The droids in the original trilogy didn't move that way because special effects technology wasn't up to the task, it was just an aesthetic choice that called back to the old serials of the 1930s-1940s).\n\nIn *The Fifth Element* the cars all have a rough, industrial look that doesn't really fit with any style from the second half of the 20th century and *certainly* doesn't look anything like the cars that were being designed/built in the 1990s. The closest they come to any real-world aesthetic would probably be the 1930s-40s, but with a weird mix of 1970s-80s commercial vehicle design thrown in. Similarly the writing was already on the wall for physical mail, landlines, and CRTs by the mid-1990s, but nevertheless the film's depiction of the future doesn't really feel dated at all.\n\nEven *I Robot* comes to mind, as Chicago pretty much looks the same as it always has and the main character likes to collect \"vintage\" early-2000s CDs.\n\nI just saw the new *Guardians of the Galaxy* and while it's too early to say for sure I think it might have succeeded in this way too. I was noticing that all the control panels and seats in the main ship look like something from a 1970s Winnebago, while other scenes/locations range from cyberpunk to a weird mix of art deco and ancient Egyptian. Almost nothing in the movie looks \"futuristic\" by 2010s standards, and yet it *does* look like a believable sci-fi universe as a whole, which I think will make it age very well.", "created_utc": 1494291161.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dhb5ejl", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_69z7gl", "parent_id": "t1_dhb3xh6", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/69z7gl/blade_runner_2049_trailer_in_theaters_october/dhb5ejl/", "score": 195, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "obi1kenobi1", "author_id": "du45b", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "> ...and part of the success of that was that there were crappy 70s cars on the road, and shitty timber desks in dusty offices, etc. mixed in with the future-y stuff.

If you take for granted for a moment that, let\u2019s say, Deckard is a Nexus 7, he probably has an unknown life span and therefore is starting to get awfully human. Gaff, at the very end, leaves an origami, which is a piece of silver paper you might find in a cigarette packet, and it\u2019s a unicorn. Now, the unicorn in Deckard\u2019s daydream tells me that Deckard wouldn\u2019t normally talk about such a thing to anyone.

It is possible that some replicants were made without that limitation. I mean.. if you think about it Replicants are essentially clones and this is further reinforced by the non-canon novels that continue the movies where we are introduced to the \"real\" Roy Batty on which the Roy Batty replicants were all based on. Rachel is also a copy of Tyrell's niece who also exists in the novels.\n\nAlso, I know Scott has claimed that Deckard was a replicant. But I just don't follow along with his reasoning. There isn't enough evidence in the movie to really prove or disprove the theory and the unicorn dream doesn't mesh with the rest of the movie. Personally I choose to believe Deckard is human, which gives his decision to love and spare Rachel more emotional gravity than it would if he were simply \"protecting his own kind.\"\n\nFurther, Tyrell indicates that the memory implants that Rachel has that initially led her to believe she was human was a new thing. He could be lying in the face of another replicant but I see no reason for him to do so based on what is presented in the movie. In addition, the kind of implants Rachel has would prove disastrous to his business as it makes replicants harder to detect using Voight-Kampff testing. \n\n**tl;dr**: I don't think Deckard is a replicant, I am sure he is human despite Ridley Scott's claims after the fact. Rachel is clearly a replicant and as the \"happy ending\" is missing from most cuts of the original film it is possible that by the time Blade Runner 2049 takes place she has died due to the artificial 4-year life span.

People generally like Ridley Scott's changes and fucking hate George Lucas's.  I know it sounds glib but honestly that's a big deal.\n\n2.  Ridley Scott's position is that final cut of the movie was unfairly taken away from him and the existing version doesn't represent his artistic vision.  People sympathize with that argument and want to see the \"real\" version endorsed by the director, especially one of Scott's pedigree.  George Lucas has a similar argument but isn't as sympathetic as everyone knows that he had total control over everything at the time and is now just changing things because he feels like it.  \n\n3.  Finally, by far the most important factor, George Lucas has done everything in his considerable power to make sure that you absolutely cannot watch the original version of the star wars movies.  They simply are not available and you have to watch his edited versions.  Ridley Scott doesn't give a single fuck which version you watch and you can go to amazon and buy whatever version of the movie you prefer.  If Lucas said \"Hey, here's a new version of Star Wars I think you'll like but I'm also making an unedited version available in HD in case you prefer that one\" people would be ecstatic but what he actually says is \"Here's a new version of star wars, if you liked the old version better you're an idiot so I won't allow you to buy it anymore - better start looking for laserdiscs on ebay if you want to see it ever again.\" ", "created_utc": 1494281101.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dhaxq3v", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_69z7gl", "parent_id": "t1_dhaw9av", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/69z7gl/blade_runner_2049_trailer_in_theaters_october/dhaxq3v/", "score": 19, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Yeah.
