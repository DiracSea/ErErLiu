I'm in my upper twenties and have always loved comic characters, but mostly just the shows, movies, and video games. I had never bought a comic book. Listening to some of the explanations on these Youtube channels sparked a desire to actually buy the comic books. I bought an online membership to to DC universe and Marvel Unlimited because of it. I have even bought physical comics as well for stories that I found interesting on YouTube and wanted to physically read the whole comic. Typically the youtube videos just gloss over the basic story, giving you the plot but not the full story/dialogues.\n\nE-Comics are probably doing a lot better than they have before. Physical comics are probably not doing the best. In my case, there are no easy to access local comic shops. I have no interest in driving 30 minutes to the closest comic store to buy a comic. I imagine other people face the same issue depending on where they live.\n\nA common problem I experienced and have heard other people articulate is that comics are completely overwhelming. Where the hell do you start? Sure, I had always thought about reading batman, but where the hell do I start? Are they all connected from the original issues (I learned they are not). When are the reboots then? Which issues are \"alternate universes\"? Even for reboots, it isn't always as simple as \"Read Issue #1 of Dectetive Comics \\_\\_\\_\\_\". Sometimes character arcs start on issue #264 and then spin off into their own line. It is just massively overwhelming, but as I stated these youtubers have helped a ton. In the videos they will talk about where to start and even link to that specific issue in the description.\n\nJapanese mangas are typically very easy to find out where to start. You want to read Naruto? Cool, start with issue #1. It's all a giant story that has a clear starting point. You want to read ALL the Naruto comics? Cool, they sell a giant anthology that combines the issues into a handful of volumes.  While Marvel and DC sometimes will combine comic runs into single volumes, typically you need to buy everything individually. Do I really want to buy 300 comic books to read a single (long) storyline?\n\nMarvel and DC have gotten much better at this from what I can tell though. Instead of just a bunch of random standalone stories they have started focusing on long arcs that connect issues. You can go on their website and find pages that illustrate reading orders.
