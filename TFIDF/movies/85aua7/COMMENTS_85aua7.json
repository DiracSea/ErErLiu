When you read the headline, you think \"wow, a guy who wrote a screenplay about a very specific car managed to mention it to the one guy out of all seven and a half billion on earth who happened to own that car.\"\n\nIn reality, what happened was that the guy who wrote the screenplay had probably been looking for a similar looking car for quite a while, and had therefore asked at least a few people what kind of cars they owned. Specifically, he asked car enthusiasts, because those were the sort of people who might own the kind of car he needed. They also happened to be the kind of people who might coincidentally own famous cars. So rather than the pool of potential owners being seven and a half billion people, it was more along the lines of a few million.\n\nNow consider that at any given moment, there are probably a few dozen screenwriters wandering the U.S. looking for just the right car. Most of them will never find it. Most of them will never make their film. But if each of them asks ten to twenty car enthusiasts a year what kind of car they own, then the chances of something this coincidental happening at least once every few decades rise dramatically.\n\nIf something like this happens to *you*, then yeah, you should be downright amazed.
