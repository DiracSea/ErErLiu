And I\u2019m a nut for English accents! She said, 'May I help you?' And I took a look at her, and I think I said something crazy like, 'I love you.' I don\u2019t remember exactly.

This is Joanie.... My Wife.\n    Mum: Welcome to the family ! I always wanted a daughter!\n    Dad (to Stan): Good job son, she's gorgeous.\n\n--------\n\nStan met Joanie in 1947 and he fell in love with her instantly.
