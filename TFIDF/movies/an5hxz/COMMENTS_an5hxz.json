You just didn\u2019t hear about gruesomeness like this on the front page of your paper before this. No CSI or Criminal Minds to desensitize us to the gore.  Women always knew they were vulnerable to these types of crimes, but with Bundy any naive trust in a polite stranger was gone. Victims were attacked in their beds at night. And instead of educated wariness as taught in self-defense courses, women were left feeling terrorized and paranoid. Even after he was caught and we learned more about his crimes, that feeling sunk in. For many it was probably their first realization that people this evil walk among us, and are not as ugly on the outside as on the inside. The Bundy murders, coupled with the disappearance of Adam Walsh changed a lot of Floridians.   \n\nPlease do not glorify Bundy or gloss over the sheer heinousness of his crimes in the name of a couple hours of entertainment.
