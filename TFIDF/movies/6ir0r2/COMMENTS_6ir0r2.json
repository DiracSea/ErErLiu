Normally, people don't get off of serving time for stuff like that. Even high ranking politicians end up being disappeared or whatever.\n\nDespite this, Jackie's son seemed to have gotten off unscathed. Shortly following his son's acquittal/release Jackie's autobiography was re-released with edits to the section that mentioned how his parents met while his mother was a cocaine smuggler.\n\nAlso following this, Jackie released a series of mainland chinese dramas and action films, which was something he hadn't done before, probably given his hong kong roots (chow yun fat similarly got banned from making movies in mainland china during the umbrella protests and publically expressed that he didn't give a shit, since he wasn't mainland chinese anyway.) \n\nIf you've ever been to mainland china, there's a huge flood of action films, both western and chinese, but all of them share one commonality in their being heavily censored. Next to no blood, no gore, no nudity, no bad words...UNLESS you're killing japanese people. Because of mainland china's history with Japan, you can show pretty much any kind of mutilation, even on primetime tv, if it's happening to a Japanese person. In one famous example, a chinese officer straight up bisects a japanese soldier with his sword, on a tv drama during an afternoon broadcast.\n\nMainland Chinese government loves this kind of bloodthirsty patriotic shit like westerners love killing nazis in zombie and unzombified modes of nazi'ing. Jackie's railroad tigers wasn't quite that exaggerated, but normally you wouldn't see jackie killing people. Except if they're japanazi's, of course.\n\nThen there was the drama 1911, about mainland china fighting against Taiwan. This was made in 2011, two years after Jackie's son had his charges. In it, Jackie Chan AND HIS SON are both cast as mainland chinese revolutionaries. \n\n**tl;dr** Jackie Chan's movies got really violent and politically aligned with mainland china. It's totally my own theory with little evidence, but I'm a huge fan of Jackie's and read his autobiography over and over in its first print. I think the government made an agreement with Jackie to release his son, and now they've got him by the balls.
