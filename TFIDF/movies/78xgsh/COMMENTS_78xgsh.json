We can say name names all we want but as it is, the[ statute of limitations](https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/california-statute-of-limitations-on-sexual-abuse.html) on any of his cases is long over. Not only does he not have to say anything at all, it's not in his best interest to do so. The only legal battle to come from that at this point is a liable or slander lawsuit against Corey. So the people who violated him for years get to come back and do it again by taking the money he endured untold abuses to gain. I can't imagine voluntarily putting myself back in the control of my abusers and I can't blame him for not wanting to end up in this position.\n\nHe could also name names tomorrow but that doesn't mean any one has to give him a platform. For all the years pedophilia has been an \"Open Secret\" in Hollywood, the pedophiles have to have a pretty strong hold on the media to keep it from turning to public knowledge with accompanied public outcry. He's already an eccentric guy with a rep for being crazy, so even if the platform is there, many will discredit what he is saying.\n\nSo a documentary with thorough investigation, legal oversight for what can be said, multiple victims coming forward with their own stories, with independent distribution seems like the best way to be heard and make it count. $10 million seems a bit steep, but Indigogo will take it's cut off the top, plus distribution of donation incentive items, plus security for everyone involved, plus lawyers since it's a documentary calling out rich, well-connected people for being pedophiles, a very serious accusation, one to sue for. Not all of the $10 million will go directly to production. \n\nIt's your choice to support him or hate him for this, and I understand both sides of the coin. But given the circumstances, I think his is going about this in the best way he can to see that his story and other victims' stories are heard loud and clear.\n\nEdit to add: ([from a different comment of mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/78xgsh/corey_feldman_fundraising_10m_to_make_documentary/doxyxwc/)) The pedophilia issues of Hollywood are an \"Open Secret,\" there is even a documentary on it!

What I can't understand is the impetus to profit from whistle-blowing while delaying any potential for justice in lieu of servicing your greed, and while these perpetrators and pedophiles are still out there. As Corey said; at least one of the men who abused him is still working in a very powerful position in Hollywood. This means it is possible or even likely others are suffering and will continue to suffer until Corey raises $10 million and writes, produces, directs, and releases his, \"movie.\"\n\nSo, yes, good on Corey for expressing a desire to expose these assholes. But fuck him for asking the public to pay him to do it. And fuck him for staying quiet while others may be suffering. This is bullshit.\n\nLet me give this some context:\n\nI am not trying to be sanctimonious. I am in my forties and have worked in the film and television industry my whole life. I grew up in the Valley hanging out with Corey at parties when he wasn't off shooting movies. I know the guy. I watched as his life and career careened off the track. Corey is magnificent at playing the victim. That's not a judgment on his character, it is just who he is and to be fair he absolutely has been victimized. There are, as everyone now has firm proof, predators within our industry who prey on the young and vulnerable.\n\nWhen the story about Harvey broke, the industry became awash in a desire to see more of the truth exposed like I have never seen before. It's quite remarkable. This is a watershed moment, to be sure, and one that can make real change.\n\nI saw the footage with Corey and Barbara Walters, and thought to myself, 'Now is his chance. He has a real audience ready to listen to his story and dozens of industry professionals who will back him up. All he has to do is come out.' But, somehow I knew he would screw this up, which is exactly what he is doing.\n\n\nHe is muddying his message with bullshit about safety for himself, stories about nearly being killed, and a plea to raise $10 million to protect himself and shoot a bullshit movie that no one will want to see in theaters (no one goes to theaters anymore, by the way). Others are donating profits from their projects and their work (see Kevin Smith) to causes that are close to this subject. Meanwhile, Corey does the exact opposite. He looks to personally famewhore and profit. That's what he always does.\n\nMeanwhile, assuming Corey's claims are true, and I have no reason to think they couldn't be, there are predators out there who are probably victimizing other young actors and actresses. Predators Corey could stop RIGHT NOW. But he is choosing to wait.\n\nThe reality is, that movie will likely take 12 months, minimally, to make. Releasing it will take another period of time; months at least. That's 18-24 months, at least, that these people continue to victimize unabated because Corey wants to ride this wave famously and fiscally and make his movie, instead of just going on 20/20 or 60 Minutes or GMA or Pick-Your-Show-Here to name names.\nThat's shameful. Honestly. What if the movie NEVER gets released? What if he just takes whatever money he is making from his GOFUNDME - the same GOFUNDME he used to finance his albums and lifestyle - and says, \"I couldn't finish it,\" or, \"I couldn't get it released.\" That's a possibility, too.\n\nI understand wanting to support Corey. I want to support him, too.

The two most likely candidates are Bryan Singer, and Rob Reiner.\n\n**Singer** is more or less confirmed to have been involved in a number of legally questionable sexual situations, but a court case against him was recently dropped after the plaintiff was shown to have committed fraud. Others directly related to, and implicated in the Singer case include Garth Ancier, Garry Goddard, and David Neuman. All 4 of these men were principal investors in DEN, the network covered in An Open Secret. Singer himself is seen promoting DEN in the documentary, and was accused in multiple accounts of either knowingly, or unknowingly taking part in the alleged drugging and sexual assault of minors during his involvement in DEN.\n\nThe owners of DEN, Brock Pierce, Chad Shackley, and Marc Collins-Rector were all arrested for the sexual abuse of minors, with only Collins-Rector facing actual prison time, after being accused of raping drugged minors at gunpoint. Singer also was close friends with former Nickelodeon actor and producer for numerous kids shows, Brian Peck, convicted sex offender who plead guilty to sexual assault of a minor. Peck was featured in dual DVD commentary with Singer on one of Singer's films, the two having worked together closely at points in their career.  \n\nThere are several other anecdotes concerning Singer, some even made by posters in this thread. But a prominent rumor about him is his preference for young-looking gay men, while obsessively checking their IDs to confirm they are of legal age.\n\n**Reiner** fits all of the criteria perfectly, from his level of power and success, to his public image, to the age range, as well as having been directly involved in the direction or production of films/shows which Feldman and Haim starred in exactly around the time their sexual abuse is alleged to have happened. In a Comedy Central roast in 2000, former SNL writer-turned-Senator Al Franken made a tongue-in-cheek allusion to child rape and pedophilia when joking about Reiner. Haim is known to have spent time with Reiner at Reiner's home while auditioning for the film Stand By Me, which also featured Feldman, whom Haim accused of introducing him to the alleged pedophile. \n\nThere are others who make the list that are less convincing, such as Dominick Brascia (who a friend of Haim accused following his death), Oliver Stone(friend of Harvey Weinstein who defended him following recent sexual assault allegations, and accused of molestation of a Playboy model), and Stephen King (writer of several films direct by Reiner, including Stand By Me). \n\nAnd to be clear, I'm not saying Singer or Reiner did anything at all. I'm simply saying they are two people who happen to fit the criteria.", "created_utc": 1509076358.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "doy9gfo", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_78xgsh", "parent_id": "t1_doxi50v", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/78xgsh/corey_feldman_fundraising_10m_to_make_documentary/doy9gfo/", "score": 24, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "CptnLarsMcGillicutty", "author_id": "77rcc", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I see it as him trying to do what Leah Remini has done with her Scientology documentary. she has been saying all these things against scientology for years and nobody gave a damn or listened, but once she formatted her story and that of others who suffered as she did, it got way more attention than she ever had before.", "created_utc": 1509059748.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "doxvptn", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_78xgsh", "parent_id": "t1_doxlw2k", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/78xgsh/corey_feldman_fundraising_10m_to_make_documentary/doxvptn/", "score": 911, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "zaphod_beeble_bro", "author_id": "h0wld", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Sadly, he did name names in 1993 to the police while they were investigating Micheal Jackson.

What I do know are small tidbits we see on reality shows and interviews.  He seems to have a personality disorder.  He struggles to see anything outside his own problems.  I saw him on the Surreal Life program basically hijack the show and direct the final episodes to make it all about his impromptu wedding.  I thought the guy was fucking insane on that show.  He apparently said it was all edited out of context.  Ok I'll give him that one.  Then he goes on that Celeb Wife Swap show and I watch it only because it's Corey and I wanna see if he's gonna trainwreck.  Sweet jesus the guy was brainwashing troubled women into following his strict vegetarian diet and forcing them to exercise every day as one of his \"angels\". In return Corey will help them break into the industry.  It really seemed like a sex cult. He's gone on record that they don't \"have to have sex with me\" but it certainly helps.  From third hand stories, no men are allowed around Corey's harem unless they're bringing him more girls. If an \"angel\" decides to defect there is evidence that Corey leaves them threatening phone messages that he will black list them in Hollywood.  He wife swapped with some guy named Tommy.  Tommy got Corey's main angel or as he called her, his \"maingle\".  Corey treated Tommy's wife like a sex object, expecting her to follow his regime.  When the wives are given an opportunity to impose their standards on their swapped \"husbands\" she suggests that Corey's angels think for themselves and do what they want.  Corey flipped out.  He almost cried.  He literally said that he will not allow anyone to come into his house and \"reprogram\" his girls.\n\nIf Corey was victimized then he deserves justice.  But I don't think Corey understands what justice is.  Justice for Corey means \"I've been through a lot and now the world owes me fame for the rest of my life\".  And that isn't going to solve Hollywood's pedophile problem at all.  In fact he's getting in the way of it.  Corey isn't naming names for a good reason.  Once he does the spotlight will shift, and he can't have that.  He needs to dangle this information and release it in the most dramatic way possible and the main focus the entire time will be Corey.

I do doubt, however, that it would be anywhere near \"countless\".\n\nThere's a big difference between this type of child abuse and what Weinstein did. Weinstein manipulated adults and weilded his power of industry in grotesquely unethical ways; he coerced and arguably forced dozens of women into sexual acts by effectively withholding their livelihoods. But they were all *adult* women. They were old enough that they knew what he was doing was wrong but, because of the power Weinstein wielded, they couldn't deny him.\n\nWhat Feldman is trying to bring to bear is an entirely different beast. We as a society look at sexual deviants and pedophiles in wholly different lights. It is almost inarguable that the average pedophile is worse than the average rapist in our collective eyes. The amount of control and manipulation these people do to children is magnified because their victims *are children*, meaning their minds and behaviors are exponentially more malleable than an adults'. An adult women harassed or raped by Harvey Weinstein has the wisdom to know that if she comes out against Weinstein then his power crumbles. But to a child of abuse the power their abuser held over them doesn't work like that. Weinstein held success and money over the heads of these women, but an active pedophile (or group of pedophiles, in this case) have much, MUCH more to lose than Weinstein. He's facing a life in jail, but those pedophiles would be facing death. Plain and simple.\n\nThere are plenty of sexual deviants and sexual abusers in prison. They survive. You know who doesn't survive? People who fuck with kids.\n\nA ring of pedophiles is infinitely more likely to bust out the big unethical guns to avoid discovery than any abuser of adults, and the children they abuse who grow into adults know this. That's why it's so difficult to bring these types of rings down, because even in the face of all rational thought that these formerly abused adults will be protected, they cannot get over the mental hurdle that's been instilled in them since they were a child that if they tell anyone, they will surely regret it.", "created_utc": 1509064312.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1509125474.0, "id": "doxzgpo", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_78xgsh", "parent_id": "t1_doxw5y8", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/78xgsh/corey_feldman_fundraising_10m_to_make_documentary/doxzgpo/", "score": 8, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "The_Fad", "author_id": "h6nzc", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Chris Hansen didn\u2019t do that, though.
