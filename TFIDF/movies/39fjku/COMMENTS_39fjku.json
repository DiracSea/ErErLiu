I loved so many things about him and would like to share some of these things with you all. Many of these are likely to be repeated elsewhere in the thread.\n\n* His over 60 years in the business included over 200 films - notably including Dracula, the Star Wars prequels, and the Lord of the Rings/the Hobbit.\n* Before becoming an actor, he was a member of the British SAS and later a member of Winston Churchill's 'Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare', an elite team within the SAS. \n* He was the only member of the Lord of the Rings/Hobbit cast to actually meet J. R. R. Tolkien. \n* During the filming of LotR, Peter Jackson tried to coach him on the sound to make when Saruman is stabbed. Lee informed him that he was well aware how a man reacted upon being stabbed from first hand experience.\n* He was a frequent golfing partner of James Bond creator Ian Fleming and was allegedly one of Fleming's biggest inspirations in creating the Bond character. Lee was Fleming's personal choice for the role of Dr. No in the first Bond film, and while Lee didn't end up playing Dr. No, he did later play Francisco Scaramanga in The Man With the Golden Gun.\n* At 6 feet 5 inches, he held the Guinness World Record for tallest leading actor.\n* His operatic bass voice and taste for metal saw him collaborate with Rhapsody of Fire (one of my favourite bands of all time) as a narrator on four of their albums and in a duet on the track The Magic of the Wizard's Dream: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z93SdirnzTw\n* He later released his own metal album \"Charlemagne: By the Sword and the Cross\". \n* He became the oldest living performer to enter the music charts with his song Jingle Hell, one of the singles from his \"A Heavy Metal Christmas Too\" EP (one of his two metal Christmas EPs, because of course).\n\nI feel like I could write for hours. While I'm saddened by the loss of a great man, I feel that we as a world can count ourselves lucky that a man of Lee's calibre walked amongst us for 93 years and gave so much of himself to his passions and to the arts. \n\nVale Christopher Lee, 1922-2015.", "created_utc": 1434025528.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "cs2xsbw", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_39fjku", "parent_id": "t3_39fjku", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/39fjku/christopher_lee_veteran_actor_dies_at_93/cs2xsbw/", "score": 15, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Humeon", "author_id": "7jwpv", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "What a life, this is heartbreaking news.

He was even portrayed as an overly ambitious villainous character in the famed film, *Gandhi*. Annoyingly, Gandhi is portrayed a bit foolishly in *Jinnah*.  \n  \nHaving said that, within Pakistan I recall that there were a lot of criticisms of the film that were tied less to actual movie quality and more to xenophobic mentality.

When asked, his reply was \n\n\u201cI was attached to the SAS from time to time but we are forbidden \u2013 former, present, or future \u2013 to discuss any specific operations. Let's just say I was in Special Forces and leave it at that. People can read in to that what they like.\" \n\nIf you take the time to read Lee's past services, you'll soon come to realise how amazing this guy is.\n\n\n> When World War II broke out, Lee volunteered to fight for the Finnish forces during the Winter War in 1939. He and other British volunteers were kept away from actual fighting, but they were issued winter gear and were posted on guard duty a safe distance from the front lines. After a fortnight, they returned home. Lee returned to work at United States Lines and found his work more satisfying, feeling that he was contributing. In early 1940, he joined Beecham's, at first as an office clerk, then as a switchboard operator. When Beecham's moved out of London, he joined the Home Guard. In the winter, his father fell ill with double pneumonia and died on 12 March 1941. Realising that he had no inclination to follow his father into the Army, Lee decided to join up while he still had some choice of service, and volunteered for the Royal Air Force.\n\n> Lee reported to RAF Uxbridge for training and was then posted to the Initial Training Wing at Paignton. After passing his exams in Liverpool, the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan meant that he travelled on the Reina del Pacifico to South Africa, then to his posting at Hillside, at Bulawayo in Southern Rhodesia.  Training with de Havilland Tiger Moths, Lee was having his penultimate training session before his first solo flight when he suffered from headaches and blurred vision. The medical officer hesitantly diagnosed a failure of his optic nerve and he was told he would never be allowed to fly again. Lee was devastated and the death of a fellow trainee from Summer Fields only made him more despondent. His appeals were fruitless and he was left with nothing to do. He was moved around to different flying stations, before going to Salisbury in December 1941. He then visited the Mazowe Dam, Marandellas, the Wankie Game Reserve and the ruins of Great Zimbabwe. Thinking he should \"do something constructive for my keep\", he applied to join RAF Intelligence. His superiors praised his initiative and he was seconded into the Rhodesian Police Force and was posted as a warder at Salisbury Prison. He was then promoted to leading aircraftman and moved to Durban in South Africa, before travelling to Suez on the Nieuw Amsterdam.\n\n> After \"killing time\" at RAF Kasfareet near the Great Bitter Lake in the Suez Canal Zone, he resumed intelligence work in the city of Isma\u00eflia. He was then attached to No. 205 Group RAF before being promoted to pilot officer and attached to No. 260 Squadron RAF as an intelligence officer. As the North African Campaign progressed, the squadron \"leapfrogged\" between Egyptian airstrips, from RAF El Daba to Maaten Bagush and on to Mersa Matruh. They lent air support to the ground forces and bombed strategic targets. Lee, \"broadly speaking, was expected to know everything.\" The Allied advance continued into Libya, through Tobruk and Benghazi to the Marble Arch and then through El Agheila, Khoms and Tripoli, with the squadron averaging five missions a day. As the advance continued into Tunisia, with the Axis forces digging themselves in at the Mareth Line, Lee was almost killed when the squadron's airfield was bombed. After breaking through the Mareth Line, the squadron made their final base in Kairouan. After the Axis surrender in May 1943, the squadron moved to Zuwarah in Libya in preparation for the Allied invasion of Sicily. They then moved to Malta, and, after its capture by the British Eighth Army, the Sicilian town of Pachino, before making a permanent base in Agnone Bagni. After the Sicilian campaign was over, Lee came down with malaria for the sixth time in under a year. He was flown to a hospital in Carthage for treatment and when he returned, the squadron was restless. Frustrated with a lack of news about the Eastern Front and the Soviet Union in general, and with no mail from home or alcohol, unrest spread and threatened to turn into mutiny. Lee, by now an expert on Russia, talked them into resuming their duties, which much impressed his commanding officer.\n\n> After the Allied invasion of Italy, the squadron was based in Foggia and Termoli during the winter of 1943. Lee was then seconded to the Army during an officer's swap scheme. He spent most of this time with the Gurkhas of the 8th Indian Infantry Division during the Battle of Monte Cassino. While spending some time on leave in Naples, Lee climbed Mount Vesuvius, which erupted three days later. During the final assault on Monte Cassino, the squadron was based in San Angelo and Lee was nearly killed when one of the planes crashed on takeoff and he tripped over one of its live bombs. After the battle, the squadron moved to airfields just outside Rome and Lee visited the city, where he met his mother's cousin, Nicol\u00f2 Carandini, who had fought in the Italian resistance movement. In November 1944, Lee was promoted to flight lieutenant and left the squadron in Iesi to take up a posting at Air Force HQ] Lee took part in forward planning and liaison, in preparation for a potential assault into the rumoured German Alpine Fortress. After the war ended, Lee was invited to go hunting near Vienna and was then billeted in P\u00f6rtschach am W\u00f6rthersee. For the final few months of his service, Lee, who can speak fluent French and German, among other languages, was seconded to the Central Registry of War Criminals and Security Suspects. Here, he was tasked with helping to track down Nazi war criminals. Of his time with the organisation, Lee said: \"We were given dossiers of what they'd done and told to find them, interrogate them as much as we could and hand them over to the appropriate authority ... We saw these concentration camps. Some had been cleaned up. Some had not.\" Lee then retired from the RAF in 1946 with the rank of flight lieutenant.\n\n> Intriguingly, Lee's stepfather served as a captain in the Intelligence Corps, but it is unlikely he had any influence over Lee's military career. Lee saw him for the last time on a bus in London in 1940, by now divorced from Lee's mother, though Lee did not speak to him. Lee mentioned that during the war he was attached to the Special Operations Executive and the Long Range Desert Patrol, the precursor of the SAS, but always declined to go into details.\n\n\n**TL;DR** seriously, just read it.", "created_utc": 1434023193.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1434024943.0, "id": "cs2wxjo", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_39fjku", "parent_id": "t1_cs2wsyg", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/39fjku/christopher_lee_veteran_actor_dies_at_93/cs2wxjo/", "score": 1661, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "petrichorE6", "author_id": "dcx4n", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "[He also made this heavy metal Christmas song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVzOve8T39w) ", "created_utc": 1434023084.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "cs2ww7r", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_39fjku", "parent_id": "t1_cs2wsyg", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/39fjku/christopher_lee_veteran_actor_dies_at_93/cs2ww7r/", "score": 88, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "HowieGaming", "author_id": "61aru", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "[Here he is singing about the wonders of alcohol from The Return of Captain Invincible](https://youtu.be/T9MuEA2eF8c)", "created_utc": 1434023299.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "cs2wyvk", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_39fjku", "parent_id": "t1_cs2wsyg", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/39fjku/christopher_lee_veteran_actor_dies_at_93/cs2wyvk/", "score": 20, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Number-6", "author_id": "d5vkt", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I gotta say that music video is so lame and low quality.

The SAS did conduct that raid but there is no reason to assume Lee was part of it, especially because he was stationed in Africa and Southern Europe. Perhaps the confusion comes from this [site](http://www.badassoftheweek.com/christopherlee.html):\n\n> After working with the LRDP (Long Range Desert Patrol), Lee was assigned to the Special Operations Executive \u2013 better known as Winston Churchill's Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare \u2013 a group that did shit like lead a twelve-man assault that destroyed the German top secret nuclear weapons development facility in Norway and assist brave Eastern European partisans and rebels sabotage Nazi supply lines to prevent them from bringing reinforcements up to fight the Soviets. His service records are sealed and Lee doesn't talk much about his service (when pressed on the subject, he reportedly asks his interviewer, \"Can you keep a secret?\". When they excitedly say yes, he leans in close and says, \"So can I.\"), but we do know that by the time he retired as a Flight Lieutenant in 1945 he'd been personally decorated for battlefield bravery by the Czech, Yugoslavian, English, and Polish governments and was good friends with Josip Broz Tito, so draw your own conclusions. \n\nEDIT2: This is not to say Lee was not a Total Badass! Personally I think it is more likely he did his work with partisans in (South)Eastern Europe. Hence his decorations from Czech, Yugoslavian and Polish governments. \n\nEDIT3: All British personal involved in the mission on the ground in Norway were either killed in glider crashes or captured and executed by the Gestapo, see [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_heavy_water_sabotage). \n", "created_utc": 1434023814.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1434029664.0, "id": "cs2x5by", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_39fjku", "parent_id": "t1_cs2wxjo", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/39fjku/christopher_lee_veteran_actor_dies_at_93/cs2x5by/", "score": 147, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "henkiedepenkie", "author_id": "76py9", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "He was one of the few Bristish people to volunteer to fight on the Finnish side in the Russo-Finnish winter war in 1939-1940, though he and his fellow British volunteers were in Finland only for about two weeks and were kept well away from direct combat.\n\nEdit: One of the few brits.
