[{"body": "Here is the full post he made on instagram . \n\n> thatkevinsmith I was trying to do a killer standup special this evening but I might\u2019ve gone too far. After the first show, I felt kinda nauseous. I threw up a little but it didn\u2019t seem to help. Then I started sweating buckets and my chest felt heavy. Turns out I had a massive heart attack. The Doctor who saved my life at the #glendale hospital told me I had 100% blockage of my LAD artery (also known as \u201cthe Widow-Maker\u201d because when it goes, you\u2019re a goner). If I hadn\u2019t canceled the second show to go to the hospital, the Doc said I would\u2019ve died tonight. For now, I\u2019m still above ground! But this is what I learned about myself during this crisis: death was always the thing I was most terrified of in life. When the time came, I never imagined I\u2019d ever be able to die with dignity - I assumed I\u2019d die screaming, like my Dad (who lost his life to a massive heart attack). But even as they cut into my groin to slip a stent into the lethal Widow-Maker, I was filled with a sense of calm. I\u2019ve had a great life: loved by parents who raised me to become the individual I am. I\u2019ve had a weird, wonderful career in all sorts of media, amazing friends, the best wife in the world and an incredible daughter who made me a Dad. But as I stared into the infinite, I realized I was relatively content. Yes, I\u2019d miss life as it moved on without me - and I was bummed we weren\u2019t gonna get to make #jayandsilentbobreboot before I shuffled loose the mortal coil. But generally speaking, I was okay with the end, if this was gonna be it. I\u2019ve gotten to do so many cool things and I\u2019ve had so many adventures - how could I be shitty about finally paying the tab. But the good folks at the Glendale hospital had other plans and the expertise to mend me. Total strangers saved my life tonight (as well as my friends @jordanmonsanto & @iamemilydawn, who called the ambulance). This is all a part of my mythology now and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be facing some lifestyle changes (maybe it\u2019s time to go Vegan). But the point of this post is to tell you that I faced my greatest fear tonight... and it wasn\u2019t as bad as I\u2019ve always imagined it\u2019d be. I don\u2019t want my life to end but if it ends, I can\u2019t complain. It was such a gift. #KevinSmith\n\nGet well soon /u/ThatKevinSmith", "created_utc": 1519638861.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "duufxz1", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_80biy5", "parent_id": "t3_80biy5", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/80biy5/kevin_smith_in_hospital_recovering_from_a_heart/duufxz1/", "score": 11073, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Sid_00", "author_id": "5um0i", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Jeez.

This often gets said, but consider the implications here.  Most people you know, among all the (non-natural) causes of possible death, are most likely to ultimately succumb to heart disease.  I only point this out to emphasize the seriousness and pervasiveness of the disease, and to encourage people to make lifestyle changes accordingly.\n\n**2)** Heart disease is a *lifetime* disease, and likely begins *in utero*, i.e. in your mother's womb, due to her potentially poor lifestyle and eating habits.  [Anatomic changes in the heart due to heart disease are significant enough to commonly show up when children are only ~5-8 years old](https://www.clersite.org/bogalusaheartstudy/).  The idea here being that heart disease isn't something that only happens once you're already older and out of shape, it's something that was already happening through, quite literally, your entire lifespan, even before you were born.\n\nKevin Smith might well have lost a bunch of weight, but that doesn't erase the decades of damage he may have done to himself prior.  In the same way that quitting smoking after 30 years doesn't mean you won't get lung cancer.\n\n**Edit**: just for a quick disclaimer because I don't want to be misunderstood, it's **obviously good** that Kevin Smith lost a bunch of weight through what I'm assuming are healthy lifestyle changes.  I'm just pointing out that doing so isn't a guarantee for perfect health, or make him heart attack proof.  We can't go back in time, so the next best thing is to alter our course towards a healthier lifestyle as soon as possible.

That would be the bare minimum to know if cholesterol itself should be of any concern to you at all. Then you can add and combine it with related Lipoproteins for better accuracy.\n\n\n\n\nMineral and vitamin levels should be evaluated as well. From minerals mainly calcium, total and active, that can be as harmful as cholesterol and similarly build up in various places. Then potassium to see if your heart has enough fuel, along with magnesium to support it, which could contribute to other issues. Sodium is important too. As for vitamins, B12 is good to know with various levels of iron for oxygen and you can throw in vitamin D also that works in tandem with the aforementioned calcium - and isnt just for bones.\n\n\n\n\nAfter this you should have a relatively good, although still fairly basic, idea how you're doing.\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to go all out with the blood tests, get some inflammation and heart markers done too. CRP is a start for general inflammation, higher levels (for example during illness) increase risk slightly, with hsCRP being more sensitive to heart itself. But a lot more useful and specific would be getting BNP levels as it shows basically how much the muscle is damaged. It also costs more though just like Troponin. \n\n\n\n\nKnowing how your kidneys are doing, which affect the heart too, would be ideal for a complete image. For that get creatinine, urea and acid levels, theres also a thing called Cystatin C which is like a crystal ball, and urine analysis with ultrasound. If your kidneys are fine then less stuff to potentially worry about.\n\n\n\n\nThen visit a cardiologist. Get a EKG and heart ultrasound. Thats what they usually start with and its usually enough to know with certain certainty if youre ok. Modern ultrasound is pretty smart. If they find something peculiar theyll go from there. Theres a stress test EKG, internal ultrasound and other less comfortable stuff like going inside the heart/arteries directly (through hand or groin) to get be 100% sure and potentially correct any damage. Chest X-ray, which is basic, will show you if your heart is enlarged and how your lungs are looking. Should your blood levels be off you might also go for a CT scan targeting that area for calcium and other stuff. Theres even MRI.\n\n\n\n\nIf you get all of the above actually done and nothing is found then its quite unlikely for you to die from a heart attack anytime soon. Of course you never know and a lot of stress on its own can over time be deadly for anyone, but you should at least sleep better at night knowing that the tests havent found anything troubling.

Eat well, and eat slowly so your body can tell you it's full sooner. A nutritionist can be helpful, and perhaps your doctor can recommend one.\n\n*Be willing to change your plan.
