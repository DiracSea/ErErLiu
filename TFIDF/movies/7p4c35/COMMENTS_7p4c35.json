Direction is a job that links the screenplay to the final product and it's all about how the movie was brought to life. The director is supposed to bring out the best performances from the actors but he/she also acts as the interpreter of the script. In a way, the balance of the film is brought by the director. A good script can only go so far - a good director will do it justice on the screen. \n\nIt's hard to explain the job of a director because it's not very clearly defined, but when a director has a strong presence on the screen and completely spearheads the project, you can *feel* it. Auteurs like Hitchcock and Kubrick amongst many others brought this brilliant cohesiveness to their films which wouldn't have worked with the same script and the same actors if it weren't for their direction. I'm not comparing Gerwig's direction in Lady Bird to Kubrick in terms of quality but I guess what I'm trying to say is that it was a very well executed and cohesive project albeit being very simple at its core. That, to me, shows excellence in directing. I felt the same way about Barry Jenkins and Damien Chazelle after watching Moonlight and La La Land last year.", "created_utc": 1515510214.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dsf2i2t", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7p4c35", "parent_id": "t1_dsf11df", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7p4c35/guillermo_del_toros_golden_globe_win_for/dsf2i2t/", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "arhanv", "author_id": "lgiwi", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "> This obsession of needing women for female led movies and black guys for movies led by black characters is stupid.\n\nI always hated this.
