Pastore may be the most unfairly vilified figure in any viral video ever. This video is always presented as \"Mister Rogers facing down the gruff, mean anti-PBS politician who's trying to kill quality children's television\" and that's really not what's happening at all. The truth is, Pastore was there because he was the biggest advocate PBS had in Washington. Pastore hated children's television offerings by the major networks (he had complained so loudly the previous year that it caused the networks to cancel a slew of cartoons that he deemed unacceptable). He thought public TV needed funding because he thought it was a worthy alternative to commercial children's TV.\n\nRichard Nixon was wary that the Ford Foundation, a group that had funded some fiercely slanted documentaries on public TV in the 1960s, would wield too much influence over the newly-formed Corporation for Public Broadcasting and wanted the budget slashed in half because he didn't want to fund programming that he expected to be anti-Nixon. This hearing was held so that advocates for educational TV could come forward and plead their case that they were doing good work with the government funding they were getting.\n\nPastore, again, portrayed most of the time as being anti-PBS, actually opened the hearings with this statement: \"\u201cThe Corporation is now a viable entity. During the short time that it has been in operation, it has made plans for, and in some cases actually begun, providing broadcast programs of diversity and, I must say, excellence; establishing an experimental interconnection distribution project; and supporting and strengthening local noncommercial stations.\"\n\nAnd that's the reason he snaps at Mister Rogers early on. He'd made it very clear that he's in favor of continuing to fund the effort. So when Mister Rogers leads off by expressing his concern that Senator Pastore hasn't read the written statement in advance, Pastore reacts with the tone of a guy who's basically thinking, \"You get that I'm on YOUR side, right?\" As much as we want to think of Mister Rogers as infallible, the truth is, this video shows Mister Rogers committing a bit of a faux pas and Senator Pastore calling him out on it.\n\nAs far as Pastore's statement at the end, \"Looks like you just earned the $20 million,\" again, this moment didn't singlehandedly swing anything. It's not Pastore saying \"I'm in charge of this $20 million and now you can have all of it!\" He's telling Mister Rogers, \"Wow, good speech, dude.\"\n\nSo yes, it's a great speech, and yes, Mister Rogers probably did a lot toward ensuring fuller funding for PBS...but Senator Pastore isn't the villain in this video, and Mister Rogers did nothing that changed his mind about anything.
