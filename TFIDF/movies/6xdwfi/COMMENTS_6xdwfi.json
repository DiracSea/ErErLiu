Some can afford visiting pro sports ( basketball)  and then actually meet them in person - maybe. Even then, there aren't as many that are 7 footers as people think. \n\nI've only met two people in person that were around this size and it's.... a little surreal honestly. I was a reasonably tall 6'3\" and my peak (started shrinking sadly; stupid aging), and the first time I met someone this tall was a friend of my dad's when I was in college. He was 6'11\". Shaking his hands was like instantly being teleported back in time to being 7 and meeting an adult and you had to shake their hand. I felt awkward and weird cause his hands were basically baseball mits. I followed him to another room and fell in step behind him and I was looking at the middle of his back. When you are used to looking over most people's heads it is a little weird. \n\nThe second time was my 15 year high school reunion. Some girl in our class married a giant. Seriously. This guy was 7'4\". And not an athletic tall either. He was overweight and built like a normal fat dad, but you know... the size of a mountain. I went to greet him and realized he was sitting and I was basically looking him almost in the eye. When he talked it sounded like boulders  tumbling off a cliff. It was just an undulating bass with no discernable inflection for words. I felt bad but I literally understood nothing he said. \n\nI always wanted to be tall when I was a kid, and though I had hoped for 6'4\" and I got pretty close, I know now that being super tall and big like that is not necessarily a great life. Joints and organs often fail at a much higher rate and I suspect many people this size find much in everyday life that just wasn't made for their size. I've had to get off one roller coaster because my legs from hip to knee were literally too long for the enclosure to close the lap bar and I'm in the \"normal tall\" range. I can fit on a bed, in a car, and in a shower, and my hands can hold a phone and dial buttons (though they are tiny for me).
