He's always been a tall and lanky type up until the last 5 to 10 years or so. If he's an ectomorph, maintaining that bulk requires regular training and a solid diet. So being lanky for the role is probably possible for him and easier to pull off within a month's time. He'll still probably look buff, but if he's an exceptional fighter and military man, I don't think that's absurd and I don't remember the character having to take his shirt off.\n\n**Second,** is that **of all the candidates suggested in this thread for Duncan, Momoa is the only one with actual and extensive weapons training**. It's been a key element to him being cast in pretty much every one of his major projects since the beginning of his career if you think about it. \n\nStargate Atlantis, the flop remake of Conan, Game of Thrones, Aquaman are all roles that relied heavily on his weapons skills. I'd argue that his \"TV/Movie\" weapons style, full of flourishes, while not exactly efficient or accurate, is in fact the best weapons handling we've seen showcased from a major action star in triple A titles in a VERY long time. On par with the solid work done by Christopher Lee (who would have been ***perfect*** for the role a few decades prior) in the Star War prequels and Cary Elwes and co. in the Princess Bride. \n\nAn added bonus of his flashy \"Hollywood style\" of fighting is that usually his defence is plot armour, but in the case of Dune that plot armour would be replaced by the presence of a shield. He fights with reckless abandon and excessive showmanship because he does not *need* to worry about defending himself. Work perfectly for Duncan imho. \n\n**Final point,** the timeline for shooting makes him the only choice. Sure he's a bigger guy and kinda gruffy but ultimately it's either him or Keanu with a year to prep when it comes to big stars who could pull off \"martial mastery\".\n\nSince they are shooting in a month or so, then he's the only real choice to portray a character with exceptional martial skills who will have lines to read. Like Keanu he'll need to be clean shaven, coached to have a more military demeanour and have lines writen for him that are plenty of witty charm. In the witty charm department, I'd again favour him over Keanu despite loving Keanu. It's just not his thing. \n\nI'm sure that when it comes out, after his first smile and wisecrack people will forget he was ever a controversial choice for the role IMHO.", "created_utc": 1550205817.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1550206152.0, "id": "egidppr", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_aqq2a1", "parent_id": "t1_egi2h1z", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/aqq2a1/aquamans_jason_momoa_joins_killer_cast_of_denis/egidppr/", "score": 25, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "IBoris", "author_id": "4ao5h", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Yeah this is the first straight up bad casting choice I\u2019ve seen with this movie.
