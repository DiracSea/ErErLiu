I was deeply honored to meet him back in 1994, when his Acura Legend was towed into Beverly Hills Honda and Acura, where I served as an Assistant Service Manager...\n\nA beautiful, and very pregnant young woman appeared, and identified herself as Mr. Stanton's personal assistant...\n\nNo...  The baby wasn't Harry's...  Just for the record...\n\nAfter our Technicians examined the car, we found out that the main engine wiring harness had been chewed through by rats...\n\nNow, Harry lived in one of the canyons in the LA area.  I don't remember which one.  These are teeming with wildlife, and such a situation isn't unknown.\nMost of the Hollywood \"anointed ones\" wouldn't interact with a lowly Service Writer, and would send assistants to work out the details of repairs and maintenance on their cars...\n\nI will never forget the phone call I received from him concerning what his assistant had told him...\n\nHe said \"What the fuck are you telling my assistant, that my wiring was eaten by a fucking rat?\"\n\nI paused for a heartbeat, knowing the phrasing of my answer would either offend, enrage, or amuse him, and said \"Yes, Harry, your wiring harness was eaten by a fucking rat!\"\n\nOne second, two seconds, then three ticked by, and as I was about to start thinking about updating my resume, my ear was assailed by a burst of hearty laughter...\n\n\"Well I'll be fucked!  I gotta see this.  I'm coming down there.\"  True to his word, he was there within 30 minutes.\n\nAfter inspecting the ruined harness, he approved the repairs, which were around $1400.00.  This was quite a sum back in the nineties.   We couldn't just patch it.  The harness was thoroughly destroyed, and it had to be entirely replaced.\n\nI was astonished as well as grateful that he took a personal interest in me, and started asking questions.  I told him a brief history, including the fact I was a musician.  Singer, songwriter, and guitarist.\n\nWhen I had confided this, his eyes lit up, and he told me \"I got a band!  We play blues, and we're playing at (some club) tonight, and you could bring your guitar and do a set!\"\n\nAs I had a 60+ hour-per-week-job in one of the most high stress business environments known to OSHA, and was working for my best friend, who was the Service and Parts Director, I had to make the wrenching decision to decline.  In addition to the working hours, I spent a total of 2 and a half hours commuting to and from work every day.  A guy's gotta sleep sometime!\n\nI will never forget how, in a few seconds, over a phone conversation, he had sized me up and apparently, decided I might make a good addition to his \"posse\".  I deeply regret not being able to hang out with, and develop a closer friendship with this amazing man.\n\nHe was one of the greatest character actors in the history of cinema, and for all those years since, I have regarded him as a treasured friend...\n\nGod rest you Harry Dean Stanton.
