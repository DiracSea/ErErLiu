It can best be described as a well with a rope descending into it with an overall subdued or foreboding tone. My idea is that someone in the past sacrificed a child to It through the well either to protect the rest of Derry or just to gain some specific boon unto themselves. This is supported by the first movie in three ways. The above mentioned foreshadowing. Second in  final moments of the movie where it offers the rest of the gang to go untouched if they leave Bill(Sacrifice willingly an innocent). Lastly the directors mentioned that there was a particularly disturbing scene of the Origins of It in Derry that had to be cut due to time constraints. They mentioned it may come in unrealized scenes later or may be incorporated into the next film.
