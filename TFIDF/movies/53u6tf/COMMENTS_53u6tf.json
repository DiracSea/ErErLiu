The weapon in question here is the shotgun. The shotgun is generally a tricky bastard to load quickly. Why is it a tricky bastard to load quickly? Well that is due to the nature of its rimmed cartridge (the shotgun shell) not being great at being contained in a traditional magazine, the types most rifles and pistols use. Tube magazines are great for rimmed and flat cartridges, they are almost exclusively used where rimmed cartridges are concerned. This excledues 22lr however, as it is very small.\n\nAnyway, shotguns, shotguns generally have a very large breach because fired shotgun shells are very large. It is pretty easy to reach under the shotgun and slide a shell into the breach, then the chamber, without looking so long as you have a shell in your hand already. There is a little holder just forward of the breach on Keanu's shotgun, it holds a single shell so that you dont have to. If the breach of the shotgun is already open you can reach under the shotgun and slide the round in the holder back and into the breach. You can see him press a little button as we puts his hand back to shooting position, that is the bolt release and it carries the round home to the chamber. \n\nFor many 3 gunners this is useful because it takes .5 seconds to load the single shell in position unlike the 5 seconds it takes to find a round and put it in. This allows you to hit one last target in case you missed one shot. One missed shot on a shotgun stage could add 5-20 seconds onto your time. \n\n\nJerry Miculek is sort of considered the best shooter of all time, he is crazy good at it. He has held world records in almost every shooting discipline at some point in his life. He used to be the worlds fasted revolver shooter by a longshot. These days he messes around with other disciplines and to make all the young kids angry a grampa is beating them.
