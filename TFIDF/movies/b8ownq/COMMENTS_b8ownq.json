I think it came out to 54 hours in total...was in the basement of my dorm with other friends circling in and out for a few movies at a time over the course of one very long weekend. \n\nI planned it all out with small breaks in between every movie, larger breaks every 5 or 6, and brought a ton of snacks/was close to a restroom.  It honestly wasn't that bad, though I definitely fell asleep during some of them...was keeping a live blog of sorts and it's fun to review for a couple of reasons.  First, you can tell which movies I slept through based on the lack of notes, and second, you can chart my descent into sleep deprived insanity.\n\nNow, the Bond series covered a LOT more time and was considerably less organized than the MCU, so it was fascinating seeing 6 lead actors and a bunch of different directors' takes on the character, and cool to witness the time pass from the quality of effects, scene work and filmmaking in the early 60s to the late 00s.\n\nI can't really afford this one and the available seats in my area aren't the best for that long of an experience, but if things were different I would've at least considered this.  With the MCU you have a lot more connective tissue, a vision \u2010 and a Vision - plus a semi-actual \"ending\" to build up to, while in my marathon the last movie out was Quantum of Solace, not exactly a big finish.
