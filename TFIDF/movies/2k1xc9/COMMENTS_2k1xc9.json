Would make for a really interesting twist on the usual \"Hulk Smash!\" rampage dynamic - Iron Man is the aggressor and Hulk the defender.\n\nNotice that there are a few shots where police/soldiers are shooting at something out of frame - would be interesting if this is deliberate, as they are actually shooting at Stark and Whedon doesn't want to spoil the reveal yet.\n\nMight this be why Thor is so furious with Stark? The clips are out of order in the trailer and this happens after the IM/Hulk battle. He's angry that Stark created something (Ultron) that could exploit his technology and subvert the Iron Man suits.\n\nTony/Iron Man only appears with the team in a few of those clips, and they look like they might come from the same (or closely connected) scenes.. In others it's IM vs Hulk, or the team with Stark being notably absent. \n\nI'm starting to get a real \"The Fall of Tony Stork\" vibe from all of this now. Stark's hubris creates Ultron, Ultron subverts Stark's technology and uses it to defeat the Avengers, Tony creates the Vision from the remnants of fallen Ultron's and uses him to defeat his \"child\". \n\nCybernetic brother vs brother, father/creator falling and rising, a team \"betrayed\" by one of their own, man vs machine, man vs beast (Id/Hulk) - yeah, this is Whedon's Empire Strikes Back meets his low budget Shakespeare...\n\nEdit 2: not even going to change Tony Stork, enjoy all of your upvotes!

In that original Disney movie, Pinocchio is forced to sing that very song on stage as part of a freak show. Now watch the trailer again at (0:32). Notice how Ultron (looking rather shabby) walks forward onto an open area with what looks like curtains in the background. The shot cuts to the Avengers all watching this unfold from a balcony above Ultron. It's very much like a staged performance. This is pretty direct visual nod to \"I've got no strings on me\" in a trailer which already incorporates verbal and musical cues from the song, strengthening the reference.\n\n* We already know from previous interviews and articles that Stark builds Ultron to give the Avengers a break from saving the world, in other words, a puppet. The new bit of information we get from this trailer is that Ultron is gonna flip that script on the Avengers. Instead of Ultron being the puppet, he reverses that notion by saying to Stark and Co., \"You want to protect the world, but you don't want it to change. You're all puppets, tangled...and with strings\". This line is clever in establishing that \"strings\" to Ultron are motivations, the things that make us tick. Thor wants to save Jane AND save Nine Realms, Cap wants to preserve liberty AND keep people safe, Stark wants to be a superhero AND a playboy. As Ultron points out, our countless motivations are oftentimes at odds with each other, leading to a \"tangled\" situation. Since Ultron has no moral compass (he's just a computer program) and a singular goal (Stark programmed him to save the planet), he's never \"tangled\" like us humans (especially individuals like the Avengers with enormous responsibilities). As Ultron puts it \"I've got no strings on me\". Its remarkable the twist Whedon put on the Pinocchio theme. He turns a song originally about being free to pursue a full life (albeit with the dark undertone of naivete and being taken advantage of) and spins the same message into a 3-dimensional motivation for a supervillain like Ultron. Hats off to Joss.\n\nWow. I did not plan on that going on as long as it did. Holy shit its 11pm. Bed Time.

Hence linking the Ant-Man film to Avengers 2, ultimately setting in motion Ant-Man to appear in Avengers 3.\n\n* I honestly believe the battle between Hulkbuster and Hulk is actually between Stark and Banner, as it is apparent that it is an Iron Man suit commanding the Hulkbuster.  This could be implications of exiling Hulk as expanded a bit more a couple points below.\n\n* Jane Foster will die, leading to rising tension between Thor and Stark, as depicted by Thor choking Stark. Thank you /u/bosoxlover12\n\n* Serkis' character, Klaw, is the one to coat Ultron in Vibranium.  You see the first form as the broken droid.  Thank you /u/jormugandr \n\n* Hulk will see a lot of internal conflict in this film, as seem by the many shots of Ruffalo crawling, in agony.  Something must be catalyzing this despair which in turn makes the Hulk uncontrollable.  (Ultron using Loki's plan of provoking the wildcard?)\n\n* At the conclusion of the film, Hulk will be sent to another galaxy, specifically the one that the Guardians reside in.  When Ruffalo finally gets his own film, they may explore this topic.  This would suggest a tie into Guardians of the Galaxy 2 and be another set up for Avengers 3.  I'm guessing a Hulk meets Thanos situation?  Also, I'm really hoping for Hulk to appear in the end-credits scene for Guardians of the Galaxy 2, solidifying that storyline.  Thank you /u/TheGhost118\n\n* I honestly believe Whedon will spend a good chunk of time developing the characters of Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, as they are seen in the same shot with an Ultron post-vibranium coat.  This would suggest they initially start on Ultron's side.  In one of the many possible revelations of the movie, Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver are expected to turn tide and join the Avengers.  Scarlet Witch's reality bending powers will be a pivotal point in exploiting any weakness Ultron has.  (She will probably discover this weakness when she is initially on Ultron's side.)  Thank you, /u/Acora \n\n* Captain America's broken shield is most likely broken due to a fight with Ultron, but this may not be the final fight in the film, perhaps earlier on after Ultron gets his Vibranium coating.  Something about the lighting reminds me of the early fight scene between Thor, Captain America, and Iron Man in the first Avengers.  Thank you /u/smsy \n\n* Also, Captain America's death is slated for his third film, as Chris Evans is stepping away from acting.  Perhaps CA3 will be him searching for Bucky.  Thank you /u/pewpewlasors\n\n* Keeping in mind this is post-CA2 S.H.I.E.L.D., the organization should be in shambles.  As much as I would like a lot of Nick Fury L. Jackson screentime, I don't see S.H.I.E.L.D. taking up a lot of screentime, especially if Whedon is introducing Scarlet Witch / Quicksilver / Ultron.\n\n* As for Hawkeye, the trailer shows him running through a forest, while Hydra weapons are being fired upon him.  This is a curious scene, due to the weaponry.  I'm not entirely sure of the implications, but interesting nonetheless.  Perhaps the movie begins with Fury calling in the team to hunt down Hydra, before all the Ultron stuff goes down.\n\n* The first Avengers spent a deal of time with the Hulk / Black Widow storyline, showing Hulk lose control and chase her down.  I don't believe Whedon will follow that again.  This trailer shows the infamous hands shot between the two characters.  I'm not particularly fond of that romantic pairing, but it's reminiscent of Beauty and the Beast. \n\nI hope you've enjoyed my purely speculative analysis of the trailer and this thread. :)\n\nEDIT: Forgot a last point.  JARVIS is definitely going to become Vision, as shown by the illustration released by Marvel, and as confirmed on imdb and the comicon panel.  He'll start on Ultron's side and defect to the Avengers, as well.  I am so excited to see how Whedon orchestrates this orgy of storylines, while simultaneously providing enough backstory on each character to have a viewer feel for them.\n\nEDIT #2: As /u/Mughi has pointed out, Klaw creates a springboard for Black Panther, as well.
