There are some fairly vitriolic folks out there who maintain the opinion that women can't act, can't be funny, or whatever other nonsense those people spew. The thing is, my thoughts had absolutely nothing to do with the characters' gender, and I was frustrated that I was being thrown in alongside the bigots. Worst still, when I tried to explain my opinion, I was told that I was just rationalizing; that I was secretly a misogynist who hated the idea of a female in a leading role.\n\nIn response, [I edited the \"Ghostbusters\" trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBPlyAtpFVc) to exemplify my point.\n\nI've made the same complaint about every reboot, remake, and reimagining, regardless of whether the featured actors had internal or external genitalia. Usually, the topic doesn't even come up. (For instance, I complained about \"The Force Awakens\" being a shot-for-shot remake of \"A New Hope,\" and nobody accused me of being upset about Rey.) Most people really couldn't care less about that detail, provided that the characters and the story are written well. Hell, there have been plenty of times when I've seen folks actively speaking out against flimsy female placeholders in film... which usually occurs when the \"female lead\" could be replaced by an inanimate object with no detriment to the plot.\n\nMy problem is that the film looks like a shameless ripoff.\n\nMaybe this is naive of me, but I'm sick of unoriginal stories being sold for a profit. Adapting a book to the silver screen is usually fine, because it's a new form of media. The motivation should be to entertain people, though, not to cash in on some social trend or another. (I'm looking at you, \"Fifty Shades of Grey.\") There's absolutely no reason why writers and filmmakers can't offer something unique and still make a living, even though the vast majority of movies being released nowadays seem to imply otherwise.\n\nAnyway, my issue with the new \"Ghostbusters\" is that it looks like a money-grab. I understand that I've only seen a trailer, but even that had the appearance of being an extended \"Saturday Night Live\" sketch. The \"humor\" consisted of either awkwardness or shouting, the characters seemed like done-to-death tropes, and everything that made the original film great looked like it had been replaced with quotable one-liners. None of this would have been improved by replacing the female cast with a male one, which makes the accusations of sexism that much more absurd.\n\nThe movie just looks *bad*.\n\n**TL;DR: People who complain about the new \"Ghostbusters\" are often accused of sexism, but sexism isn't the problem.**", "created_utc": 1461966771.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1461984204.0, "id": "d2mmkce", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_4h1a1h", "parent_id": "t3_4h1a1h", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/4h1a1h/ghostbusters_remake_is_the_most_disliked_trailer/d2mmkce/", "score": 1291, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "RamsesThePigeon", "author_id": "59k8h", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Why I'm told I hate it:\n \n- Misogyny\n- Misogyny\n- Misogyny\n- Has to be misogyny since it can't be a shitty movie, it has women\n \nWhy I actually hate it:\n \n- Shitting casting\n- Shitting script\n- Shitting acting\n- Shitty costumes\n- Shitty props\n- Shitty special effects\n- Shitty characters\n- Shitty humor\n- Redoing the original movie, only worse\n- Not the Ghostbusters we've been teased with as a possibility for years\n- Having \"it has women so you must love it or you're a misogynist\" shoved in my face", "created_utc": 1461981165.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d2mvcqa", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_4h1a1h", "parent_id": "t3_4h1a1h", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/4h1a1h/ghostbusters_remake_is_the_most_disliked_trailer/d2mvcqa/", "score": 49, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "LKDlk", "author_id": "jmgj6", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "This post has more likes than the trailer", "created_utc": 1461987780.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d2mz82t", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_4h1a1h", "parent_id": "t3_4h1a1h", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/4h1a1h/ghostbusters_remake_is_the_most_disliked_trailer/d2mz82t/", "score": 9, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "We should vote with our wallets.

Just because I dislike something with women in it does not mean I hate women, I hate the product being sold.\n\nThe reason I hate this film is because its shit that nobody asked for. For nearly 30 years everyone has been dying for another Ghostbusters film. The Hollywood comes around and say \"Hey guess what? Where gonna make another Ghostbusters, but we're going to change the entire cast, the characters and (from what I've seen in the trailer) rehash a bunch of the old jokes with shitty delivery and needlessly tacked on extra lines!\"\n\nThere reason no one want female Ghostbusters isn't because of the big bad \"patriarchy\" it's because we want more of the old Ghostbusters. The main cast is one of the biggest things that made that movie work, no you've changed pretty much everything about the film and have the audacity to try and pass it off as what we wanted.\n\nThen factor in on top of everything that the film is parading around under the guise of being empower for women. No its not. Taking a classic and replacing everyone with women isn't progressive, first of all its lazy, you couldn't even come up with an original idea, you just rehashed something classic to cash in on it's popularity. Also creating a movie or even just a character for the sole purpose of \"empowerment\" isn't empowering at all. Creating detailed strong roles and plots for female characters is great, creating something sole so you can cast females in it is almost as bad as as cast women just to look good.

Max Landis hasn't helped this angle any with the way he attempted to defend American Ultra last year, proclaiming that there aren't original movies being made. That studios won't take risks on original ideas.\n\nThis is only really true in that Hollywood isn't big on original productions with the budgets like The Avengers or even this Ghostbusters remake. And the reason for that is because these movies require a notable ROI for studios to take that risk. A $30 million misfire like American Ultra is a lot easier to overlook for when the studio has a big summer tent pole film that will kill at the box office and potentially on merchandise sales. But a $300 million bomb is a whole other matter.\n\nThe original Ghostbusters from 1984 brought in nearly $300 million worldwide ($250 million of that was domestic) on a $30 million budget. Adjusted for inflation, the production would come to about $70 million. The worldwide gross would come to about $700 million.\n\nThe remake/reboot coming out this year is said to cost around $150 million, costing nearly twice as much as the inflation-adjusted cost of the original. Add in the increased cost to market this movie on a global scale across various outlets these days, and one can only imagine how much this movie needs to make in its first few weeks to break even. Huge risk, but with a brand like Ghostbusters it stands a chance of being profitable enough, especially after the merchandise sales (that obviously will capitalize on new fans of this movie and the nostalgia for the original--who else is buying Ecto Cooler?).\n\nBut some unknown movie with a budget of $150 million featuring a group of women that aren't exactly known for carrying this sort of big budget feature? Two of whom are SNL-level talent? That would be an insane risk that more than likely would not pay off. But a smaller scale film with a reasonable budget? That shit happens all the time to great success. Support those movies, the talent in them, in great numbers and they can get the chance to make bigger movies. Originality is risky and costly, and movie-goers demanding bigger original films have to stop talking about it and actually pay up. Verbal support is simply not enough.

There's no reason for it so it just seems like an insult to fans of the original. And when you've got a beloved property like Ghostbusters you want to see the mythology incorporated and built upon, you want the humor to stand up to the original, and it's also nice to have at least one or two actors to tie down in a passing the torch role. I think that is why Force Awakens worked so well. Regardless of how you feel about the story it is apparent that they had the upmost respect for the source material. Hell, even Jurassic World did a good job in that respect. \n\nIf it was apparent they had treated Ghostbusters with that same level of respect I think people would be looking forward to it.
