Do not make DB connections from your landing page. Make your landing page static so you're using the least amount of resources possible. A reddit hug-of-death can easily be prevented.\n\n2. If you must show some dynamic content then read it from a cache rather than fetching it directly from the DB. Fetching from DB for each request is how you max out on available DB connections. You can also fetch dynamic content from the DB once every hour and keep it in a shared memory space that can be accessed by all requests hitting your application.\n\n3. You should also rate throttle the incoming requests to keep your server running under load. Also, you can timeout requests that are waiting to be served that have waited too long and redirect them to a nice message that says, 'We're under heavy load at the moment, please try again later'. Ideally, you should never have to show that message to users if you can scale your application elastically.\n\nGood luck!", "created_utc": 1507063042.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dnv4gqv", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_740tkq", "parent_id": "t3_740tkq", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/740tkq/i_quit_my_day_job_to_make_what_i_genuinely_think/dnv4gqv/", "score": 94, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "dpnchl", "author_id": "14enyr", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I hear Moon is pretty good.

I highly recommend that you have picture samples for every single one of your movies. It could be a poster, or a random still from the movie, but a picture. Letterboxd does that, IMDb has lots of pictures too, every user who makes popular imgur recommendation albums in here does too as well - pictures are worth a thousand words and are often the main selling point of a movie.\n\nMaking the trailer picture sample bigger would be a good start I guess, as it's often a random still from the movie. But still, I think having the poster in there would help immensely.\n\nThose are my suggestions!", "created_utc": 1507046535.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dnuoibq", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_740tkq", "parent_id": "t1_dnulg2z", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/740tkq/i_quit_my_day_job_to_make_what_i_genuinely_think/dnuoibq/", "score": 859, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Daxtreme", "author_id": "dtz2j", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Yeah, I gotta agree with him on #2. \n\nI really liked the design and layout, looks slick.

I definitely think you have a point there, and that there's far more 'beauty' and 'worthwhileness' in Cayden's life than is usually recognized, for the sole reason that he's unable to perceive either of those elements and only sees the negativity in it. \n\nHis romance with Hazel contains more 'Real' moments than many people get to experience in a lifetime, all he can think about is himself, so he repeatedly loses her to other men who actually give a shit about her. His daughter is fucking adorable but he, again, cares only about himself, can't explain things in terms that don't upset her (\"Daddy, I don't want blood!\"), and ultimately loses her too. He wins global recognition and funds via the Macarthur Grant, and commands an ensemble of hundreds of devoted actors and support staff, but, again, perceives the entire endeavour as a failure because he fails to recognize the crucial fact that **it's about the journey, not the destination** -- and perhaps this is most true when it comes to the creation of art. \n\nHe never performs his play in front of any audience (setting aside the fact that he seemingly doesn't even care about ever doing so, as everyone else is suffering outside in some dystopian reality he ignores wholly), so his life is deemed a failure...when really he's created something incredible and True every day they step onto the set, he's employed and substantiated the lifestyles of countless people who would be out of work and in that hellhole 'outside world' if not for him, and so forth.......but he'd set out on an unattainable goal to basically depict 'all that there is,' 'as it really is,' and in doing so he forgot to enjoy (or even REALIZE) the fact that - exactly as you mentioned - he really did create something True along the way. \n\nAnd finally (to actually address your question, got a bit sidetracked there, can you tell I'm a little obsessed with this film!?), in terms of it being 'enough' for Cayden to be undertaking the act of creating, I completely agree. Think of the alternative; he could be 'just like everybody else,' either an actor/stagehand directed by some batshit crazy delusional boss, or a victim of whatever the hell is going on outside the walls of his set. If he could just wake the fuck up and see it, he'd realize he was literally the luckiest person remaining in that entire world. At the very least, he was oftentimes complacent, and occasionally happy, while he was creating/living, but his consistent internalization solely of the negative events in his life caused him to die alone and with a life wasted, not recognizing what he had had all along.
