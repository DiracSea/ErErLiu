[{"body": "The imdb trivia for this film is the most hilarious read. Some gems include;\n\n- Many of the crew members had to conceal their laughter about what they were witnessing. Even the cameraman began to laugh so hard the camera would shake during takes. The first DP even had his own tent where he would laugh out of sight, while ostensibly watching the footage.\n\n- Although the rooftop scenes were shot with green screen, an actual rooftop was available but never used during filming.\n\n- The reason why Peter seemed dazed and was touching things in one scene was because the actor had suffered a concussion and Tommy Wiseau wouldn't let him leave for treatment.\n\n- Drew Caffrey, who is credited as an executive producer and casting agent, died in 1999, three years before production began.\n\n- According to Tommy Wiseau, Denny has some sort of mental disorder, which explains his behaviour in the film. Philip Haldiman (the actor who portrays Denny) was not told about this.\n\n- Entire scenes were out of focus because nobody bothered to check the lens.\n\n- Post release Tommy Wiseau has claimed that this film was always meant to be a comedy full of so-bad-it's-good elements. The rest of the cast has cast doubt on this theory however.\n\n- According to Juliette Danielle, when Tommy Wiseau said the line \"In a few minutes, bitch,\" everyone on the set began laughing at him. Wiseau came out of the bathroom and demanded to know what was so funny.\n\n- The film's editor tried to convince Tommy Wiseau to cut the shot of his naked buttocks from the movie, on the grounds that the sight of them scared his wife.\n\n- A billboard for the film was erected on Highland Avenue in Los Angeles, where it stayed for five years. Later, the same billboard was used to promote the book The Disaster Artist, written by co-star Greg Sestero about the film's making.\n\n- Shot simultaneously on 35 mm film and high-definition video. Tommy Wiseau was confused about the differences between the formats, so he used both cameras on the same mount. He also purchased the cameras, instead of renting them as film productions usually do.\n\n- According to Greg Sestero, Tommy Wiseau intended for the film to contain a subplot in which Johnny was revealed to be a vampire, due to Wiseau's own fascination with the creatures. Sestero recounts how, at the outset of production, Wiseau tasked members of the crew with figuring out a way to execute a sequence in which Johnny's Mercedes-Benz would lift off from the roof of the townhouse and fly across the San Francisco skyline, revealing Johnny's vampiric nature. Wiseau eventually decided to drop the subplot after learning that there was no practical way to film the flying car scene on the production's budget.\n\n- Unlike most movies, where the sets are generally closed while filming nude sequences, Tommy Wiseau insisted that the set be open while filming the long love scene between Lisa and Johnny.\n\nEDIT: A few more.\n\n\n- Somehow filming lasted 6 months.\n\n- The film was originally written as a play, then a novel. \n\n- When Greg Sestero had to call Dan Janjigian to tell him that they were going to reshoot his scenes, Dan's response upon picking up the phone was \"Did Tommy blow up the studio yet?\"\n\n- Tommy Wiseau once yelled at a crew member for farting on set.\n", "created_utc": 1511577711.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1511584415.0, "id": "dqavxga", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7famwv", "parent_id": "t3_7famwv", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7famwv/tommy_wiseau_submitted_the_room_to_paramount_with/dqavxga/", "score": 7905, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "insane__knight", "author_id": "ds6yo5a", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Well, Paramount lost on this one because this movie is going to keep paying out much longer than a lot of their own productions.", "created_utc": 1511565400.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dqan2ws", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7famwv", "parent_id": "t3_7famwv", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7famwv/tommy_wiseau_submitted_the_room_to_paramount_with/dqan2ws/", "score": 10148, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "SunshineOnline16", "author_id": "12rpy2", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "He also paid to keep it in theatres for the 2 week minimum to qualify for the academy awards.

When we came into the theater down the escalator, he was waiting at the bottom with a table signing stuff. I got him to sign a butt plug I bought to have him sign. He didn't seem phased or question it. We gave him our copy of The Disaster Artist that Greg and Mike signed and he said \"throw this way it's all lies,\" we told him we were sorry and he said, \"I kid, I kid, but burn this\" and signed it. I was first in line for the Q and A and I said that my girlfriend and I built our relationship around the movie, because one of the first things we talked about was the book when we accidentally met online and I sent her my copy to read. I asked if he had advice. He rambled about numbers for a while that didn't make sense, then said \"anyway get married before you die old and alone like me.\" I said we would get married if he officiated. He told her to come up and did a weird gesture and some mumbled \"in the name of the son, the spirit, and the holy ghost\" etc then told us we were married and his assistant who was in The Neighbors gave us merch.\n\nA year or two later, he did an interview and said he was putting his effort into start a dating site for fans because \"he had heard people were meeting because of the movie.\" His assistant added us on Facebook despite us never telling him who we were.", "created_utc": 1511584750.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dqb0lz9", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7famwv", "parent_id": "t3_7famwv", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7famwv/tommy_wiseau_submitted_the_room_to_paramount_with/dqb0lz9/", "score": 923, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "addpulp", "author_id": "h2pig", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "My favorite story in the book The Disaster Artist is about the Golden Gate Park football toss between Mark and Johnny.\n\nApparently the playful tackle was anything but.\n\nThe dialogue during the scene is looped stuff like, \"How's it going man?\" - \"Good, you?\", like a lot of dialogue mixing in the movie. But what Greg Sestero actually said was 'catch this' in French. He writes in the book that Tommy immediately glared and yelled,\"NO FRENCH WORDS IN MY MOVIE, DAMN IT!\" and tackled him for real.\n\nI love this story. It's not only hilarious, but retroactively explains why no character in The Room ever says the word *fiancee*.

It is pretty useless unless you write and have trouble with these types of characters, so it is completely skipable, however feedback is welcome if so missed something or got it wrong.*\n\nIt does kinda make sense in a twisted way. If an actor is playing a mental ill person they tend to over act and go for the sterotypical stuff, like swearing for touretts ticks or germaphobia and orderliness for OCD. There have been outliers like DiCaprio, Bale, or Sir Hopkins who gave very good and convincing preformances, however most just feel forced. What made those preformances were the little things that wouldn't make sense if you weren't aware of the character's disability. \n\nTo have someone not know or understand their characters disorder is the best way to simulate an actual disorder. When someone with a disorder does something, they usually aren't a willing participant in it but just along for the ride. These acts are called compulsions, and sometimes people will feel overwhelming compulsions and act on them, no matter how benign or silly the act is. This could be something as pointless as touching something a certain amount of times (sometimes with no basis for number, sometimes with, depends on the person), all the way to something dangerous like hitting oneself or scratching a certain spot till blood is drawn.\n\nTo the people around the sufferer, and depending on the scope of the disability the sufferer too, these compulsions almost always seem pointless. They can be inconvenient or they can happen with a certain flow that makes you think quirky instead of disabled. If the actor for the character and the actors around the character are unaware of why the character is doing something it will produce more genuine expressions and feelings.\n\nAn important little trait that people often forget when playing a character with OCD are confusion or seeming dazed. When something is running through your head with OCD it takes priority on brain train track one. Everything else is just background noise. Sure you might be able to tune in to the noise and catch bits for a while, but it will all eventually roll back to the roaring thunder of the train. When someone forcefully breaks through that noise and commandeers the tracks for a bit that will usually cause the sufferer to seemingly snap out of a daze or be look extremely lost as to what was happening.\n\nFor things like sociopathy people often attribute it to characters that have a god complex or people that just carry a general disdain for others, which is a critical mistake. The most important part of making a sociopathic character is that they must remain neutral towards others. Yes they can have momentary flare ups of emotion or even feel strongly about a single person or group of people, but on a whole they maintain an indifference and ignore everyone else as they simply don't find them interesting enough to care about. This means that they do not intentionally kill or save people unless it would be of direct benefit to them. This is a hard character to portray as we always have our emotions, so to portray not having those is something that feels inherently unnatural. I feel that the Joker is a perfect example of a sociopathic mindset, he doesn't care about any person not directly related to Batman in some way. To him Batman is the only person worthy of his undivided attention, everyone else are just pawns on the great chessboard he sits at.\n\nPsychopathy and Sociopathy have been lumped into one disorder called ASPD, but for the sake of characters and writing they can be considered different. Psychopaths are going to be the more violent sociopaths, like Bale in American Psycho. These people not only disregard humans but also carry a disdain for them, seeing other people as inferior and disposable.", "created_utc": 1511598809.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dqb7fpj", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7famwv", "parent_id": "t1_dqb1t05", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7famwv/tommy_wiseau_submitted_the_room_to_paramount_with/dqb7fpj/", "score": 21, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "PanamaMoe", "author_id": "gh65l", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "My girlfriend and I were watching The Neighbors and knew that James and Seth were playing Greg and Sandy in the adaptation of Sestero's book, and when Zach Efron freaks out and is super angry we thought \"dude, he should be in Disaster Artist,\" my girlfriend said Chris R and we laughed for a solid five minutes.

It took more than four months to shoot and reportedly cost six million dollars to make, but by the end of the film\u2019s initial run it had earned all of $1,800 in box-office sales and had played in a single Los Angeles-area theater for two weeks. Among its many (many) cinematic sins, multiple plot threads stubbornly refuse to resolve themselves, characters converse like mysterious non-native English speakers, and soft-core sex scenes go on ... and on. Speaking for nearly every review of the film, one commentator quoted in a 2008 [*Entertainment Weekly* article ](http://ew.com/article/2008/12/12/crazy-cult-room/)called it \u201cThe Citizen Kane of bad movies.\u201d\n\n", "created_utc": 1511584340.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1511612845.0, "id": "dqb0col", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7famwv", "parent_id": "t1_dqaykwn", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7famwv/tommy_wiseau_submitted_the_room_to_paramount_with/dqb0col/", "score": 112, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "beast-freak", "author_id": "flxe0", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "This is the same reason troll 2 is so enjoyable as a \u201cbad\u201d movie.

Heck even that sounds like it may not have been entirely legal. The whole thing is pretty sketchy.\n\n\nAnd being a Polish immigrant who had to work under slave like conditions in France and live with a relative in New Orleans definitely does not make it plausible that he just comes from money. \n\n\nTo me the most likely explanation is that some of his money (though certainly not all) came from some kind of shady business practices. There's also speculation that Chloe Lietzke might've been some kind of sugar momma. And then he probably blew away most of his money on The Room and wasn't concerned cuz it was his dream movie and he thought it would be a big hit and earn him a lot of money in return.
