Tennant was great, but because he was just so funny and silly, the writers tended to use that, and even though Tennant could pull off righteous anger amazingly well we simply saw it less. It got even worse with Smith, who continued the trend (and IMO was never as convincing in dramatic / \"angry Doctor\" scenes). Hurt's Doctor was very different, being from a very different time in the Doctor's life. He doesn't do the jolly act to hide the pain, he leaves it on display. He's not a clown with a tragic backstory, he's a soldiern in a tragic present. \n\nWhat I liked about the character is how well he is  built on to Eccleston's Doctor. He has quite.a few character traits (a sense of bitterness, serious demeanor, general orneriness) that were strong in Nine but have been lost or muted over the following years. It was good to see a big star cameo who took the time to care about how his role worked in its world. Moffat's Who is a silly, messy place and it's good to see somebody take it seriously, especially someone who had so many excuses not to.\n\nI haven't seen enough Classic Who to judge how well he stands up there, but of the five revival-era ones, I'd say his only competition is Tennant. And he earned that place in ONE episode.

As you mentioned the Harris had both the aura of grandfather and strong presence of power.

He really seemed like unbalanced old man quick to anger, looking anxious in bad times. A perfect example is the scene where Umbridge fires Trelawney. After she says to him \"for now\" he starts looking around nervously and snaps on the student. Umbridge seems to have an upper hand while he loses his composure.
