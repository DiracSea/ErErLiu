We'll get one of the black actors to play the best friend who dies during the operation. Oh and the villain is trying to build a rocket building factory over the cave so he's trying to sabotage the rescue and make it so the land will be cheaper after they close the cave due to tragedy. He's on a timeline to make a deal too so he's always going to have a cellphone and look angry. We'll call him something like \"Elroy Odorous\" and have him played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. The movie ends with the media condemning him, maybe even have a scene with the cops arresting him for something, I don't know. And can we make sure the last scene has a big flag in it?
