But when Bonnie takes the whole gang on her family's road trip excursion, Woody ends up on an unexpected detour that includes a reunion with his long-lost girlfriend Bo Peep (Annie Potts). After years of being on her own, Bo's adventurous spirit and life on the road belie her delicate porcelain exterior. As Woody and Bo realize they are worlds apart when it comes to life as a toy, they soon come to find that it is the least of their worries.*", "created_utc": 1553001751.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "eivjhir", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_b2wz81", "parent_id": "t3_b2wz81", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/b2wz81/toy_story_4_official_trailer/eivjhir/", "score": 28, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "TooShiftyForYou", "author_id": "p30w3", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Maybe the movie will be better than the preview, but this plot line really feels like they're jumping the shark.

I don\u2019t want to give it away, but this is an incredibly great story. It is so emotional, it\u2019s so funny, it\u2019s so big, the idea they\u2019ve come up with, I\u2019m startled. I couldn\u2019t even get through the last scene. I would love to be a Washington leaker. I just can\u2019t do it. I can\u2019t give any more away. They\u2019ve got great characters, but a couple of scenes toward the end were really hard to get through.\n\nMy theory is short and to the point: \n**Bo Peep is part of a porcelain lamp. She's going to shatter and the Toys are going to scramble to put her back together, but they won't be able to.**\n\nJust the idea of this absolutely tears my heart out and I can imagine Allen getting shaken by it.\n\nWe know the movie is about Buzz and Woody looking for Bo Peep and that it's romance story.\n\n ~~More than likely this is a sequel, but what if it's a prequel, or is built in flashbacks? If any part of this movie takes place *before* Toy Story 3, then the following exchange in TS3 would have even more meaning, should Bo shatter.~~\n\n~~**Woody**: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on now. Wait a minute. Quiet! No one\u2019s getting thrown out, okay? We\u2019re all still here. I mean, yeah, we\u2019ve lost friends along the way.

Even Bo.~~\n\nSo we now know that Bo is entirely in the present, that she won't be shattering in a flashback, but I still think it might happen. As of the new trailer, Bo Peep shows that she has left the life of being a single kids toy. She seems to view life as bigger than that, similar to Lotso and Stinky Pete. \n\nShe may be Woody's long-lost love and found-friend, but she'll end up being the villain when she tries to convince Woody to stay with her.  When the rest of the toys arrive to save Woody and Forky, either Bo will resist and end up damaged, or she'll have a change of heart and end up damaged in the final moments.\n\nIt would be really dark, but I wouldn't put it past Pixar.", "created_utc": 1553008261.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "eivsugg", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_b2wz81", "parent_id": "t3_b2wz81", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/b2wz81/toy_story_4_official_trailer/eivsugg/", "score": 22, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "CivilizedPsycho", "author_id": "j9sfi", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Man, it just looks like a lot that we've seen before - themes that already feel like they've resolved in the previous films.
