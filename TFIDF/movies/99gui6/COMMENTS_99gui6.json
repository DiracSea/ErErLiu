If you watch \"Justice League\" Danny Elfman crafted both his original Batman theme from the '90s and Williams' Superman theme. It's not super subtle but you can definitely hear it if your ears are sharp. The Superman theme doesn't work as well, but he pulls off the Batman call backs for sure.

She's distracting in GoT, as Kit Harrington used to be and to an extent still is and Emilia Clarke have become. Part of it is that as the plot armor unprotected characters have been weeded out and the cliche protagonists have had to lead the show, they've been pushed out of roles that worked for them. Sophie was good at looking like she was a child who had no idea what she was doing because she was a child who had no idea what she was doing. As a political schemer type she's been overwhelmed by other actors in every scene, especially Aiden Gillen.
