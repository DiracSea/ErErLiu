However, Griphook was voiced by Warwick Davis, who plays Professor Flitwick, as well as the first Gringotts goblin. Because the producers wanted a completely British cast, Verne Troyer was replaced by Warwick Davis to portray the role of Griphook in part two of the film adaptations of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.

I have clinical depression and struggle with suicidal thoughts at times. It's REALLY hard to tell someone, because they might 1) take it personally 2) try to get you committed just for admitting you have thoughts even if you don't plan to act on them 3) accuse you of being dramatic or manipulative 4) say \"you're scaring me,\" and implying that it's wrong to talk about your suicidal thoughts.\n\nI once told my dad that I had called a suicide hotline that week. He treated me differently for months. There was no \"how do we get you into therapy\" or any of that, he was almost upset with me for going there. We need to work on getting rid of the stigma associated with talking about suicide. Everyone says to tell someone, but telling someone usually makes things worse.
