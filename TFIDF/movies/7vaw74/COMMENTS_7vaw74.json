Frustrating for knowing I waited a long time to see what I thought was going to be a great movie but also frustrating because the characters were all just so stupid. It's like they did absolutely 0 research about NASA or international space station stuff because none of those crew members were even remotely close. Just so many questions about wtf happened but also why everyone did what they did.\n\n**^Spoilers ^below!**\n\nFirst thing that I wondered was what exactly was the main characters job on the space station? She wasn't a doctor, wasn't an engineer, wasn't a physicist(which wouldn't be on a space station anyways since they deal with information and theory), wasn't a pilot etc... I just couldn't figure out her job.\n\nWhy would you need two keys on a space station to do the thing the space station is designed to do? Why would you need keys at all in the first place? Is the system supposed to be protected from surprise visitors? Why would there be surprise visitors.... Surly they vetted the hell out of all the astronauts before sending them up on the save the world mission. Are the astronauts who are supposed to save the world somehow not trustworthy enough to press the on button on an accelerator?\n\nWhy did the key thing need to come out of a very complex para-scope like device in order to function? Why would you design a simple on switch system to be super complex when knowing the more complex you design a system to be the more chances there are for things to fail? Does Murphy Law not exist in the cloverfield universe?\n\nDo they not know that the sun is a massive ball of energy and that you can actually use it to do stuff and things? Do solar panels, solar stills, mirrors, reflectors, and radioactive materials not exist? How can they create a unlimited power concept but not create solar panels or nuclear power stations?\n\nIf the earth was on the other side of the solar system in which the other space station would have been orbiting, why is it that jensen teleported inside of the space station? Why wouldn't she have been on the other side of the solar system with the other earth?\n\nWhen their earth disappeared why didn't they just check the constellations immediately instead of having to find some gyroscope which turned on some sort of computer system that than did it for them? Do they not know star systems? Did they not have like a map just in case their gyroscope w/e thing broke? If they needed a gyroscope...why didn't they just use the space station itself since it's obviously spinning and stabilizing the space station?\n\nWhy did they instantly trust random wall woman? Why didn't anyone question why all this random shit was going on when wall woman showed up? Why didn't anyone question if she had lots of access to the station itself when she clearly was able to access things like video recordings? Why wouldn't she have been put on guard or strapped down or even just sedated?\n\nHow could they save a woman who teleported into a wall full of pipes and wires and other shit but somehow couldn't save another guy who gets gut shot? Does their cell regeneration stuff not work when they get shot?\n\nWhy would they have a 3d printer that's able to make a gun and bullets? How would they make a 3d printer that can also make working bullets? Does it also make gun powder? Why would someone fill up the gun powder tank on the 3d printer or even engineer a system to have one?\n\nWhy did the space station eat the guy's arm? Why did the guy's arm actually move around? Why did the guy's arm write about where the gyroscope magic thing was? How did the guy's arm know where they were or that someone was around to even communicate with? Like wtf is up with that shit.\n\nHow is it that she had time to say \"i'll explain it later\" but couldn't just say \"we were in another universe\"? Maybe don't send yourself a msg if you're on a time crunch kind of situation. Why would she send herself a msg or the plans to make the station when she knows that they had their own station which only broke because the german guy in their universe sabotaged it? Why not just send the vital data that allowed the thing to work in the first place?\n\nOk that's about it for now.\n\nedit: Another I just remember was why the hell would they put the detach control for a section of the space station on the inside of the section that is to be detached and why would they require the door to be closed in order to detach it. If the detach system is there in case of emergency, wouldn't you want to be able to use it in case an emergency happens?\n\nIf they were having trouble finding power to do the thing with the space station than why didn't they just turn off the motors that were spinning the space station sections? Surely they must be using some sort of power in order to continue spinning it. Why not just shut off all the stuff to every other section of the station except for the parts that are needed to do stuff?\n\nWhy would they go for a space walk but only rely on being tied down with a rope and a latch? Why didn't they have those big ass backpacks that can orient astronauts in space or fly them around? Or like at least magnetic boots that allowed them to walk on the outside of the station. Surely they could have thought of those kinds of things when they created universe moving technology.", "created_utc": 1517810633.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1517811721.0, "id": "dtrbqvv", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7vaw74", "parent_id": "t1_dtrajb5", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7vaw74/cloverfield_paradox_has_been_announced_and_is/dtrbqvv/", "score": 15, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "SC2sam", "author_id": "kiuh2o2", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Hey guess what??
