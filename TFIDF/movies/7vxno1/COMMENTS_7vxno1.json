He has directed, in terms of movies, Zombieland and Gangster Squad. The later of which was not well received. His other directing credits are on TV.\n\nThe screenplay is written by three people.  [Scott Rosbenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Rosenberg) is the first. His credits are iffy. He seems like a capable writer but his experience in COMIC BOOK writing is lacking.\n\nThe second writer is [Kelly Marcel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Marcel).  Her credits are for Saving Mr Banks. This is fine...but not a comic book movie. Her other notworthy credit? Fifty Shades of Grey.\n\nThe last writer credit is for [Jeff Pinkner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Pinkne)]. He seems like a capable writer, having many credits on Fringe. But, lest look at his film and comic book related works. It is not encouraging. He wrote the Amazing spider man 2, which was not well received. His other writing works for movies do not lead me to believe he would be a good choice for Venom.\n\nGiven Sony is the company making this, and that the people behind the scenes seem to lack experience in making a comic book movie...I would be surprised if this movie was any good, but everyone is welcome to hope.\n\n\nNow, to make a comparison, we should look at Wonder Woman. It was PRODUCED by Zack Snyder. Producers are important to production, make no mistake, but I always look at them after the aforementioned roles. \n\nWW was Directed by Patty Jenkins. Her credits were not in the comic book area, and really Monster was her prized work. Still, she seemed more than competent at directing, especially directing strong female actresses. However, the two writers were [Allan Heinberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Heinberg) and [Jason Fuchs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Fuchs). Snyder also had a writing credit on WW. Two of these writers (Snyder and Heinberg) had experience in working with comic books. Heinberg himself had WW credits under his belt following Infinite Crisis.\n\nLastly, the editor for WW was [Martin Walsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Walsh_(film_editor)) His credits aided in making WW a solid movie. Why do I feel this way? Because he edited V for Vendetta. Now, his other credits are great, but I happen to think his style in V showed how good he was at piecing together a comic book movie.\n\nWW looked like it had a CHANCE to be great. The people that were involved COULD make a good movie, and they damn sure did. Venom, on the other hand, I do not feel even has those ingredients to begin with.\n\n\n\nEdited to add links\n\ndouble edit:\nhttps://imgur.com/8zctSAJ\n\n", "created_utc": 1518039124.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1518044303.0, "id": "dtwc3mt", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7vxno1", "parent_id": "t1_dtvvgg3", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7vxno1/venom_poster/dtwc3mt/", "score": 89, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "test_1234567890", "author_id": "g1jtrdx", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Im hoping for whatever course of action is needed to bring venom to the mcu.", "created_utc": 1518032100.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dtw4d9z", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7vxno1", "parent_id": "t1_dtvvgg3", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7vxno1/venom_poster/dtw4d9z/", "score": 53, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "mazimaxi", "author_id": "13j8xo", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I still can't believe this movie being made.", "created_utc": 1518028833.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dtw0q8e", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7vxno1", "parent_id": "t1_dtvvgg3", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7vxno1/venom_poster/dtw0q8e/", "score": 10, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "kejack93", "author_id": "ueoga", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I had read somewhere that this is a passion project of the writer or creator who has tried to get it off the ground for a decade or so, so that gives me some hope.", "created_utc": 1518026200.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dtvxsli", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7vxno1", "parent_id": "t1_dtvvgg3", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7vxno1/venom_poster/dtvxsli/", "score": 22, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Yackemflaber", "author_id": "7xgd3", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "the director isn\u2019t exactly known for quality ", "created_utc": 1518026137.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dtvxq1y", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7vxno1", "parent_id": "t1_dtvvgg3", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7vxno1/venom_poster/dtvxq1y/", "score": 27, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "ScubaSteve1219", "author_id": "5foqu", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "They already kinda fucked it from the start by having venom\u2019s origin separate from spider-man (don\u2019t get me wrong, they don\u2019t by any means have to stick to comic origins, just.. how do you separate a hero from his antithesis?) but maybe they\u2019ll pull through with something great.", "created_utc": 1518032678.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dtw50gv", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7vxno1", "parent_id": "t1_dtvvgg3", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7vxno1/venom_poster/dtw50gv/", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "ltshep", "author_id": "l9dqk", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Solomon Grundy trailer on Monday", "created_utc": 1518040953.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dtwe264", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7vxno1", "parent_id": "t1_dtvygvp", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7vxno1/venom_poster/dtwe264/", "score": 331, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "ray_kats", "author_id": "kl0y2", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Hello WB marketing director ", "created_utc": 1518031049.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dtw3782", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7vxno1", "parent_id": "t1_dtvygvp", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7vxno1/venom_poster/dtw3782/", "score": 196, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "armless_tavern", "author_id": "gh1zd", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Vinnie Chase making his James Cameron debut.
