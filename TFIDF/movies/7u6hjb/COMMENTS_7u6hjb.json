This kicks off a sequence of events that eventually leads to Barry Allen becoming the Flash. \n\nIn Flashpoint BA decides to go back in time and save his mother, in so doing he creates a paradox (The Flashpoint Paradox) and he never becomes the Flash and the world is drastically different. Like Batman is not bothered by killing people, because it's Thomas Wayne not Bruce, because Bruce was the one murdered that night. And Aquaman and WW are baddies and trying to take over the world. Cool right?\n\nNo. Because this means rather than a Flash origin story we get a story where other heroes take notable roles and screentime, and the Flash doesn't even have powers for a major portion. Batman who is more violent loses all of its punch because this universe's Batman already fucking brands people with a bat symbol and paralyzes them on the reg. \n\nIt's a fundamental lack of understanding by the filmmakers that Flashpoint is really a Justice League story with the Flash being a major character and catalyst, it's NOT a standalone Flash story.\n\nSo, they either focus on the Flash almost entirely leaving out the Wayne/Aquaman/Wonder Woman parts basically cutting out *everything* that was cool about the Flashpoint story in the first place (a la CW). OR They have all that stuff and make a really cool *Justice League* movie at the expense of the Flash getting a standalone film (way less likely than just butchering the story to make it fully Flash centric). Additionally, the likelihood of any standalone in the universe (let alone the FIRST movie for the character) getting the budget to justify all of the characters needed is unlikely to say the least.\n\nTherefore, Flash fans will inevitably be disappointed. Either they lose the standalone featuring their favorite character that they were excited for and get another JL movie, or they get a butchered version of the Flashpoint story meaning they will never get to see one of the most iconic Flash catalyst events occurring on the big screen in this DCEU. \n\nThere is just no winning. Bad choice of a first story and shows the fundamental lack of care going into the entire franchise. The only good thing that could come out of Flashpoint is an entire DCEU reboot which is also probably never going to happen.\n\nTL;DR: Flashpoint is an iconic *Justice League* story and when they try and cram it into a standalone they will inevitably leave out all of the good bits or end up ignoring the Flash which is doing him dirty in the first Flash-centric movie we're supposed to get.", "created_utc": 1517460879.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dtk3sio", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7u6hjb", "parent_id": "t1_dtispps", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7u6hjb/antman_and_the_wasp_teaser_poster/dtk3sio/", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "KushTravis", "author_id": "avinm", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I never knew squirrel girl had friends", "created_utc": 1517380558.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dtib37b", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7u6hjb", "parent_id": "t1_dtib267", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7u6hjb/antman_and_the_wasp_teaser_poster/dtib37b/", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "AliBurney", "author_id": "tt877", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "The best mistake is combining the two in only the second movie of the DCEU franchise.
