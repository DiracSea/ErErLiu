Frozen broke a lot of Disney tropes which was pretty awesome. (Here are a few) \n   1. The heroine isn't just a \"Rawr girl power I'm tough!\" charicature.  There are actually two, and they're sisters, and one of them is just a powerless sheltered girl.\n   2. The \"love at first sight\" was thoroughly rejected when it turns out that Prince Charming is actually a megalomanic attempted-murderer.\n   3. \"True loves first kiss\" was also rejected.  What saved frozen Anna was not her recently-met-not-even-boyfriend-yet's kiss, but her Sisters love.\n   4. There is a genuine male lead (Kristoff) that isn't trying to get up in someones pants, and is just being a good person.\n   5. Reindeers are in fact better than people.\n   6. The thing that stuck out to me the most about these broken tropes, was that it was for once a Disney movie where they were discouraging jumping into romantic relationships with the first 'Dashing Hero' that \"saved your day\" - and instead learn the importance of family and being mindful about your own situational biases (\"Oh look I'm going to marry this guy I just met after having been locked alone in a castle for the last decade!\" THINK AGAIN!)\n4.
