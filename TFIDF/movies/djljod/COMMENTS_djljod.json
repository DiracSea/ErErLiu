That was always Gene's story, so I still don't know where this 'Bruce was smacking around stuntmen' stuff is coming from, but certainly not Gene LeBell.\n\nEDIT: never mind, it was some LeBell revisionism. He added it to his story for the OUATIH interviews.\n\nPer Mark Jacobs,\n*Wall told me the two men got into some good-natured back and forth on the set of the Green Hornet TV show where Lee co-starred as Kato and LeBell was working as a stunt man, just as Once Upon a Time in Hollywood depicts. Eventually they decided to do some friendly sparring at which point LeBell grabbed Lee and picked him up pressing him overhead. Wall said Lee was angered by this and threatened to do LeBell real harm when he put him down, to which he said LeBell responded, \u201cThen I guess I\u2019ll have to keep you up there a while.\u201d*\n\nGene's a hell of a judoka, but as someone who's spent decades in the martial arts scene, I can tell you his stories are always pretty contradictory and he has a reputation among practitioners as kind of an embellisher, as evidenced by the fact that he spent years saying it was friendly sparring, and then two months ago changing it to, \"he was smacking around some stuntmen and I had to step in\".\n\nAlso, for example, LeBell tells a story about choking out Steven Seagal where he wet himself. Eventually it was clarified by LeBell that he was kinda bullshitting about the 'wetting himself' part to make the story more interesting.
