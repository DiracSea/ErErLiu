You get the light, carefree, and untethered primary theme from the flutes woodwinds joined by celeste.  Then Williams layers on a secondary theme with soaring strings to show Rey's heart and sense of adventure.  \n\nThe [Kylo Ren music](https://youtu.be/y8ac1Qg-r-8?t=187) is great, too.  It is raw and abrasive.  I really like that Ren doesn't have a full theme yet, only a motif.  It shows how Ren is powerful, but not yet clearly defined.  Compare Kylo's [horn motif](https://youtu.be/y8ac1Qg-r-8?t=259) with Rey's much more developed and focused theme.    \n\n[Scherzo for X-Wings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJzuanMUuS4) is a great toccata.  \n \n[March of the Resistance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueqKtype7Kk) emphasizes the urgency and militancy of the resistance.  John Williams took many sources of inspiration for his music in Star Wars, but several aspects (particularly the space battles) are reminiscent of William Walton's score from \"The First of the Few,\" a British movie from 1942 about the Royal Air Force in the early days of WWII.

I think our predisposed expectations for star wars to recapture the feel of star wars were so high that they were unreasonable going into this movie, especially after the prequels. At this point that many of us weren't able to let go and just let the music stand in it's own. When I finally learned to just let go and appreciate it for what it is, it's totally star wars and it's also totally memorable. Williams continues to grow as a musician, he evolves and so does his music. \n\ntldr; I started out despising TFA soundtrack. I learned to love it. It's glorious as any star wars soundtrack to me now. Scavenger, Rey's theme, Jedi steps all hold their own to me. I suppose march of the resistance as well. Of course lots of people are in here saying \"doesn't compare with DOTF\" but to me the memorable theme from the prequels was Across the Stars. I think as the other movies are tied together and we get to see reys theme used more and a broader context developed for the themes williams has created for TFA, these themes will flesh out more in our minds as we'll have more associations to remember them by.

Guys like Ennio and Hans are good composers with a couple of truly great scores (I believe The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly to be possibly the best score ever), but Williams has crushed it in every measurable way.

He started his early days by composing for Gilligan's Island in the mid-60s. He had a busy decade, and rose to prominence in the 70s. By the end of the 80s he was alone at the top, and he's kind of stayed there for 25 years. I don't think it's close.\n\n_p.s.

Good melody is memorable and sticks, whether it's early Beatles songs or the Jurassic Park theme. If it gets stuck in your head, if you can whistle it after hearing it once - it's catchy and that works. This has been the bread and butter of John William's musical career, from Giligan's Island to Superman to Star Wars to Indiana Jones to Jurassic Park to Harry Potter. This is precisely what is missing from the Force Awakens soundtrack.\n\nListen to Rey's theme. It doesn't have a strong melody, not like Williams' major themes. It's layered, something Williams likes to do, but it doesn't use that to contrast when it clears out space for a catchy riff (Across the Stars for example does this really well). If you asked a hundred people to whistle or hum the Star Wars theme, they'd all hit the same parts in the same way. Ditto all of these other tracks I've mentioned... Except Rey's Theme. It's largely forgettable music that due to orchestration it sounds like textbook Williams. \n\nIn my opinion, I still don't believe that John Williams wrote the music for this movie. The orchestration is textbook JW and Star Wars, but thematically and melodically the score is immensely different. He might be at that age where he's off-loading more of the grunt-work (of which there is a surprising amount in composition). But it's not normal for him.
