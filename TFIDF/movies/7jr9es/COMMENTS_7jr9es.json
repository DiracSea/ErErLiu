It was one of the bigger fishes with still profitable assets and aspirations in film AND television. Even its independent wing, Searchlight, has been operating at a high level after a down 2016 - just look at the Golden Globe noms this year.\n\nNow, this big fish has been enveloped by the whale that is Disney. What happens when Disney gets hungry again and suddenly sees the franchise potential in a smaller fish (currently weaker asset) such as Paramount or Columbia Pictures (it's only Sony so long as Sony maintains their ownership)? Those are easier deals to make for the wigs of those companies and, considering the likely windfall of Disney's upcoming streaming service and merchandising, for Disney to offer whatever those owners want.\n\nPeople are saying this is a monopoly - it isn't... Not yet. But, it is a horizontal merger (business consolidation that occurs between firms that operate in the same space) that could lead down the road of there being one. Fox wasn't some entity being rescued from solvency by Disney; this wasn't a wounded animal being taken down. This is one of the top studios being enveloped by the biggest studio.\n\nThere are mitigating factors that prompted the Murdochs to sell -- in fighting with the shareholders, arrests of certain princes and a fear of being unable to compete in the digital domain with the likes of Disney and Netflix decades from now... They're selling the company at its peak valuation or at least before it could take a hit.\n\nPeople will say, \"well, Comcast was the other suitor so lesser of two evils, right?\" Is this November 2016 again? Neither suitor was suitable or would have been good for the industry - either way would have two major studios folding in on one another (Disney or Universal and Fox) in a horizontal merger. \n\nThis isn't to say Fox needs to stay under 21st Century control, but there are other players that could have been tapped with the Murdochs wanting to sell - Apple, Google, even Amazon could have been suitors as they look to expand their businesses into a realm that they have been trying to establish some standing in. This would have been more of a vertical merger that would ultimately keep Fox around in the same capacity as Sony owning Columbia or Gulf Western owning Paramount back in the day.\n\nContent-wise, aside from Bob Iger dictating about a third of what enters theaters and your televisions, consider what this means for the other studios - how do you compete with Disney? You fucking reboot reboot reboot... Everything is going to be created with the intent to franchise so buh-bye to the last semblance of adult-oriented content from the majors, you're being pushed aside for a sorry attempt at reinvigorating this or that old ass property.\n\nThe only hope are the A24 and Neons of the world, but there will always be a cap on their ability to load content into theaters at least in a wide capacity. This is especially true when you have Disney swinging its dick to make deals with the chains, like showing Star Wars in your biggest theater for a month and not a day less, or not showing it at all.\n\nThe last thing, and this should be a bit scary for those of you on this sub who were thinking of getting a job in the studio system, this will cut out one of the major employers in Hollywood. Not everyone at Fox is getting laid off, but there is going to be a human toll - there will be redundancies and experts/analysts have already said that Disney will look to trim $2.5 billion from these \"synergies\" once they swallow up Fox... That's a lot of people... Again, that's a human toll and those are jobs that will never come back.\n\nSo, enjoy your X-Men and Fantastic Four fighting in \"Avengers 6: The Quest for More Money,\" but I hope it doesn't blind you to how this is a seismic moment in the industry... At some point, and I know it seems like it will never happen, but there will be a lull in the comic book craze and I hope this will all still be worth it.\n\n- Chicken Little (you can probably guess who I may or may not work for)", "created_utc": 1513262812.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1513264650.0, "id": "dr8o2a3", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7jr9es", "parent_id": "t3_7jr9es", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7jr9es/disney_to_buy_21st_century_fox_assets_for_524/dr8o2a3/", "score": 351, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "mattedward", "author_id": "c8nyc", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "The mcu will actually outlive me at this point im certain and im only 21.", "created_utc": 1513260793.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dr8menl", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7jr9es", "parent_id": "t3_7jr9es", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7jr9es/disney_to_buy_21st_century_fox_assets_for_524/dr8menl/", "score": 56, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "pkkthetigerr", "author_id": "nnbcs", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Here we go...
