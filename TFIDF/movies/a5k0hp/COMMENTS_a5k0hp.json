Her room was filled with small drawings, carvings, and models of Sully and Mike, as well as other peoples of the monster world, including the marvelous technology she had glimpsed but had been far too young to understand.  People thought she was a little off, but her brilliant mind gave her a lot of leeway.  \n\nGraduating from college with her masters of science at 23, the brilliant Boo, aka Lucy, began to spend a lot of time with her studies.  Quickly tiring of the rigamarole of established scientific method, she left the research facility and moved to the small town of Anderson and became a teacher at the middle school there.\n\nIt was there that she met and fell in love with an equally quirky man, Bud Robinson.  Though happily married, it turns out that somehow all the travels to and from the Monster World had somehow affected her and she was unable to have children.  Shortly after this though, she adopted a young orphan named Lewis who demonstrated a fantastic invention at the science fair: a memory viewer.   As Lewis grew, many times she would sit down and allow the memory viewer replay those happy memories of her visits with Mike and Sully.  \n\nLewis saw how happy these trips down memory lane made his mother, and thus as he grew he worked on his secret, greatest project - a time machine.  Along the way, he developed hundreds of brilliant inventions, so much so that the nearby town changed its name to Todayland to show that tomorrow had indeed arrived.  \n\nAt last the day had come and he completed his prototype time machine.  Keeping it a secret from his mother, he, as always, immediately began to work on an improved model.  The original model had an odd restriction - it would only travel within a time frame that he himself was present in.  While miraculous, this would not help his mother.  After months of work, he completed his masterpiece, building a machine that would truly allow for a trip through time, unrestricted.  \n\nBefore he had a chance to show his mother the device, he was called away on an urgent trip in relation to another of his inventions.  While he was away, his son Wilbur accidentally allowed the time machine to be stolen.  Knowing that the invention was important to his father, he brought his father's younger self to the future to build a replacement, not realizing he didn't have the ability to do so yet.  While Lewis' younger self was in the future, he worked on the time machine and due to his uncertain knowledge of the machine, he accidentally 'fixed it' in an unconventional way - the machine now could travel not just in time but also in alternate dimensions.  This became briefly apparent when the younger Lewis went to an alternate future where he did not exist.  Returning home, the elder Lewis, now calling himself Cornelius, sent his younger self home after the timeline was reset.  He was then able to show his mother the time machine, not recalling (or perhaps unaware, due to the new multi-dimensional nature of the machine) its new powers.  He set the dials on the machine, sat his mother in the chair, and sent her off to her past to revisit Sully and Mike.\n\nUnfortunately, the multi-dimensional nature of the machine manifested itself and took Lucy to a completely different timeline.  Brilliant as she was, she could not find a way home.  Eventually, she settled into a place she found relaxing - a small forest cottage she built herself far outside of Inverness, at some time in the middle ages.   For some reason, she found the lack of technology relaxing - the few tools that she was able to build from the remnants of the time machine allowed her to live a comfortable life, even if some of the people in town felt it meant she practiced magic.  It was there, as she passed the hours whittling away that a tall young prince came one day to ask a favor...", "created_utc": 1544656565.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1544656885.0, "id": "ebnwh3p", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_a5k0hp", "parent_id": "t1_ebnbi3n", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/a5k0hp/the_next_original_feature_from_pixar_animation/ebnwh3p/", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Evadrepus", "author_id": "jx7pz", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "That's my favourite Pixar film because from start to finish it's just an elegant and simple story.
