He's pretty cynical about everything and everyone, not so much looking for a change as smugly pointing out that everyone is stupid.\n\nOffice Space on the other-hand is a complete rejection of office culture, it portrays the workers as stuck in a dystopian corporate trap and more generally portrays modern feelings of social alienation pretty sympathetically. There is not a trace of smugness, the main characters don't hate anyone or really express feelings of being better than the management, rather they are either angry at the situation or apathetic towards the bosses. Peter is a good example of this, like in the scene where he talks plainly to his bosses. Peter doesn't care at all how the company is run, he only is bothered that it is so shitty for those who work there.\n\n Basically one is class warfare, and the other is anodyne corporate humor that ultimately serves the purposes of the corporations themselves. There is nothing in Dilbert that is controversial enough that it will ever be frowned upon in corporations themselves, that is why you always see strips hung up in cubicles and things. Office Space does not promote the sort of attitudes that corporations are ok with on the other hand.\n\nThe only thing they have in common is the setting.", "created_utc": 1554502367.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "ek7jvmc", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_b9stqo", "parent_id": "t1_ek6ybrl", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/b9stqo/twenty_years_ago_an_upstart_animator_named_mike/ek7jvmc/", "score": 11, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Yeah but nobody had done a TV show or movie like it though, even the Dilbert cartoon was a flop iirc", "created_utc": 1554488217.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "ek6z95y", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_b9stqo", "parent_id": "t1_ek6ybrl", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/b9stqo/twenty_years_ago_an_upstart_animator_named_mike/ek6z95y/", "score": 47, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "bosco9", "author_id": "4folf", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Early Dilbert was good.

The Matrix, Fight Club, Van Wilder and Office Space all had a common theme of \"you're not special, and the lie of believing you are special to motivate you is a burden on your ability to feel happiness, free yourself from the need to believe you are unique. The absurdist enlightenment of all the movies drives the characters to question what they need to be motivated to go on with their life, to escape their own purgatory of self loathing. \n\nExcept for Old School, in Van Wilder, like Fight Club and Office Space all touch on a character experiencing faux enlightenment before realizing their errors of their warped worldview. If any movie is the odd one out, it's Old School for not having the character arc where they snap out of it, yet triumph.  American Psycho it consumes him and he never triumphs over it, but the audience can experience the arc, even if only as an observer, not through the avatar of the main characters own internal revelation (albeit the confession narration not withstanding.) Old School leads you to believe in the initial enlightenment. In The Matrix, Neo triumphs over the shackles and empty promises of the prophecy to pave his own path, just like the Narrator defeating Tyler.\n\nYou're not special by birth or destiny, it's your courage, actions, and choices that define you as a hero.  Or finding happiness in being a construction worker or college graduate on your own terms.\n\nOffice Space, Van Wilder, and Fight Club are the movies where their character outgrows their rebellion to find peace in being part of the system, they triumph over rebellion.  In all three they basically destroy the institution before realizing they didn't need to tear it down, that they could make the world a better place from within society.   Their original rebirth and escapism \n transformed into a Faustain bargain they didn't actually want. The Matrix and Old School their rebellion triumphs over the system. American Psycho is a tragedy where society fails him, and he loses touch from reality, and never regrasps functioning adulthood. Come to think of it, Shutter Island fits in some of these elements too. \n\nThe Matrix and Fight Club also have the best soundtracks for conveying angst, rage and defiance.\n\nEdit: and as I finish typing this I realize I forgot American Beauty, Arlington Road, The Big Kahuna, Eyes Wide Shut, Magnolia, The Sixth Sense, and The Truman Show. And lest we not forget these movies were all before Y2k and 9/11, the stability, security, and safety of the world were seen as rote, trite, boring. Shaking up the system was all the rage until somebody tried it and we were the institution attacked.
