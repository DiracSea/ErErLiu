I! The scene is the initiation of Ivan's personal guard/assassin force/goth twink harem (called *oprichniki*). The young man in the picture is the \"first called\" *oprichnik* who was widely rumored to be Ivan's lover. He's being murdered \\*symbolically\\* to prove his devotion to ~~daddy~~ the Great Russian State. (He would later be literally murdered in part III, but only by one knife held by ~~Nazi homophobe~~ German spy Heinrich Staden.) Note Stanislavsky-trained romantic lead actor Mikhail Kuznetsov's masterful execution of a fanatical gaze equal parts thirst and terror, angelic innocence being transmuted into demonic ambition and bloodlust. The sheet music for Prokofiev's music for this scene survives (the oath is sung) and has been recorded -- it's exquisitely, flamboyantly creepy: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bU1Kn02Iy0&list=OLAK5uy\\_ktW83vO3Ub0Gh0ms8xbiq3LeCX7S2mqoc&index=37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bU1Kn02Iy0&list=OLAK5uy_ktW83vO3Ub0Gh0ms8xbiq3LeCX7S2mqoc&index=37)\n\nEisenstein was explicit about Ivan and Fedor's romantic and sexual relationship in his notes for the film and though he had to tone it down in execution, the homoerotic subtext is extremely there (enough to be a major motivation for the banning of part II). The initiation scene was cut from film for being (and this is very nearly a direct quote from a state official) \"too satanic.\" An excellent, carefully researched scholarly account of the conflict between Eisenstein and the censors can be found in Joan Neuberger's *This Thing of Darkness: Eisenstein's Ivan the Terrible in Stalin's Russia* (a great book overall, probably the best long-form work on the film to date!)\n\nsorry if someone already made this correction, i have never used reddit and just read through what showed up when i loaded this page. bonus content for those of you who read this far: when Kuznetsov (as I said, a Stanislavskyian \"method\" actor) asked Eisenstein (the anti-Stanislavsky) what to do to prepare for the role, the director told him to go to the zoo and observe large cats.
