Sarah has lived an entirely different life, and John has been raised from birth to be a machine killing machine - having survived the nuclear holocaust he emerges more ready to fight Skynet than he ever was, and that's why Skynet is now so desperate to keep sending back Terminators further and further in order to ensure it's own survival.\n\nSure, Genysis gets a little preachy in places, but its a great movie in my opinion which had some great callbacks to T1 and T2, whilst officially removing Salvation from the timeline _and_ better explaining why Salvation was a thing than Salvation itself did.\n\nEDIT: /u/soFATZfilm9000 has correctly pointed out that the events of T2 could not have amended the date of judgement day, but is instead an integral event to ensure it happened at all.", "created_utc": 1572769788.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1572772927.0, "id": "f6b7vvg", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_dqvt6w", "parent_id": "t1_f6axavo", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/dqvt6w/i_kinda_want_to_see_a_reverse_terminator_movie/f6b7vvg/", "score": 28, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "coffeeismyestus", "author_id": "u52mp", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Small changes in the ways that Skynet came to be, but ultimately it's gonna happen one way or another.

I\u2019d give credit, but the user has apparently deleted their account.\n\n>Sequels to T2 don't make canonical sense either. The T-800 sent back in time to kill Sarah Connor was done as a last ditch effort once Skynet was defeated. We find out in T2 that the T-1000 was sent back to finish the job that the T-800 couldn't complete. Now does this break canon? No. The future is based on the first film always having occurred as it did, that's why we see Kyle Reese with the picture of Sarah Connor that is taken at the end of the film. The future that Kyle is from is a bit of a loop, but that's too complicated of a subject to talk about right now.\nAnyway T2 doesn't break canon because you can easily say that the T-1000 was the last remaining Skynet Terminator to be active, based on a August 29, 1997 Judgement Day. It was a prototype after all, not the final product. Because of that we can conclude that the T-1000 is Skynet's last ditch effort. Had it had enough time, the T-1000 would have replaced the T-800 and killed off the Resistance with ease. That being said, the T-1000 most likely went into hiding after Skynet's defeat. It likely had more than two missions besides killing Sarah and John Connor. Knowing that Skynet would be defeated in the current timeline, it would stay put and help further develop Skynet to become far more advanced than it would be in the timeline the T-1000 is from. Thus helping win the war. So the T-1000 infiltrates the time machine facility and goes back to kill John and Sarah. Why 1995 instead of back to 1985? This is probably because going farther back could create a butterfly effect that would jeopardize Skynet's creation. So just show up 2 years early where you'll have plenty of time to kill the Connors and help develop/protect Skynet at Cyberdyne. Had the T-1000 succeeded in killing the Connors given that Sarah killed Miles Dyson, it would have probably even taken his place at Cyberdyne.\nAnyway here's a bit of irony that Skynet did. The first movie in a way establishes that both the Resistance and Skynet are \"children\" of the future. They both more or less began their existence at the same time. So Skynet trying to kill Sarah/John Connor actually creates itself along with John Connor.  If Skynet didn't sent the T-800 back in time then John Connor nor Skynet would exist. But at the same time by trying to kill John Connor, it ends up killing itself. You see if the T-1000 was never sent back in time, then there would have never been a reason to send the T-800 back in time to protect John. Skynet basically killed itself in more than one way (since it also created the T-800 that killed the T-1000.) Anyway so why does sequels to T3 break canon? Because they make no freakin sense. Judgement Day is somehow delayed to 2004 and Skynet actually ends up exactly like it did in a 1997 creation. At the same time it's stupid that by delaying Judgement Day would mean that not only does the Resistance not kill Skynet, but John Connor dies as a result. I'll forgive Salvation because they tried more or less to tie in with the established canon that the first two films made. But Genisys fucks up everything EVEN MORE that I really don't want to go into a long rant about. But long story short, the only way Genisys actually happens is by a missing film taking place. That's right, there's a missing Terminator film that's supposed to take place in between Salvation and Genysis. Now surely you'd think that it's just John training Kyle and leading up to the events of the beginning of the film. Which should of course happen. However Genisys establishes that Judgement Day occurs in 1997, and John saved Kyle from a T-600 in the sewers. That means that in order for the events of Genisys to have happened that the timeline of Salvation needed to have some other shit to have happened. More time traveling Terminators or something that would mean that T3 didn't happen, but it still changed up the future enough that John doesn't rescue Kyle from a Skynet labor camp and instead from a T-600 in the sewers. And I think I have an answer to this and it's in Genysis.\nWe know that at some point Skynet sends the T-1000 (presumably the same individual from T2) to kill Sarah, and the Resistance sends a reprogrammed T-800 to protect her. That is the result of a timeline based on the first 4 films. If you really think about it, the future of T3 doesn't have Kyle Reese, two T-800s or a T-1000 sent back in time because of how fucked shit becomes for the timeline.\nSo based on that, we know that because of a later Judgement Day = sooner T-700/800 models being released, we can conclude that the attack on Skynet actually occurs early. The mission is a success, however Skynet sends the T-1000 to kill Sarah. A T-800 is reprogrammed and sent back to protect Sarah. So as time goes on, this new timeline produces a future where Skynet is created in 1997. However there's a problem with this. A 97 JDay means that the first film would need to have occurred in that new timeline exactly as it did in order to produce the future seen in Genisys. Except that's impossible based on the T-1000 and T-800 already having messed up the timeline with them being in the 60's/70's. So SOMEHOW the future they produce leads up to the opening of Genysis. Which this explains why John finds Kyle in the sewers, and that the T-3000 exists and turns John into a terminator. Somehow in this timeline Kyle bangs Sarah with a 1997 Judgement Day occurring. Though Kyle shouldn't die in this situation because \"Pops\" is there. idk it's so fucked and confusing. TL;DR\n>You might as well consider everything after T2 just fan fiction because of how fucked it makes everything, except maybe Salvation since it more or less tries to fit in with the canon established in the first two films. If you're interested, there actually is technically another Terminator film called Terminator 2 3-D: Battle Across Time. It was a show at Universal Studios up until a few years ago. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Edward Furlong, Linda Hamilton, and Robert Patrick all reprise their roles.

James Cameron is one of the best working directors around, both in terms of commercial success and functional storytelling (a la Spielberg). Unless you count Piranha 2--he doesn't--then his first movie is THE TERMINATOR. Then what? Oh just a little movie called ALIENS. He makes T2. He makes flipping TITANIC. And then AVATAR. Even his worst movies, The Abyss and True Lies, ate respectable, successful films; they're only lesser for him because they don't literally reinvent the genre. Dude is a machine that churns out incredibly shot, functional movies with clear stakes and clear action sequences where you can always tell what's going on. And beyond that, he's a force for advancing technology and filmmaking craft in Hollywood. Both original Terminator films were huge special effects leaps. Avatar more or less created the 3D boom. He made huge advances in underwater photography and filming throughout his career.\nSo get out of here with this Reddit circlejerk that Cameron's somehow not good. He's literally responsible for the ONLY good Terminator things you have, seeing as how he wrote and directed the first two movies and then had zero involvement with any film besides Dark Fate (which he produced but didn't direct--and look at that! It's the third-best one in the series by a decent margin.) Sure, his ideas sound weird and not imo the most \"exciting\" right now, but we thought he was washed up before both Avatar and Titanic--the two top grossing films of all time--too.\nIn the words of David Sims, \"If James Cameron thinks I need four more Avatar films, then maybe I do need four more Avatar films.\"", "created_utc": 1572766689.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "f6b1nop", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_dqvt6w", "parent_id": "t1_f6ah7w8", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/dqvt6w/i_kinda_want_to_see_a_reverse_terminator_movie/f6b1nop/", "score": 164, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "berglt84", "author_id": "m3wj3", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "HIS NAME IS JAMES\n\nJAMES CAMERON", "created_utc": 1572768217.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "f6b4qix", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_dqvt6w", "parent_id": "t1_f6ah7w8", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/dqvt6w/i_kinda_want_to_see_a_reverse_terminator_movie/f6b4qix/", "score": 8, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "TheBlackBear", "author_id": "5d69o", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Umm, James Cameron is fucking brilliant and is responsible for some of the dopest and most influential movies of all time.

It just seemed like a modern day rushed kind of movie without the flow that T2 provides with smaller climax's leading up to a proper ending.  Dark Fate was more of a TV style movie where they rush everything together and throw some flash backs into it which was very different than T1/T2.  The constant theme of Grace getting weak so the group has to stand their ground with a pep speech by this new philosophized leader Dani got old after the first 2 or 3 times it happened... my thoughts are longer than I wanted but I had high hopes for this movie and somewhat feel left down with more questions than answers.  Spoilers below.\n\nEdit: Grace not Clarice.\n\n>!There are some pretty glaring plot holes that appear after the first 30 minutes of watching... you learn that multiple T-800's are sent back in time after T2 takes place that Sarah Conner has been able to destroy.  It begs the question, if Skynet was destroyed in T2 then why are more T-800's being sent back in time to kill John?  Also why T-800 if the T-1000 was far superior?  My guess is Skynet is in an alternate future that will now never happen but continued to send Terminators back as a fail safe to complete their mission even if it was completed.  Still very confusing to learn that the original T-800 from T2 was destroyed for no reason at all and could have served as a protector for John after T2 through Dark Fate.!<\n\n>!Another plot hole was the fact that nothing was prevented in Dark Fate.  In T2 there was multiple things at play, keep John alive, stop Skynet, stop the T-1000, learn more about the T-800 and the future.  Dark Fate was basically a keep Dani alive and stop the Rev-9.  Legion will still come to be since nothing was suggested otherwise much differently than T2 with Miles at Cyberdine and the T-800 being terminated to keep the technology out of the wrong hands.  There is however the possibility that the X-ray taken of Grace as the ICE detention facility and the remaining pieces of the T-800 and Rev-9 will be studied to later create Legion or cause some other adverse impact on the future that the next Terminator movie might explore....!<", "created_utc": 1572792225.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1572809122.0, "id": "f6d8gfh", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_dqvt6w", "parent_id": "t1_f6d0rs4", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/dqvt6w/i_kinda_want_to_see_a_reverse_terminator_movie/f6d8gfh/", "score": 23, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "st4r-lord", "author_id": "jbnov", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "A fucking monkey throwing shit at a wall could have wrote a better sequel.", "created_utc": 1572790982.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "f6d3etr", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_dqvt6w", "parent_id": "t1_f6d0rs4", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/dqvt6w/i_kinda_want_to_see_a_reverse_terminator_movie/f6d3etr/", "score": 18, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "StargazerHandypaws", "author_id": "dwykv", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "After seeing it last Thursday, those are almost my exact same thoughts.
