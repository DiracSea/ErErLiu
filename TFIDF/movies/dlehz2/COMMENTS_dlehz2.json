However, even in his Oscar-bait performances, most of Will Smith's characters feel like a put-on, like he's trying too hard to show everyone how cool/amazing he is. \n\nConversely, John Wayne became the all-time movie icon not because he was the best actor (far from it) but because he *WAS* the gruff yet considerate cowboy that we saw on film. Much like other all-time legends such as Humphrey Bogart, Wayne's performances didn't work out too well when playing ill-fitting characters (such as Bogart in *The Two Mrs. Carrolls* and Wayne in *The Conqueror*) but worked marvelously when picking the right ones. For example, what made Wayne's final film performance in *The Shootist* so amazing was  him using his real life fight with cancer to bleed into the role of a dying gunfighter who spends his last days looking for a way to die with a minimum of pain and a maximum of dignity. \n\nWayne had his own personal code of right and wrong and always played characters who held those same standards, even in his non-western roles like his turn as a former boxer looking to start a new life in romantic drama, *The Quiet Man* (such a great movie). I would argue that his best roles were those where he was a more deeply flawed individual, such as his performances in *The Searchers*, *The Shootist*, and both Rooster Cogburn films. Wayne never had a giant ego and had the self-awareness to know that he wasn't a perfect person. He wasn't afraid to point out his blemishes and his characters felt real in those films because he gave an authentic performance.\n\nSmith, on the other hand, has a fine range of acting skills but I always find his depth lacking -- he never seems to step out of himself and into his character. Unlike say, [Jack Nicholson's ability to emote anger (and what drives that anger)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wK7TiA9qmuU), whenever I watch Smith trying to emote something but it feels more superficial, like there's nothing behind the scenes that is subconsciously driving that primary emotion. Outside of maybe *Bad Boys*, where he was still personally doubting whether or not he could make it on the big stage of Hollywood while also playing into his comedic background without trying to look like the coolest guy in the room, I can't say that I've ever felt Will Smith deliver a genuine performance. \n\nBut that's just my take on the matter.", "created_utc": 1571762071.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "f4r3g22", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_dlehz2", "parent_id": "t1_f4qhfla", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/dlehz2/gemini_man_is_a_huge_bomb_losing_at_least_75/f4r3g22/", "score": 19, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "chrisdelbosque", "author_id": "8200u", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Good shout; his presence is great, just not anything else.", "created_utc": 1571755925.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "f4qo2br", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_dlehz2", "parent_id": "t1_f4qhfla", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/dlehz2/gemini_man_is_a_huge_bomb_losing_at_least_75/f4qo2br/", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "JeffKuneDo", "author_id": "107fmjsg", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "And it was a reboot of an older, reasonably popular TV show.
