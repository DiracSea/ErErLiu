He has his detractors and defenders, among them animators and motion capture editors, people who have met Andy and found him a nice bloke, people who are interested in the art of animation or the in art of acting or in both. But so far I have seen nothing from anybody who was in the trenches and actually worked on Gollum, so I suppose it\u2019s time I weighed in on the matter.\n\nMy name\u2019s Randall William Cook, and I was the Director of Animation on the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy.\n\nI worked very closely with Andy. We met on the Mt. Ruapehu location in 1999 and began theorizing about what Gollum was all about (while Gollum was described as \u201cschizophrenic\u201d, I viewed the character as a drug addict trying to re-connect with his supply, a tack which Andy endorsed). We hung out on and off set, rafted together through the Waitomo Glowworm Caves, worked together on set during the live action filming (occasionally with me directing scenes Peter Jackson and I had prepared together), all the while on the trail of the elusive Gollum.\n\nThe discussion on this page seems to be focusing upon several points. Is Andy a good actor? I think so. He\u2019s certainly versatile (I had the pleasure of directing him, in his on-camera incarnation, when he played his death scene in Peter\u2019s KING KONG remake). Is he a nice bloke? Well, we have been guests in each other\u2019s homes, attended countless social functions together and generally enjoyed each other\u2019s company and respected each other\u2019s talent. I don\u2019t like hearing him called names, though I can understand the high emotions which lead some to do so. But all that is irrelevant to the real issue. When Andy uses the term \u201cDigital Makeup\u201d, he asserts that the on-screen depiction of Gollum is a 100% faithful representation of an Andy Serkis acting performance. This is, frankly, a misrepresentation of the facts.\n\nAs I have no personal experience of the \u201cperformance capture\u201d particulars of any of Andy\u2019s work post-RINGS, I cannot offer an opinion on what he has been up to since RETURN OF THE KING. But let me swear to you here that Gollum was not solely an Andy Serkis performance, with Andy\u2019s every move, gesture and tic scrupulously reproduced in a new, digital character. Rather, Gollum was a synthesis, a collaborative performance delivered by both Andy and a team of highly-skilled animation artists.\n\nPlease permit me to cite a few examples, in defense of my heretical assertions. THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING carried a single card credit, which declared \u201cAndy Serkis as GOLLUM\u201d. This was a bit of contractually-dictated press puffery which didn\u2019t accurately reflect Andy\u2019s participation in that first film. Fact is, Andy\u2019s physical participation in the first film was nonexistent. The first shot, Gollum alone in his cave, was my idea: Peter needed a shot of Gollum to play under the narration, and several ideas were posited. I thought that we needed a book illustration image, something that captured Gollum in a simple image. I acted out Gollum, crouched on a rock in a subterranean lake, obsessing over his Precious, looking around in paranoia for enemies who weren\u2019t there, and Peter bought that approach. I directed Weta Workshop\u2019s Ben Hawker in a mocap session, then animated on top of that (our 12-animator team was pretty busy, so I actually animated a bit on that show, myself). The next shot was a roto-mation job of Gollum\u2019s hands as he was being tortured; a nice makeup job, shot live action (Sasha Lees\u2019 hands made up, I believe), was compromised by jiggly rubber fingers, so the animation department copied the actor\u2019s movements. Mike Stevens animated the shot of Gollum following the Fellowship in Moria, then I animated the two close shots of Gollum, his fingers nervously twitching as he watches the Fellowship through a grate. One mo-cap shot, one roto-mation shot, and three keyframe shots. Andy\u2019s only participation: muttering the word \u201cprecious\u201d over one of the shots I\u2019d already animated.\n\nThe first Gollum scene filmed, in fact, was made as \u201cweather cover\u201d (an interior shot on a stand-by set, kept ready for when the weather turns foul, forbidding exterior filming). Though the first shot up, it was for the third film: a mountain top was built inside a nearby hotel\u2019s tennis court, and scenes were filmed with Frodo and Sam and Gollum. Frodo pulls Gollum up on a ledge, Gollum frames Sam with Lembas crumbs, Gollum and Sam fight. As Andy was not yet in New Zealand, I was elected to put on a leotard and stand in for Gollum. No photos exist of me in the getup, but let me assure you I looked a fine example of masculine grace and beauty. Really. A year or so later, Andy did a mo-cap session, basically reproducing my choreography. And Steven Hornby and others keyframed some of the shots from scratch as well.\n\nTWO TOWERS saw much more involvement from Andy. Several examples from that film. Gollum, after he has been tamed and led along on a rope, is released and scampers up onto a rock, showing the hobbits where they must go. This was filmed with Andy squatting on a rock. Sam and Frodo come up to him, Sam and Gollum have a staring contest, and Sam backs down. It bothered me that Sam was turning his back on Gollum, which seemed out of character, so back in Wellington I directed animator Atsushi Sato to have Gollum break his look, and precede Sam out of the shot. This isn\u2019t Digital Makeup, this isn\u2019t a \u201ctechnical\u201d chore, this is an acting choice. And it wasn\u2019t Andy\u2019s idea, but mine. And it was Atsushi Sato who \u201cplayed\u201d that moment, not Andy. It was a decision within my purview as Animation Director and Peter signed off on it.\n\nGollum hears the name Smeagol for the first time in 500 years. We used Andy\u2019s body mocap, but I didn\u2019t care for what I thought was Andy\u2019s too-busy facial performance, so I told Adam Valdez to ignore it and animate something subtler. He animated two shots and Linda Johnson animated the third, and they created a memorable acting moment which did not \u201chonor\u201d Andy\u2019s performance in the slightest. There were many times where we honored Andy\u2019s performance to the letter, but this wasn\u2019t one of \u2018em.\n\nThat film ends with a long mo-cap take of Gollum soliloquizing. Jason Schleifer, Adam Valdez and Mike Stevens had much to do with the acting of this scene, as the animation task was split among them. We also changed the choreography on that one, having Gollum advance emphatically toward the camera, having him wrap his hands around a branch and twist, as he throttles a hobbit in his imagination. Again, acting choices courtesy of the Weta Animation Department.\n\nWe stuck closer to Andy\u2019s performance in the third film, and as the mo-cap was refined a good deal it was used more. There was never what we know as performance capture, however, in any of the films. Ditto facial capture, for Gollum; it was all keyframed. And even when we did reproduce Andy\u2019s expressions with perfect fidelity, Peter or Fran would direct the animators through two, three, twelve or more iterations, with the animators working directly for the director, refining a performance in Andy\u2019s absence. Collaborating on that performance, in fact. I was honored to work on those films. Our Animation team was first rate, and I was proud to be associated with them (as well as the ones I mentioned, Melanie Cordan and Mary Victoria and many others brought their fine talents to bear in making Gollum act, through a superb facial system devised by Bay Raitt). They are artists, they can act, and they did all \u201cperform\u201d as Gollum to a greater or lesser degree. I don\u2019t see the difference between a performance delivered by a great actor or a great animator (I refer you to Brad Bird\u2019s films, or to TANGLED, if you doubt that an animator needs to lean on or be supplanted by an actor to give a moving performance).\n\nLet me state that Andy really should be considered the principal author of Gollum\u2019s performance, but there\u2019s a hell of a difference between principal author and sole author. The Animators who helped shape Gollum\u2019s performance are actors of a very special type, working at a high level of achievement. They\u2019re not like Marni Nixon singing for Natalie Wood in WEST SIDE STORY, doing only the things that Andy couldn\u2019t do: they were doing the same things Andy did, in concert with him, and significantly contributing to the realization of a memorable performance. I can\u2019t speak to the recent performances in Andy\u2019s \u201cperformance-capture\u201d career, but the animators on THE LORD OF THE RINGS were most certainly not \u201cdigital makeup artists\u201d, and nobody has any business saying that they were.\u201d", "created_utc": 1564407177.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "evc5vy7", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_cj97cl", "parent_id": "t1_evc0fu8", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/cj97cl/andy_serkis_to_receive_the_international/evc5vy7/", "score": 306, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "itsmeaningless", "author_id": "16yinanz", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "...Ah fuck.", "created_utc": 1564405201.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "evc3ib4", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_cj97cl", "parent_id": "t1_evc0fu8", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/cj97cl/andy_serkis_to_receive_the_international/evc3ib4/", "score": 97, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "You would think taking the high road would further his career more than trampling over the bodies of those he worked with.

If so, no.\n\nPerformance capture isn't necessarily easier than hand-animating, and often times requires someone to go in by hand to make adjustments or to reanimate the scene in total. What performance capture does is what it sounds like, it captures motion, performances. The act of walking, jumping, kneeling, smiling, sneering, hissing, what have you. What it doesn't do, however, is effortlessly transform a man into an ape. Someone had to make that ape model, someone else had to rig the model for animation, another person had to dress it up to look good, someone had to import the motion capture data to the model to see if it would look natural, and that same someone typically has to make adjustments to the animations to fit the scene. \n\nSay they capture Andy Serkis saying \"We love olives\" in a scene. Facial capture lines up well with the monkey face and after several tens of hours of adjustments, it looks damn near natural. But oh no, they were shooting an outdated version of the script and there have been several rewrites and the line is now \"I hate melons.\" Andy Serkis is busy with another project, so all he could spare is about one or two 4 hour sessions of voice recording to record new dialogue. They already have his performance, so he doesn't have to do anything else, right?\n\nWell, he doesn't, but the animators do. The mouth movements for \"We love olives\", and \"I hate melons\" are actually pretty different, so all they have to do is throw out his lip sync and add some new motion to the lips and it's done. Couldn't be simpler. \n\nActually, no. The emotion of the lines have changed, \"love\" to \"hate\", so the animators have to look for something in the hours upon hours of performance capture to find something they could use. Maybe they could reuse the data from a cut scene to make his eyebrows mean and nose scrunched up. But that won't work because when you talk, you talk with your whole face and not just your mouth. Nose scrunches up, cheeks wrinkle, chin dimples, all sorts of things. So at the end of the day, they most likely reanimate the face by hand and use some footage or other animations as a reference.\n\nThat montage is impressive because of the amount of work that goes into it to make it look easy. Like all you have to do is press a \"make monkey\" button.\n\n\n\n***TL;DR***: **It's still true.

He didn't figure out how to put on a mocap suit, he was told how to do that on set. And again, I'm not even trying to diminish his accomplishments. He's a good actor, but there are plenty of those. And I haven't really seen accomplished actors \"fail\" at doing a mocap performance. I don't think Benedict Cumberbatch had a history of doing mocap before delivering an excellent Smaug (*whatever one may think of those movies as a whole*). I could look for other examples but I think it gets the point across.\n\nDuring the making of LOTR, there were no schools that taught mocap or any of the advanced animation techniques that were being invented at the time. And on every subsequent production Serkis was part of, new technologies were being invented and artists had to learn a lot more about physics, material science and software to make those characters come to life. The people who did that *wrote* the books that are now taught in schools. And even those schools can't bring you to their level in just 4 years. It takes a great deal of personal passion and dedication to actually specialize to the degree that you could work at a studio like WETA.\n\n> Because he doesn't go \"oh yes, it was very tough be we really have to give thanks to....\" every time someone talks to him about his roles?\n\nHe's repeated in multiple interviews that he thinks of the VFX artists as people who apply digital makeup, and it's their primary job to just deliver the performance that the actor gives them.\n\n> If companies could save money by having anyone do what he does, he wouldn't be employed at all - he's more expensive than some random Joe-Schmo.\n\nCompanies can't save money that way, because big name actors attract big audiences. \n\n> He takes a stab @ Serkis for saying the artists do their job in post-production... VFX is so fucking obviously post-production\n\nTraditionally, post-production refers to everything after principal photography right? I don't think that definition makes much sense anymore when all the filming is done with a relatively small crew over the course of a few months, and then a *legion* of digital artists spend more than a year transforming that into the spectacle we see on screen. If you don't want to call that \"production\", then fine. We would only disagree on terminology.\n\n> Shit sources.\n\nHe's not a source for anything but his own opinion. He cites the thing he's responding to. I happen to agree and that's why I posted it. I can find you plenty of articles about people (from inside the industry, and outside) who are upset at how dismissive Serkis has been about the importance of VFX artists.
