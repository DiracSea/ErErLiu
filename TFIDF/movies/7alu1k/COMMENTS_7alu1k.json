Businesses were leaving for more lucrative locations, there was no decent retail, entertainment, or really any decent districts. Companies were moving operations to the outer city, or just out of the city period. The transportation industry has always been strong here, due to its prime location for shipments crossing the country.\n\nThe rehabilitation of the city very and truly started with the building of the Hoosier (later RCA) Dome in downtown Indianapolis area and the move that brought the Colts here in 1984. It brought with it a lot of investments that helped rehab the city zoo to be one of the best around, it helped bring the Eiteljorg Museum to life, it helped make the Indianapolis Children's Museum even better, and so on. \n\nAlong with it was a common add-on to stadiums, the Convention Center. These early investments led to an invigorated economy, which led to the Circle Center mall, a very popular bar district, lots of restaurants, and brought businesses back to the city. The building of Lucas Oil Stadium, and remodeling of the Convention Center, along with previous additions, like Victory Field for the AAA Indians, Conseco (now Bankers Life) Fieldhouse for the Pacers, and downtown Indianapolis is a pretty cool city to visit. It's not Chicago or New York, of course, but it has its own life again.\n\nIt can be argued that all that could have happened without the Colts, but it was definitely a huge incentive that breathed life back into a dying city.

Under the same rule, Gearbox Software would need to pay the US government around $30K in order to keep the Duke out of public domain.\n\nThis would allow both large and small companies to maintain the rights to their intellectual properties as long as they wish, but as I said in my original post, would allow dormant properties that aren't renewed to enter the public domain. \n\nRemember, as copyright law currently stands, these corporations are able to keep all of this shit *for free*.\n\nAnd it would also give the US government a new revenue source for shit like schools, repairing our crumbling infrastructure, national parks or other cool shit. \n\n", "created_utc": 1509762841.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dpbj42z", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7alu1k", "parent_id": "t1_dpbhy6f", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7alu1k/disney_didnt_allow_reporters_from_the_la_times/dpbj42z/", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "centersolace", "author_id": "8w6t6", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Dicks are just funny.", "created_utc": 1509769178.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dpbneu3", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7alu1k", "parent_id": "t1_dpbkb3h", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7alu1k/disney_didnt_allow_reporters_from_the_la_times/dpbneu3/", "score": 6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "L4cer8", "author_id": "5ssmj", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Except for Google Music on iOS... ugh...
