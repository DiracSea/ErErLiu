They have a theater in Beverly Hills where they show screenings of recent releases, awards nominees, as well as other special events.  (For instance, the recent screening of [HEAT in 4K](http://deadline.com/2016/09/heat-michael-mann-robery-de-niro-al-pacino-christopher-nolan-1201815118/).)  \n\nA bunch of months back, I had an opportunity to join my friend at a super-private screening of David Lean's *Ryan's Daughter*.  (By  \"super-private\", I mean: the theater seats probably 750 and 40 people were there.)   For those who might not be familiar, this film \u2013 released in 1970 \u2013 was on the heals of several wildly successful epics directed by Lean, including *The Bridge on the River Kwai*, *Lawrence of Arabia*, and *Dr. Zhivago*.  Clocking in at over 3hrs, the film has an intermission... and the only other thing I was told was that it was a romantic WWI epic filmed and set in Ireland.  I had no clue what I was getting myself into.  Except that it stars Robert Mitchum.  I like Robert Mitchum.  Anyway...\n\nMy friend didn't offer too many specifics about the screening except that there would be pizza available beforehand and to show up on time.  So I did.\n\nPlease note, the theater has an expansive reception area when you enter, so when there's around only 40 people in attendance, it looks downright empty.  They had a few high-top tables set up for Academy employees to enjoy their pizza.  Which made it easy to find my friend.  He was at the table about ten feet in front of me.  I knew he wasn't at the high-top right beside it because that table had Christopher Nolan, Steven Spielberg and Nolan's DP standing at it.  \nYeah.  I did my best to keep my filmgeekness to a minimum.  Act normal.  Act normal...\n\nAfter striding casually up to my friend (which probably [looked like this](http://i.makeagif.com/media/4-01-2015/mOQdBK.gif), I asked something casually like, \"WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?\"  Friend replied that the whole reason for the screening was that Nolan wanted to see a 70mm print of *Ryan's Daughter* because there were elements of the film he wanted to see to help him with the making of *DUNKIRK*.  The Academy had the print and a place to show it, so Nolan offered to buy everyone pizza if he could screen the film there.  So there ya go.\nThe cool thing was how entirely relaxed these guys were.  There appeared to be 3 people there with Nolan & Spielberg, and none of them were handlers, assistants or \u2013 I dunno \u2013 body guards.  Just them, the others they needed there to watch the film, and that's it.  And like a bunch of teenagers, they all sat in the second row with their feet up so they could be entirely consumed by the film.  Also great to see: I didn't see a single Academy employee (or any of their +1's) approach, bother or selfie any of them the whole time.\n\nSo, of course, my friend and I spent the entire film trying to dissect \"What about this film is Nolan looking to see?!?\"  And for the entire first Act (not story-structure-wise, I mean pre-intermission), we had zero clue.  The story hasn't held up too well over time, and although the cinematography is beautiful, there wasn't anything revelatory.  Which of course led to an intense discussion and joking during the intermission \u2013 in part because of a few characters would now be seen as pretty cringe-worthy stereotypes.  (One in particular, but I'll let you be the judge of which for when you see it.  Hint: he won an Oscar for the role.)  \n\nAnd then there was the second act.  WOW.  The story doesn't necessarily improve all that much, but man were there some impressive shots.  You really will need to see it for yourself.  Set on the coast of Ireland, Lean decided to film where he did because it was \"guaranteed\" to fall victim of a few terrible storms every year.  And his film called for a ~40min sequence set during a hurricane-level storm.  Amusingly enough, production was shut down for quite a while because of an unusually benign storm season.  But when it finally hit: POW.  On 70mm, the storm is overpowering and HUGE.  \n\nWhich of course leads to some additional joking on our part after the film:  *Of course*, Nolan had wanted to see the film to take in and figure out how Lean had shot this epic storm.  The fact of the matter is (although there were some special effects), Lean literally *filmed during the storm*.  Doing that is one thing, capturing it is another.  So here's to hoping that Nolan's *DUNKIRK* has some equally-impressive storm sequences of his troops along the coast thanks to what he learned watching *Ryan's Daughter*.  If you're a Nolan junky, I'd highly recommend watching the film with an eye for what he may have gleaned from it.

It seemed really odd that among seasoned thespians like Kenneth Branagh, Mark Rylance, Cillian Murphy, and Tom Hardy, a young pop singer named Harry Styles of One Direction fame was added to the cast. Cynics might have thought: well obviously he's there to juice the gross and get the box office receipts flowing.  \n  \nThen you dig into Harry Styles's family tree and learn that his grandfather was none other than the war hero Jerry Styles. Jerry and his twin brother Larry spent much of the Dunkirk evacuation singing songs to cheer up the evacuees. Despite frequent bombardments from the Germans, they took turns singing everything from ballads to shanties, just to keep spirits high and to keep the evacuees headed in one direction (from which the band takes its name) to safety.     \n  \nGrandson Harry will portray both Jerry and Larry in a dual role, and Oscar buzz is already building.

There are some docs that are great at encapsulating the macro events, others that are great at explaining detailed individual events. \n\n**'World at War'** is by far the most in-depth documentary that will provide the most information and is the one most people will recommend. Since it's also ~50 years old it has the advantage of interviews with lots of people that provide first-hand accounts (including interviews with Albert Speer which are incredible IMO). It's like 20 hours long, yet I must have seen it 4 or 5 times. This is the one 'essential' documentary on WW2.\n\nThe more modern documentaries which do a good job of macro context would be **'World War 2 in Colour'**  and **'Apocalypse: The Second World War'**. Both are on Netflix, both have god-awful titles, but both are pretty great. Though they overlap quite a bit.\n\nWWII in HD by the History Channel is pretty bad. They go for spectacle, not information. Probably my least favorite of the macros.\n\nOne of my favorite micro docs is **'The Goebbels Experiment'** because I'm consistently fascinated by how an entire country of tens of millions became seeming entranced. To me that is the true monster of WW2, not Hitler. Hitler was just one man, it was the willingness of humanity to form a religious relationship with the State that is the most terrifying .... and Goebbels was the architect of that 'religion'.\n\nThere are a bunch of docs currently on Netflix done by **David Reynolds** which are fantastic. **'WWII: 1941 and the Man of Steel'** is my favorite because it gives a much more informative perspective on Stalin which many other docs gloss over. \n\nThere are some relatively silly docs that actually provide great information; **'Nazi Mega Weapons'** comes to mind. There were some *insanely ambitious* projects being done in secret that came very close to completion. \n\n**'WW2 from Space'** is yet another great doc with a shitty title. \n\nMy favorite dramatic depiction of WW2 (outside of Band of Brothers/Pacific) is definitely **'The Heavy Water War' AKA 'The Saboteurs'**.

They were also working on (in their words) a 'huge sci-fi film' (Star Wars) and a 'film featuring a giant green guy' (Avengers Age of Ultron)......as well as a plethora of video game projects (Rome?) and Andy Serkis' own Jungle Book movie, which will be out in a couple of years from now I think.\n\nAndy wasn't actually there, but I was shown around by [Ants Farrell](http://www.imaginariumuk.com/mobile/assets/images/our_people/imagineers/03.jpg), who eagle-eyed fans will recognise from behind-the-scenes features for Peter Jackson's films (he's originally a New Zealander who worked on all of Jackson's films, but had moved to London to work with Serkis). You can just about see him looking towards the camera at the front of [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/PQ5mvWB.jpg).\n\nThe studio is quite small - it's little more than a single studio with a small row of computers/technicians.....but being based in a unit in Ealing Studios means they're paying, I think, thousands a day or something to be there. The costs are insane - more about that later!\n\nThey had some actors in mo-cap (correction: performance capture!) suits to demo their setup - they were performing a scene that the computers were rendering as an English farce in a stately home with some [cartoonish-looking characters](http://i.imgur.com/jBbDKXc.jpg). It was quite funny, with some cool action etc.\n\nHere's how it happened: the actors would be performing the scene in their mocap suits, within the 'volume'. The 'volume' is the name of the space within the dozens of special 'cameras' [rigged around the room](http://i.imgur.com/PQ5mvWB.jpg) - I can't remember exactly how many there were, but each one costs \u00a325k or something insane. The costs are INCREDIBLE. Those 'cameras' are using infrared or something to pick up the dots/balls attached to the mocap suits, thus feeding performance data onto programmed 'skeletons' in the computers.\n\nThe actors perform their scene, and the performance/scene is captured in the computer.\n\nWhat's NOT captured is any kind of cinematic camera, so to speak. The scene is played out like theatre, and the director can come in later with their 'virtual camera' to actually film the scene in any number of ways and shots.\n\nThe ['virtual camera'](http://i.imgur.com/PAClhur.jpg) isn't actually a camera at all. It's a small, portable monitor with a series of mocap balls attached to it that the infrared cameras are picking up - this camera is itself a form of mocap. The director can see a live preview of the scene on this monitor, even though the scene was recorded minutes/hours/weeks/years earlier! It allows them to replay the actors' performance over and over again, while experimenting with new shots, angles, movements etc. From this rig the director can also add enhanced movement, like adjusting the camera's relative position on various axes (e.g. they could make the camera appear to be further up than the director can physically move the camera themselves) - it's liberating! This is how James Cameron shot the Na'vi in Avatar, it's how Spielberg shot Tintin and I think Peter Jackson even used it to create large portions of the Hobbit (especially the Battle, I think) essentially in post-production. People give Jackson a lot of flack for the Hobbit, but when you keep in mind that the poor guy had little-to-no prep time for a lot of those films, no storyboarding time etc - guy's a GENIUS for being able to create the cinema he did in the way that he did.\n\nAnyway, I got to demo the virtual camera, and it was as incredible as you'd expect - I was composing shots and filming a scene that I'd seen performed with my own eyes ten minutes ago - yet here it was playing out in realtime in front of me. It's a paradigm shift in cinematic direction, and it was Avatar that pioneered it.\n\nI loved Favreau's Jungle Book to bits, but I can't wait to see what Serkis does with his.\n\n[BONUS Tintin statues!](http://i.imgur.com/hCC9d0K.jpg)", "created_utc": 1475269496.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d88t3yi", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_557jtn", "parent_id": "t1_d88kpym", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/557jtn/christopher_nolan_is_said_to_be_getting_20/d88t3yi/", "score": 12, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Keyserson", "author_id": "d4m5i", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "He also owns a portion of a few succesful restraunts.\nand also is a seed funder for In n out burger who needed capital a few years ago to start expanding into other states . so he is doing really well for himself.\n", "created_utc": 1475253003.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d88gsy6", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_557jtn", "parent_id": "t1_d88gk1p", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/557jtn/christopher_nolan_is_said_to_be_getting_20/d88gsy6/", "score": 14, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "GandalfLuvzDick", "author_id": "mu8ig", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Nah i prob would do it for thousands.\npeople reading this think  pfft funny.\nBut 20k is a lot of money for 2 minutes of work.\nim down", "created_utc": 1475250600.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d88ezam", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_557jtn", "parent_id": "t1_d88evdc", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/557jtn/christopher_nolan_is_said_to_be_getting_20/d88ezam/", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "GandalfLuvzDick", "author_id": "mu8ig", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "First thing that comes to mind when i think of that movie is Jack Black weaving through a stampede of dinosaurs while making sure his camera and tripod are safe.", "created_utc": 1475242860.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d889jnj", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_557jtn", "parent_id": "t1_d8896qp", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/557jtn/christopher_nolan_is_said_to_be_getting_20/d889jnj/", "score": 55, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "nerveonya", "author_id": "pnnfr", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I see your awesome bug scene, but I raise it with Naomi Watts having a date in Central Park with an escaped Kong and nobody around them until an artillery strike comes in. \n\nThat was a dumb scene.", "created_utc": 1475245451.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d88b8d2", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_557jtn", "parent_id": "t1_d88at3s", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/557jtn/christopher_nolan_is_said_to_be_getting_20/d88b8d2/", "score": 20, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "barandor", "author_id": "ew9n9", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Even in the bug scene you can see Jack Black doing a cossack dance to get the bugs off his legs.

For example, as part of the largest naval battle in history, surrounding the American reconquest of the Phillipines in 1944, there was a localized battle off Samar in which a massive force of Japanese battleships and cruisers descended upon a completely unprepared and outmatched group of American ships. What followed is arguably the greatest and most heroic action in US Naval history.\n\nThe Japanese had succeeded in achieving total tactical surprise after the greater part of American the fleet, including all major US carriers and battleships, had been fooled into chasing a diversionary force of Japanese carriers manned by skeleton crews and armed with very few aircraft. What remained to protect the US Army landing craft was Taffy 3, a force of a few 'tin can' destroyers and small support carriers whose aircraft were armed mainly with depth charges for the purpose of dealing with the possibility of a submarine attack. To illustrate the difference in armaments between the Americans and the Japanese in this battle, the Japanese had with them the largest battleship of all time (the Yamato) with 16 inch guns and over a foot of armor, while the Americans had small destroyer escorts with 5 inch guns and about 1/2 inch of armor. Also, the Americans were severely outnumbered.\n\nWhile the escort carriers retreated, they launched their fighter bombers which lobbed depth charges, torpedoes, and literally anything they had at the encroaching Japanese battleships and heavy cruisers. When they ran out of ordinance, the pilots conducted dry runs against the enemy, knowing that the ships would try to maneuver out of the way thus slowing them down and giving the carriers more time. At least one pilot even opened his window and shot at the Japanese with his .38 revolver. \n\nMeanwhile, the other American warships, just three destroyers and four destroyer escorts, which were initially retreating with the carriers, heroically turned around and faced the Japanese onslaught directly. Even though their guns couldn't penetrate the enemy's armor, the US destroyers did have two viable weapons in their arsenal. Their torpedoes could do serious damage to just about any ship, and they were equipped with relatively advanced fire control computers (analog) which meant that their weak 5 inch guns could target soft spots like the bridge of enemy ships. For hours they fought a hard battle, in rough seas and stormy weather, still fighting even when they were dead in the water. While the Americans lost five vessels, they still managed to sink three Japanese heavy cruisers. The captain of the USS Johnston, one of the US destroyers, was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his valor. Several survivors even reported that they witnessed the captain of a Japanese destroyer saluting the sinking USS Johnston as his own destroyer passed by.\n\nIn the end, the outmanned and outgunned forces of Taffy 3 put up such a ferocious resistance that the far superior force of Japenese ships retreated. The Japanese commander, unable to communicate with the diversionary force, didn't know that their plan had worked, and assumed that the Americans didn't retreat because their main fleet was still close by. Ultimately this was the last time the IJN would have sufficient forces to take the initiative, and from this point on they were no longer able to challenge American naval dominance in the Pacific.", "created_utc": 1475256331.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d88jd2c", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_557jtn", "parent_id": "t1_d88d9xj", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/557jtn/christopher_nolan_is_said_to_be_getting_20/d88jd2c/", "score": 197, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "U-235", "author_id": "4c5so", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I'm sure it would make people scatter.", "created_utc": 1475248534.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d88dflo", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_557jtn", "parent_id": "t1_d88d9xj", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/557jtn/christopher_nolan_is_said_to_be_getting_20/d88dflo/", "score": 54, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "doktorvivi", "author_id": "8vao0", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "My granddad told a story about when he flew PBY Catalina's on Guadalcanal they used to drop empty beer bottles out the window after their bombs were exhausted because they would make about the same sound as a bomb coming down, just to terrify the Japanese.", "created_utc": 1475250110.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d88em28", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_557jtn", "parent_id": "t1_d88d9xj", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/557jtn/christopher_nolan_is_said_to_be_getting_20/d88em28/", "score": 24, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Cummode_Drag0n", "author_id": "oppef", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "They also had cannons so between the siren and the gunfire they must have been scary as he'll.
