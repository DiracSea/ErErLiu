I fucking love *The Postman*. Prepare for a geek out!  \n\nI've actually read the novel it's based on, and it's *completely different*, sharing nothing but a basic premise, with virtually none of the same characters, story, etc. - so I'll brook none of this \"The book was better!\" nonsense. Even David Brin himself has said that each should stand on its own merits, because they're clearly thoroughly different stories.  \n\nThat being said...the movie version of *The Postman* has some truly terrific, subtle, elegant world-building, the kind of thing that lets you understand the context and feel like there's a whole history to this world, without someone having to sit down and lecture the protagonist (standing in for the audience) about \"how we got here\" or some shit like that. As just a couple of examples: when the postman and Bill are walking across some desolate flatlands and come across an abandoned floating dock, just sitting in this desert, and take a second to jump on the now-surreal diving board. Or, my personal favourite: when General Bethlehem, having been informed that the forces opposing him are that of \"the United States government,\" angrily replies that \"There *is no* \"United States government;\" I was *at* the Battle of Georgetown, and I *watched* the White House burn!\" That's the only mention of what is obviously a *massive* culmination of tremendous historical events in the whole movie - that one little line - and yet, it tells us so much about this setting, this character, the whole history of this world, in a way that is not the least bit didactic or inelegant.  \n\nAll that aside, though, there is one perfect thing about *The Postman* which means that I will have to love it forever, no matter what: [the casting of Tom Petty, *playing himself*, as the mayor of post-apocalyptic Portland, OR.](#spoiler)  \n\n[Let's unpack that for a second, shall we? And remember: *nothing remotely like that is in the book*. This means that there once was a screenwriter, writing a movie in the 1990s, set in US Pacific Northwest, but in post-apocalyptic 2013. One of the significant locations of the story is \"Bridge City\" (presumably the remnants of Portland)...and this screenwriter, *for no reason other than that it would be weird and cool*, writes *Tom fuckin' Petty*, of Heartbreakers fame, into the script as the mayor of Bridge City. Not Tom Petty, actor, *playing* this character; rather, *in this fictional post-apocalyptic world*, Tom Petty *the person* has somehow found himself the mayor of Bridge City...such that our protagonist, the unnamed postman, upon encountering him during his first visit to Bridge City, basically says, *in character*, \"Holy shit! You're Tom Petty! Man, you were really famous before *our entire civilization collapsed!* Hey, if I found a guitar amongst all this rubble, would you maybe play, like, an acoustic version of 'Running Down a Dream' or something?\"](#spoiler)  \n\n[*What an amazing thing to write into a movie like this!* Besides being hilariously entertaining and sort of unprecedented in such a somber atmosphere, it also (somehow) even adds a weird dose of realism to the setting. Like...why *wouldn't* Tom Petty survive the collapse of civilization in the US? And why *wouldn't* people still remember that he used to be a famous rock star? And, in the new absence of mass media networks and the kind of celebrity we're used to...why wouldn't he instead apply his natural charisma and love for his fans toward a political career caring for the remaining citizens of Bridge City? For some reason, I can't imagine this working if it had been, say, Mick Jagger or David Bowie or...Dee Snider? But for some reason, it *totally works* with Tom Petty!](#spoiler)  \n\nedit: typo/formatting", "created_utc": 1540484061.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1540484404.0, "id": "e8flmrs", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_9ra62n", "parent_id": "t1_e8febls", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/9ra62n/taron_egerton_training_for_the_upcoming_robin/e8flmrs/", "score": 6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "john_stuart_kill", "author_id": "i3ele", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Yeah and the colors look wonderful for such and old movie.", "created_utc": 1540481588.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e8fijmc", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_9ra62n", "parent_id": "t1_e8fefmb", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/9ra62n/taron_egerton_training_for_the_upcoming_robin/e8fijmc/", "score": 14, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "thesoundabout", "author_id": "1050rqsv", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "How old are you, dude??", "created_utc": 1540479738.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e8fg9u1", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_9ra62n", "parent_id": "t1_e8fej1x", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/9ra62n/taron_egerton_training_for_the_upcoming_robin/e8fg9u1/", "score": 9, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "RyantheAustralian", "author_id": "7iujp", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Fairbanks was good but Adventures of Robin Hood simply towers over his.", "created_utc": 1540481162.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e8fi0is", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_9ra62n", "parent_id": "t1_e8fej1x", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/9ra62n/taron_egerton_training_for_the_upcoming_robin/e8fi0is/", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "mrbooze", "author_id": "73twz", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "The score seals it for Flynn.", "created_utc": 1540483211.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e8fkkgr", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_9ra62n", "parent_id": "t1_e8fh3m2", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/9ra62n/taron_egerton_training_for_the_upcoming_robin/e8fkkgr/", "score": 8, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "TheNorthComesWithMe", "author_id": "10s4aj", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Who is *still alive*.

The director chose to place nearly all of the action in the entire movie in the center of the frame. So if you drew a circle the height of the screen covering the entire frame from top to bottom and left to right as wide as it needs to be to still remain a circle, nearly everything important to the story action-wise will be in that circle for almost the whole film. They did this so that way the viewer wouldnt have to move their eyes too much and potentially miss some of the action due to eye travel time. The fact that it was done intentionally is what impressed me.
