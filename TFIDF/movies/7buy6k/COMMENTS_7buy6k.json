We have a habit of seeing musicians and stand up comedians this way because their work, by nature, usually comes from a singular, personal source and is meant to connect with us and that one-on-one connection is what creates this idea that there is a relationship there.  There isn't.  The relationship isn't between you and them, but rather you as an audience and them as a performance and that relationship ends when the performance is over and you cease to be an audience; but it's hard to separate that when you leave and we have a tendency to carry it with us.\n\nIt's something we as a society need to work on too and it's only something I started doing the last few years, whereas as a teenager and in my early twenties, I was in head/heels with celebrities as my heroes and following interviews and learning about their lives and their drama, etc.  But there comes a point when you realize that the only honest and valuable thing any artist, politician or public figure has to say is said in their work and the credibility of their work is what gives *them* power, not the other way around.  Everything else is just marketing, promotion, an act, a statement, a performance.\n\nI don't mean to say all celebrities are cheating us.  I don't blame them.  It's not that different from social media; of course we all want to present our best face, picture, moments.  Very few people are going to upload their weakest moments, their indulging in temptations, their insecurities.  None of us want to be judged by our worst moments and that's just as true of them.  And they are just as much victims of it, where we all (feeling like we have a relationship with them) want to know about their private moments, follow their families and lives outside of their work, invading their privacy, making a market out of their daily lives.\n\nMy point is simply that *that* relationship doesn't exist, it's an illusion.  We don't know these people enough to dissect them, to have an understanding of them, to have a relationship of any level with them.  We only know their work, which we can dissect, appreciate, keep and carry.  Our relationship with a comedian is with his performance, with an author is in his writing, with a musician is with their music.  \n\nAs a civilization, we haven't figured this whole 'celebrity' thing out yet and there's a lot that still needs to be changed.  Chief among them is this problem that we *know* these people and have any sort of relationship with them.
