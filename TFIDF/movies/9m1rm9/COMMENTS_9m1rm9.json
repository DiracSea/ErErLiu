After meeting a few people at a con once, I was invited for drinks afterwards and had the pleasure of sitting next to Scott. He was exactly like you would expect a grandpa figure to be; kind, helpful, wise, and filled with stories about cats lol.\n\nI\u2019ll share my favorite story from that evening; it was how he got a particular troublemaker cat to learn to stay off his furniture. He had tried everything, and nothing was deterring this cat from getting on (or tearing up) his nice couch. So he put scotch tape, sticky side up, all over and around his couch, and sprinkled it with pepper. He went on to describe the hilarity as the cat struggled with immense difficulty to get the tape off after it made the mistake of approaching the couch.\n\nAs the days went on, he used less and less scotch tape, but more slowly he would decrease the amount of pepper he sprinkled. The cat quickly learned to avoid the couch for fear of invisible tape, and the smell of pepper helped to communicate it. Anytime he wanted to deter the car away from something, he could just sprinkle pepper around it. \n\nWhile I didnt know Scott personally, I had a great time meeting him. He definitely made all of us laugh that evening, and I believe he will be missed dearly by those who were close to him. \nRIP Scott", "created_utc": 1538913690.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e7bt3kk", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_9m1rm9", "parent_id": "t3_9m1rm9", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/9m1rm9/scott_wilson_actor_in_the_walking_dead_and_in/e7bt3kk/", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Activeangel", "author_id": "kenh9", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Scott Wilson was brilliant - so underrated!\n\nHerschel was my fave character.

Would you let me tell you a story?\n\nMy grandpa had Parkinson's and psuedo-lukemia (myodisplastic syndrome) I took him for 6 hour long monthly transfusions 60 miles away every month for 5 years.  When he heard the news about Robin Williams he said \"maybe he had the right idea.\"  I couldn't disagree with him.  Parkinson's was a special kind of hell.  First he couldn't shoot guns with me anymore. Couldn't write.  Couldn't shovel his own sidewalk.   Couldn't drive.  Walk. Stand. On his own.  \n\nSo at 19 I dropped out of college and I became his caretaker because my mom wasn't physically strong enough to hold him up to get to the toilet.  5 years I worked a full time job in water/wastewater treatment and took care of Grandpa.  I harbor zero bad feelings about that time in my life.  I'm 26 now, he gave me his home when he passed, as payment for everything, but I'd have done it for free.  It was a nice surprise when I found out though.\n\nIn his prime he was 6'2 and 200 lbs.  When I took him to the hospital the last time he was hunched over from the Parkinson's to about 5'3 And weighed 130lbs.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is, some people have to live it out because they can't pull the plug so-to-speak.  And believe me, if he had a plug to pull he would have looked at me and said \"I'm tired, let me go\" and even though a part of me went with him, I would have had to do it.\n\nWhen I comes to end of life care remember it's about what they need.  Sometimes putting an end to their misery is the right choice.  I know that sometimes it feels like you were throwing him away, at least I felt that way about 6 weeks before that last trip to the hospital when he and I had decided no more transfusions, no more needle pokes, uncomfortable car rides, extended stay waiting rooms.  I still feel that way once in a while.  But he had no friends his own age.  No quality of life.  No freedom.  And he was sick, and tired.  And just wanted to sleep.  So he went to sleep.\n\nI was at work when he passed after about 2 weeks in the hospital.  The nurses told me his last words were \"come on Grump.\"  Grumpy was the dog he had in high school, when he tended sheep camp in the mountains near our home.  I wish I could have been there by his side, but at the same time the image of him walking into the mountains with his dog, all alone.  Is so beautiful, and how he would have wanted to go out.  I wish for his sake, he could have gone sooner.\n\n\n\nSorry for rambling just got to thinking and I couldn't help myself.
