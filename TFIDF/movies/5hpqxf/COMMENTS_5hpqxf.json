Many of the movies are very low budget which will turn some people off straight away, but this is intended more for those who have seen most major offerings this year and are looking for deeper cuts.\n\nIn terms of guaging popularity I tried to stick to films with under 2k IMDb votes (by comparison Victoria, which I've seen on similar lists, is sitting on nearly 30k), but this wasn't a hard-and-fast rule. I judged the time period by Australian (or, failing that, VOD) release dates and didn't count early festival screenings.\n\nI've watched over 150 films released this year to arrive at this list, including an absurd amount of cinematic garbage, so hopefully it's been worthwhile! I'm happy to discuss any of these selections or offer further recommendations/uninformed opinions (after I wake up), and I always love hearing from people who have checked out one of the listed films.\n\nEnjoy!
