So here it is:\n\nThings will often be somewhat hectic if you go to see IT in theaters opening weekend. It is hard to handle the massive crowds for many theaters because this movie comes after a massive summer of lower rating movies that drew in far less. Plus with school having just started up, we lose some employees. Lines at concessions may be bad, but more so, the line to get in might be bad. Please be patient, and let us get our work done.\n\nI was working as an usher last night. We had three theaters showing \"IT\" all sold out at almost 300 people. There are only three of us, so there is only so much we can get done in a certain amount of time. We will be doing as much as we can to get the theaters cleaned and turned around for you, but it might leave you waiting in line a little longer than normal. Horror movies tend to leave a lot more trash. Rows absolutely covered in popcorn and trash. With that comes a longer clean time. Please do not try to rush in to the theatre, leading the line with you, it makes our job a lot harder. Please do not yell at us for \"taking too long.\" And please do not expect us to be able to get every nook and cranny clean. Certain things will be missed, we are very literally running to get things done.\n\nAlso, don't be the asshat that argues over a sold out movie. It happens every time. \"What, sold out! No just sell me a ticket I can stand! Bullshit just let me stand!\" We can not do that. Sold out means sold out, show up earlier, or go to a later showing.\n\nAnd finally for the parents: Kids. If your child is not 17 or older with ID they can not watch the movie alone. You can not buy the ticket for them and leave. We had to refund at least 50 tickets last night while being berated by angry parents, all for following corporate guidelines that exist at almost every single theatre. We have no choice, it is our job. If I were to let them in, I can be fired. I understand the anger, but it is in no way our fault. Either watch with them, or wait for it to come out on dvd or digital.\n\nI really hope you all get to enjoy watching it. I hate big weekends like this because it makes us all overly stressed, and therefor a little more on edge. All I want for those who come to my place of work is that they get to have as good an experience as possible, and we work hard to give that to you. But with massive weekends like this it gets extremely tough and exhausting. We will all probably end up dealing wth multiple horrible customers yelling at or insulting us, mostly the kids caught sneaking in who will try to fight us or curse at us for as long as they can. We are all going to be carrying a lot of weight behind the scenes. I am not saying this to change your experience, I simply wish to let people know that employees who seem a little cold, or who seem stressed, there is a reason. Please enjoy the movie, and be nice to the employees around you. You have no idea how much it means to see a smile and a thank you in a sea of people who are angry because they had to wait an extra four minutes on their popcorn. \n\nEdit: well, no longer a movie theatre employee. Quit my job and left tonight. Spent the last two years getting berated by angry parents and kids, while managers acted like we were out of line for creating work for them (aka not selling tickets to minors, also known as our fucking job.). Gm was in the box office tonight and snapped at me for literally quoting the signs we have all over the box office and front door that read \"Anyone under the age of 17 watching an R rated movie must be accompanied by someone 25 years of age or older.\" claiming that \"it isn't a rule!\" before walking out. Asked him what the rule was following that and he angrily just said \"they have to be with their parents!\" As if I can fucking tell if they are the parents magically. How about the next mom who has an interracial marriage and child comes up, I deny them service for not seeing proof of relation. So, I spent an hour going over it. I had hated this job for well over a year, mainly due to management problems. Finally came to the decision that if I didn't just get it done with I would keep putting it off, so I gave them my shit and left.
