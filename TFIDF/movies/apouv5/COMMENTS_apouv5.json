It keeps Will Smith's likeness, but also leaves the uncanny valley territory because as OP stated, Genie was extremely animated, even for an animated movie character. To go from something with so much facial and vocal (Robin Williams' amazing voice performance) fluidity to a blue Will Smith talking in ebonics is a huge leap.  \n\nAs others have noted, this genie will be Will's genie, he's not performing in the shadow of Robin, and instead of trying to do what he did, he'll be doing Genie his way, which I'm totally open for. It's just that the visual jump from 2D/Fluid to Static and uncanny valley 3D is really jarring, and like the tweet I linked, if live action genie's face was a bit more fictional, I think the concerns about it looking creepy would dissipate.    \n\nAs someone who grew up watching Aladdin and Hercules about 1000 times, I really want them to get this movie right, and I hope they alter Will Smith Genie's face to be more like the tweet.\n\n", "created_utc": 1549960092.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "egalwpa", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_apouv5", "parent_id": "t1_ega64yp", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/apouv5/imo_disney_messed_up_by_putting_will_smiths_face/egalwpa/", "score": 348, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "express_sushi49", "author_id": "cmh55", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "How you do it : Thanos.
