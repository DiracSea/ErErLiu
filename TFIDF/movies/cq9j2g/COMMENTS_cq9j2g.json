Being a Lovecraft fan, I don\u2019t have particularly high expectations, as previous attempts have failed miserably. Lovecraft\u2019s mythos is almost impossible to properly bring to the visual medium. For example, with this story, it\u2019s involves a color outside the spectrum of our Universe. His mythos is very vague and unclear. Characters usually end up going insane, either by merely just looking at the being or going crazy by thinking about it over and over nonstop. Also, cosmic horror isn\u2019t just about what to see or not see from out elsewhere in the Universe, it\u2019s existential. For example, here\u2019s the opening of *The Call of Cthulhu*, \u201cThe most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.\u201d \n\nYou can\u2019t properly portray that on-screen.

The problem with visually depicting any of Lovecraft's stories is that the very nature of the elements of his stories that people want to see most *can't* be seen this side of madness. It's likely something that they aren't even being detected entirely by the eyes, but at least partially by the mind directly.\n\nThe Color out of Space isn't violet. It's something that can't possibly be caught on film. This might work if it was a faux documentary or found footage movie where they express frustration that the film isn't really capturing the color correctly. But without that extra layer of detachment, the audience will assume they're really seeing the Color. Which they certainly aren't.\n\nSame thing with Cthulhu. People love depicting him as a winged anthropoid with tentacles where the mouth goes. But seeing Cthulhu is to go mad. No human can really see the Old One and keep his sanity, which means first person descriptions are definitely made by unreliable narrators.\n\nI'm torn, because I *really* do want to see these stories brought to life.
