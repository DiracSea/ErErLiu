TV movies are banned. The Oscars, Cannes, etc are for cinema released films, or films that intend on having cinema releases. Amazon has had academy award nominations (manchester by the sea, The Big Sick).  Netflix is trying to change the rules and nobody wants to accommodate them. \n\nHere are the other problems in this article\n\n>Many small indie films get a brief, limited release in a handful of theaters in New York and LA to qualify for Oscar consideration\n\nWrong. I live in a mid size city and we get them here. Every major city should get the bulk of notable indie releases. If not by the end of the year, sometime in mid winter. \n\n>They wind up created primarily as award-season creations not really intended to even earn much box office or viewership, instead justifying their existence as art for its own sake\n\nBut...they do all make money. Not blockbuster amounts, but a lot of these small indie films make several million dollars if they are getting good press and word of mouth\n\n>People booed the Netflix film Okja at Cannes last year\n\nPeople boo all sorts of things at cannes. Its a snotty french thing\n\n>Cannes now bans Netflix and Amazon films from competion\n\nNo. They ban films that dont get released in French theaters. Its a business choice to protect the french cinema industry, which is very important to the people in it. \n\n>Spielberg for example surely knows the pain of such blind rejection and dismissal of his work as \"true film\" as opposed to \"popcorn entertainment\" or \"movies, not films.\" \n\nNumerous academy award nominations, routinely touted as the best living American Filmmaker, hasnt had that reputation in ages. Oh, Im sure he is hurting over it. \n\n>Christopher Nolan spent years waiting for awards recognition for his work because it often wasn't taken seriously due to falling into certain genre categories, or -- in some of the most offensive treatment of an artist for reasons entirely unrelated to their specific work or personal behavior -- due to pure resentment toward Nolan due to the way his fanbase treated critics or awards groups\n\nWhat work of his deserved an academy award and didnt get nominated?  The Dark Knight was snubbed, an era where the Academy would never have considered a genre film (snubbed when you consider the fucking reader got nominated over it), but I havent seen another film of his that I thought was likely for an award, until Dunkirk. \n\n>The only reason to block them in the first place is if there's a fear they will get nominated on merit.\n\nAs they have, fairly. When they play by the rules in place. Look at Amazon who has done very well with this. Big Sick ran in theaters for ages. Manchester by the Sea made 77 Million at the Box Office on a 8 million budget.  Its literally just netflix who is trying to pull a fast one by ignoring traditional release models. I would have loved to see the Meyerowitz Stories in theaters, but Netflix didnt want to go that route. Their business model doesnt hold up with theatrical releases. Thats fine. The Emmys and Golden Globes award TV movies, and in this era, there is no shame in being a TV movie. Which is what you are if you arent released in enough theaters to qualify for things like the Academy Awards.

Which is hugely antithetical to Cannes. \n\nAs for the idea that Netflix originals have the chance to be... original. I'm not convinced.\n\nOften with independent films, they get made by a production company and then they are picked up by a distributor. So something like Manchester by the Sea wasn't actually made by Amazon and it makes no difference to the creative process of the film. \n\nAnd one of the most successful films put out by Netflix so far has been Bright. Which is just as unimaginative as anything made by big Hollywood studios.\n\nI have no reason to believe that Netflix is going to start making experimental films or that it will have a significant impact on how independent films are made in the future. \n\nMaybe film makers will be less worried about pulling punters in if they know it will be going directly to a streaming platform. But I just don't see that factoring hugely into the creative process. \n\nWhat I could see happening is a new mini-series/film hybrid appearing, and more anthology series happening. As well as people caring less about making feature length films because why does a film need to be 90 minutes+ if it's a streaming service? \n\n", "created_utc": 1522164653.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dwd81bv", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_87ienr", "parent_id": "t3_87ienr", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/87ienr/banning_netflix_amazon_from_festivals_and_awards/dwd81bv/", "score": 225, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "KingOfCubicles", "author_id": "csaki3t", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "No it's not.

I think there are a few different points to make about this subject.\n\nThe first point is I don't view Netflix and Amazon as equal players in this discussion. Amazon has more or less embraced the idea of releasing their movies in theatre before releasing them on their streaming platform. Both The Big Sick and Manchester By the Sea were allowed to be seen on the big screen because of this.\n\nOn the other hand, Netflix has had a completely opposite take when it comes to releasing their movies in theatres. They want to make their movies available for streaming at the same time as they are available in theatres. For obvious reasons this is a problem for theatre operators. It might be a different issue if Netflix put those movies on a pay-per-view release for streaming, but that isn't the case. The movies are available to stream for free at the same time they would be in the theatre.\n\nAnother issue is that while the overall box office has been growing, that is mostly coming from the top of the charts - the blockbusters. The majority of other movies are seeing increasingly small audiences in theatres, in part because of the perception they movie is worth waiting a few months to watch it at home. \n\nThese conversations criticizing movie theatres for trying to protect their business from streaming services are very short sighted. Most theatres survive on very small margins - especially after paying hundreds of thousands of dollars in the last 7-8 years to convert to digital systems. If you take too much away from what theatres can make, then there is a serious risk of losing movie theatres - especially in small towns. \n\nWhile there may be debate about seeing the latest drama or romcom on the big screen vs at home, I think most agree that the latest Jurassic World, Avengers, or Star Wars needs to be seen on the big screen. However if we cut away too much from theatres then we may lose the option to see these movies in theatres. \n\nDecisions to ban streaming services from film festivals is an attempt to ensure we continue to have the option to see movies on the big screen as they were intended. I don't think it's too much to ask for Netflix and Amazon to agree to release their movies in theatres exclusively for a period if they want to participate in film festivals with studios who are doing theatrical releases.

Cannes did this because the movies awarded are suppose to be films developed for the big screen and they view streaming movies as being more like TV movies than feature films. TV movies haven't been given these awards in the past, they have their own awards. Some movies have kind of gotten around this by having \"Theatrical Releases\" in a very small number of theaters that only last for a couple weeks, but most don't even get a theatrical release at all. This is causing problems in the feature film industry and may kill the already struggling theater industry, which Cannes see as a vital component of \"Cinema\" (& I agree). Cannes' goal in doing this is to force Netflix and others to either have true theatrical releases or compete for TV movie awards. Basically, they need to choose a lane. Also, Cannes only requires they show the movies in French Cinemas so its not some global studio powerplay like others have suggested. \n\nSome of the sauce: http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/netflix-films-no-longer-compete-cannes-film-festival-article-1.3894935", "created_utc": 1522175091.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dwdjtl0", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_87ienr", "parent_id": "t3_87ienr", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/87ienr/banning_netflix_amazon_from_festivals_and_awards/dwdjtl0/", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "DeusEntitatem", "author_id": "j1bjw", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Further proof that the Hollywood award circuit is a giant circle jerk", "created_utc": 1522175775.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dwdklgp", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_87ienr", "parent_id": "t3_87ienr", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/87ienr/banning_netflix_amazon_from_festivals_and_awards/dwdklgp/", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "medicmongo", "author_id": "xvtvq", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Over 50% of the country already thinks the Oscars, the Golden Globes, and the majority of film festivals are a pretentious joke.

And let's be frank the movies in the Official Selection were always by the biggest names in Cinema, no movie on the official selection was ever, ever going to struggle to find a distributor.\n\nCannes have one of the biggest film market in the world, this is where movies find distributors. They also have a competition for smaller directors called \"Un Certain Regard\" where indeed most of the movies can totally use the exposition. Those things are separated from the Official Selection.\n\nThe reality of the situation as to why Cannes now requires movies to pledge to a theatrical distribution is because of the massive backlash by the CNC (National Center of Cinema, that collects money on every ticket sold), big theatre chains owned by asshole billionaires like the Seydoux family and private french channel Canal +, owned by asshole billionaire Vincent Bollore. \n\nYou need to understand that they push to preserve a legislation called the \"chronology of medias\", meaning that if a movie gets a theatrical release it can not appear on a streaming service such as Netflix less than 3 years later. So if Netflix gave their 2017 movie Okja a theatrical release, they could not have their own movie on their own service before 2020.\n\nWhat you need to understand is that private channel Canal + gets a special deal allowing them to show movies a few months after they got released on video, for example they currently have Logan programmed on their channel. Netflix or Amazon Prime could not have Logan before 2020.\n\nCanal + and the CNC spend a lot of money to make sure the law do not change. Canal + would become virtually worthless overnight if Netflix could have movies as recent as Canal + does. As for the CNC if Netflix movies gets released in cinemas that means millions of ticket sales and millions of euros in their cash register. French legislation have a very nasty habit of throttling and limiting new services and technology in order to protect dying old ones. Not that Cinemas will ever die in France, we are one of the most avid moviegoers in the world, but Canal + and Satellite channels on the other hand can only stay competitive if Netflix is forced to be shit. (I should point out that Netflix do gives 2% of their revenue to the CNC, which apparently is not enough for them)\n\nIf Cannes allowed Netflix movies, the CNC and french theatres threatened to boycott Cannes selected movies in return.

They exist to represent the little people, the individual artists, creating the movies we love, and especially in the entertainment industry, where there's so much demand for the jobs, without the unions those people would be getting stepped on seven days a week and twice on Sunday (and no, when I say \"little people\", I don't mean Spielberg and Nolan,  although people like them have also been huge beneficiaries of the union contracts that protect them). \n\nI mean, ahem, yes, streaming services should totally be allowed in awards ceremonies, but just saying they're not above reproach, and this issue, like many, isn't as simple as this dude makes it out to be.", "created_utc": 1522170145.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dwde6my", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_87ienr", "parent_id": "t1_dwd63d9", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/87ienr/banning_netflix_amazon_from_festivals_and_awards/dwde6my/", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "PigAndJim", "author_id": "haj3f", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "It's honestly both frightening and amazing how much of a base of support Netflix has built for itself.
