He made more money in a year than he had made in his entire life. This was real estate circa 2007... you can guess what happened to his real estate business after that - it tanked. \n\nWell, the judge looked at the history and decided that he could get lucky again. He ordered him to make $400,000 a year and set the alimony according to that figure (I'm simplifying here, but that's the basics).\n\nThe rest of the story is way too long to tell how it resolved, but I will say that my dad was held in contempt and went to jail before it was resolved. \n\nAnd contrary to what the guy says below, courts rarely adjust alimony down. They will adjust it up quite readily if the wife gets wind the husband is making more money now. \n\nEdit: For the record, it amazes me that it is legal to order someone to earn a certain amount of money per year. I don't know how that doesn't qualify as indentured servitude, but that is exactly what it is. You don't want to work? Too bad, you will work or you will sit in jail.

There probably isn't a legal rationale in all honesty. What happens is that the judge wants the ex wife to get her alimony, and judges can basically do whatever they want because there is a built in mechanism to make sure none of his specious orders get appealed. \n\nHere is an article talking about it. \n\nhttp://abcnews.go.com/Business/2nd-wives-club-angry-tapped-alimony/story?id=9010118\n\nSomeone in the article says that it only happens when they go into contempt for non payment, but that doesn't make sense as there is no reason for the alimony to go up in such a scenario - how would raising it solve the problem?\n\nJudges are pretty shameless when it comes to making sure an ex wife gets paid. \n\nA judge held my dad in contempt of court for not paying the alimony, and his reasoning was that he could borrow the money from family and friends, and thus had the ability to pay.\n\nThat is definitely not legal, but in order to appeal that we would have had to let my dad sit in jail for the duration of the appeal, which could be a year or likely more. Thus, we came up with the money (as the judge knew we would) and then the judge gets to move on without any punishment for making a decision that was completely contrary to law and holding someone ransom to their family and friends. \n\nAnd that happens a lot. Judges often find people in contempt knowing that their friends and family will come up with the money so they don't sit in jail. And in every one of those cases, you lose the right to appeal as soon as the contempt ends. It is terrible.
