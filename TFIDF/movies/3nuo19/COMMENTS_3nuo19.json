Heroes was in their first season, and Lost was mysterious and we were still eager with hope for answers from the next episode.\n\nI could log on to NBC the next day, watch Heroes online. Maybe some Journeyman. Then one day I started getting messages saying I couldn't access it from my location. \n\nI could never watch the show live because I had class and work in the evening. And there were no DVD's or Bluerays out yet. And the Canadian Itunes store carried jack shit. Google play never existed, and I think Netflix still used DVD's. \n\nMy only legal means to participate in the media form, was now gone because of some random law that cared that I wasn't American. I was willing to watch all the ads, I was even interested in some of the products. \n\nI was now denied the right to participate in a cultural event. Thats like being a 90's kid and never being allowed to talk about POGS, or Pokemon cards, or gameboy. It's like being in social prison. Suddenly you are restricted from experiencing the world to its fullness with everyone else. \n\nIt sounds like I'm whining, and this is a first world problem, but lets hyperbolize for a moment. \n\nImagine if we did this with art:\n \n* You are not allowed to view a picasso, because you weren't born in the artists country. \n* You can't listen to Mozart, because you weren't born in his century. \n* You will not be allowed to view the moon landing because you aren't American like NASA.\n\nThere are somethings that just transcend a media and becomes a human experience. Can we live without these things, sure. Would you consider it right or fair to force someone to do so if others are allowed to experience it all? \n\nI like to think the answer to that is no.  You wouldn't force someone to live without a lightbulb at night. It wouldn't kill them to be in the dark, but it would be cruel to geolock access to technology and medicines that could make life better. \n\nCopyrights should exist to protect those who created works and media; no doubt. But only to the point where the copyright gives everyone some form of fair access and participation in the media. To Create works and then segregate an audience is the Cause of piracy. \n\nWe kind of Need a DMAA actually. Digital Millennium Audience Act.  To protect the rights of the Audience, and to prevent unfair segregation and isolation from culture due to the politics of trade agreements. \n\nIf I want to let a distribution company in New Zealand release a series or show in their region, so be it, but if they cannot equally match services like online streaming that other users gain access to freely, then the audience must be given unrestricted access to said online content without Geo locking. \n\nYou know common sense stuff. \n\ntl;dr\n\nI might have gone off on a tangent.

There is a reason for the landscape looking the way it does and it's not because between the thousands of execs in the film/tv industry not a single one of them is intelligent.\n\nDue to anti-trust regulations they can't. Studios are not allowed control distribution directly to the customers. This goes WAY back to the days when Paramount was sued by the United States Federal government for making the films, distributing the films, and exhibiting the films. Essentially controlling every step along the way and making competition next to impossible. Every Studio owned it's own theaters across the country. Thereby making only the top handful of rich studios capable of selling tickets to an audience. Not to mention an extremely fragmented and confusing landscape for film goers (although I think they were probably blissfully ignorant to that back then). If it wasn't for that ruling (in the 40s), we would have never gotten Scorsese or Aranofsky or Nolan. There would be no mini-majors like Lionsgate or Europa Corp or the Weinsteins. Movies like Mad Max: Fury Road would not have happened. Despite the WB logo on that film, it was produced and financed by another company, WB was in for part of the budget and the marketing. We'd be so mired in the studio system that there wouldn't be co-productions.  Every company would have it's own proprietary technology, third parties would not have innovated VFX and animation and a thousand other things at the same pace, so we'd probably have less advanced entertainment. \n\nI do think the landscape is so different today that digital distro of one's own content would be great, but unfortunately they can't. Not 'directly' anyway. A few of them own Hulu together. I think Epix is a Sony off shoot. Combine that with the studios (conglomerations beholden to shareholders) desire to find a way to replace the physical media sales that were evaporating with digital sales, and it all makes a ton of sense. If you have been selling things millions of items for $15 a pop, and then someone says, hey forget that just rent them for $5 a pop... I think you might have an aneurysm. Then if you did it without doing due diligence to find other money making alternatives, you get fired by the board of directors which in turn is getting squeezed by the shareholders.\n\nIt's easy to point fingers and say 'shoulda done this, shoulda done that'... but the shit isn't exactly simple and obvious.", "created_utc": 1444245244.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "cvrltji", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_3nuo19", "parent_id": "t1_cvrhr2p", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/3nuo19/paramount_pictures_has_launched_an_official/cvrltji/", "score": 202, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "MulderD", "author_id": "betcd", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "So I want to watch interstellar... no way to rent it anywhere... buy it for 15 bucks?

Like, yes, the movies are bad but they tend to be so unaware of the movie universes that their comments become nonsense at times. \n\nAlso, and I've timed it, Paul Scheer horribly ad libs about 12-15 minutes of ads each episode. He's just bad at it too. I always have to skip the first five minutes, five in the middle and five at the end. I actually listen to ads on other podcasts because the hosts are funny and make them entertaining. Paul Scheer is just painful to listen to when he's alone.  Also, the editing is really bad.  The commercials are often cut in mid-sentence during discussions with no warning.  For the people involved the podcast is extremely amateurish.  It has it's moments but The Flophouse is certainly superior to HDTGM in all respects.

There is so much overhead in the business that'll have to change. You have your major-label A&R guy making $500k a year. But three acts you signed for $1mil aren't breaking even. Touring revenue isn't what it once was, you can take a piece of it, but the big artists that could make you money there can command better deals so labels see less. Smaller labels now can barely stay afloat, generally from trustfunds or a rich guy who wants to dabble. Or they're being gobbled up by VCs.\n\nThere's just going to be a shift. Some say for streaming to truly work out and be viable, it actually needs to be cheaper so it attracts more people. Spotify now is $10 a month, if you get that down to $5, in theory, you could get more people. 3 people at $5/mo is more money than 1 at $10/mo. I don't think that's gonna work.
