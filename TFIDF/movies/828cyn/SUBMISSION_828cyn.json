John Boyega here, and I\u2019m excited to chat with the Reddit community.\n \nI\u2019m an actor (and producer) from the United Kingdom. You may know me from Joe Cornish\u2019s cult sci-fi film Attack the Block, though I recently tried to save the galaxy in Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Star Wars: The Last Jedi. I also had the pleasure of working with Kathryn Bigelow in Detroit. \n \nI\u2019m currently traveling around the globe with our awesome cast from Pacific Rim Uprising, which I star in and produced. We\u2019re excited for you to see it in theaters March 23.
