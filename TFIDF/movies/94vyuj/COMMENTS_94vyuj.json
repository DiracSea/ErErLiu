Exposure to content sensationalist, click-baiting, low-quality created by people like the Paul brothers and the like is not good at all. It is not how people act in the real world, and I'm worried exposing children to this kind of thing before they can even write will have a negative long-term effect.

My 10 year-old brother actually thought (and still somewhat thinks) that it is impossible to learn any skill without YouTube. Not that it's difficult. That one *literally* cannot learn to draw without YouTube tutorials. Having that conversation with him was the point at which I realized just how bad the problem actually may be.
