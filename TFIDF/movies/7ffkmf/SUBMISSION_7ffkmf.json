I can't think of any other film like it. First it's an excellent and loving parody to Star Trek. Second, it's actually a great science fiction adventure film with a good plot. The comedy is great, but the dramatic moments are just as impact. The part where Tim Allen has to explain to Balthzar that they are actors is heartbreaking. Everyone involved with the film seemed to totally understand and buy into what they were making. I can't think of another film that blends the line between parody and drama so flawlessly. Space Balls for example is a great parody, but has no serious sci-fi elements. \n\nEDIT: When I thought about it, maybe Ghostbusters is the best comparison. It's not a parody in any way, but it blends the line between comedy and it's horror elements perfectly. \n\nEdit 2: wow I didn't expect this to blow up. Here is an excellent spoiler analysis from one of my favorite youtube channels. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/TVG0va5mNVM\n\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "title": "Galaxy Quest is still one of a kind.
