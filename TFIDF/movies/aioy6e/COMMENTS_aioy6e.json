He was never pictured as being a bright kid in any way, and was supposedly traumatised by his actions when during the questioning he asked the police 'Have the hospital made [james] alive again?'  \nMeanwhile, Venables came from a respectable family background and was supposedly a rather smart kid, with no history of abuse whatsoever. The fact that he regularly boasted about his actions after the event without showing any remorse, leading to him having to be moved detention centres on multiple occasions due to the beatings other kids gave him when he did so, imply that he was faking the remorse to the investigators to manipulate them. Even after his release in 2001, he had to have his identity changed a number of times due to boasting about who he was to other people, while Thompson is supposedly in a long term relationship with someone who knows about his past, and is continually monitored and reported to be truly sorry.  \n\nI don't mean to imply that you and /u/drmcsinister are wrong, as there is too little information publicly available either way, though even back when it first happened I was always harrowed by Venables more than Thompson.", "created_utc": 1548195001.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "eeq1qqz", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_aioy6e", "parent_id": "t1_eepzbn2", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/aioy6e/mother_of_murdered_toddler_james_bulger_is/eeq1qqz/", "score": 167, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "tea-man", "author_id": "3qr22", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "More likely that Venables was far more capable of manipulating adults and authority figures while Thompson was not.
