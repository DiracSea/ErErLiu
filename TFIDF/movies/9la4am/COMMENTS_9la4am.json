However he really liked Andre. Here's the key passage.\n\n> Wallace Shawn: You know, there\u2019s not too much to say about it. I suppose my agent did something unusual in telling me who they really wanted. And telling me that I was the third choice. I was very, very aware that I was not the first or second choice. I mean, ordinarily, agents don\u2019t do that, and I must admit in my case, it did make it hard for me. Because I didn\u2019t get the sense of humor, really, didn\u2019t understand it very well. It\u2019s not my type of humor, so the director had to kind of coach me through everything I did.\n\nIt\u2019s by far what I\u2019m best known for on planet Earth. No day goes by without someone commenting on it to me. It turned out to be one of the most beloved films. People had the most astonishing response to it. Apparently by following Rob Reiner, by trying to imitate him\u2014he would do [my lines], and then I would imitate him. And I must have done it adequately, as people compliment me on it on a daily basis.\n> \n> INTERVIEWER: What was it like acting opposite Andre The Giant?\n> \n> WS: Well, that, I did very much enjoy. He was marvelous. But there was something painful about his situation, because he already had lost some of his strength. Of course it was well-known that he could not live terribly long, because no one with his condition did. So it was all a bit poignant. But he was always very, very intelligent, and he was very kind to me, because I was quite afraid of certain things we had to do, and he was very, very nice to me. He was a fascinating person, because he had come from a small village in France and wanted to travel.

The condition is responsible for Big Show\u2019s immensity just as it was for Andre\u2019s. The difference is that Big Show stopped the progress of his acromegaly with a successful surgery on his pituitary gland in the early 1990s.\n> \n> In 2011\u2019s WWE \u2018Beyond The Ring\u2019 release, Big Show: A Giant\u2019s World, Show opened up about his condition:\n> \u201cI figure I was about nine when I developed a tumor on my pituitary gland. It\u2019s referred to as acromegaly. I think the statistic is that there are 177 seven-foot kids that graduate from high school each year. I was 6\u20192\u201d at twelve. I really started to get freakishly big at fourteen when I was like 6\u20198\u201d. I was just a machine. I ate about 14,000 calories a day. It was nothing for me in high school to eat four Big Mac\u2019s, two fish sandwiches, two large fries and a large shake and twenty minutes later play a basketball game like nothing was wrong. I was dunking a basketball in eighth grade [and reached 7\u20190\u201d tall in high school].\u201d\n> \n> Big Show continues, \u201cI realized when I was a freshman in college that I had giantism. It really hit me right in the stomach hard, because I always thought I was just blessed. I never thought of it as an abnormality. I just thought I was just gifted with all this. As a young kid, I didn\u2019t know. I just thought I was just stronger than all the other kids.\u201d\n> \n> Being 7-foot even, the Big Show has a tendency to be an imposing presence. To counter his incredible immensity compared to everyone else, Show has an infectious sense of humor. This is one way he has said to cope with people\u2019s first impression of him. He often does impressions of other wrestlers backstage (on screen as well!) and it was his comedy skills which helped him move into acting. In 2010, he starred in the film Knucklehead.

The rocks first few movies were....Well let's just say he's come a really long way. \n\nPerforming isn't the same thing as convincing acting.

There's a reason a reason they tend to pursue large typically comedic roles in blockbuster movies rather than a  say an Oscar bait. \n\nA lot to screen actors can't do theater well and vice versa. Same with comedians. \n\nI'm not trying to disparage wrestlers or the fact they are just highly athletic performers and not athletes. Im just saying that I wouldn't really call it acting in any traditional sense. I think it's more like hosting and as we've seen from plenty of awards shows there are tons of really good actors who just fall flat ton their face in those kind of performances.\n\nSuper different beasts. It's impossible to say which is \"harder\" cause it depends on the person. I'm sure Cena is much more comfortable and confident as a wrestler than an actor.

I jumped into my car and rushed to the hospital only to meet the rest of my family in the hallway trying to pick up my sister and carry her out the hospital. He had developed blood clot in his leg because the hospital did not put those pressure cuffs on his legs. The clot broke loose and went in to his lungs.

I'm glad to know that, I've been worried about him in the back of my mind for years. I don't follow wrassling either but I know what a nice guy he is through the other stuff he does like The Rock or Cena.\n\nWrassling may be the second dumbest thing in the world but nobody can deny that the people involved in it do some good.

Luckily my parents just had boys, so Olsenmania didn't really reach our household, but my cousins were girls and were totally into it. They had tons of merch, those detective tapes, watched Full House like it was a religion, etc.\n\nMy dad saw this stuff and asked them: \"Where's the third one?\". \"There's only two, they're twins\". \"Don't be silly, there's three. Mary, Kate, and Ashley.\"\n\nAnd in the grand tradition of dad jokes, he fully committed to this bit. For at least a year or two, whenever we'd visit our cousins and the Olsens were on (and the Olsens *would* be on), he'd swear that he could tell whenever they swapped. \"That's Mary...and that's Kate!\". And he concocted this whole plausible sounding (if you're a kid) theory that they used triplets so that one of them could always be resting for child labor purposes (which is the real reason they used twins), but that they legally had to give them all a screen credit, hence why Mary-Kate had two names. My cousins were tearing their hair out in frustration, and eventually stopped playing those tapes whenever we came over (thanks dad!) to avoid the issue.\n\nMuch time passes, and at some point in the 2000s we're having Thanksgiving dinner. During the conversation, one of my cousins mentions how infuriating that whole bit was, and asked my dad if he still insisted there were three Olsen twins. \"No, there are four. Mary, Kate, Ash, and Lee\". He must have been waiting for years to deliver that punchline.\n\nUltimate dad joke.", "created_utc": 1538655923.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1538657305.0, "id": "e75bwwh", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_9la4am", "parent_id": "t1_e759tgj", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/9la4am/the_movie_the_princess_bride_meant_so_much_to/e75bwwh/", "score": 168, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "LupinThe8th", "author_id": "d4yn1", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "And scored by Flying Lotus, director of the trippy-ass hip-hop music scene.", "created_utc": 1538659364.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e75f0z7", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_9la4am", "parent_id": "t1_e75difn", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/9la4am/the_movie_the_princess_bride_meant_so_much_to/e75f0z7/", "score": 8, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Clayh5", "author_id": "9gzfm", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "His mania is not confined to the ring.", "created_utc": 1538663950.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e75k059", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_9la4am", "parent_id": "t1_e75h8al", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/9la4am/the_movie_the_princess_bride_meant_so_much_to/e75k059/", "score": 9, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "leroylson", "author_id": "hpyrh", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Probably also correct.
