(At last report, there are 11,000 members in this suit)  I worked at Dreamworks for nearly a decade so I am covered in the time period for which this lawsuit addresses.   \n\nThe case itself is very clear on an evidence-standpoint.  Ed Catmull, the head of Pixar, made several published public statements not only admitting to but bragging and justifying this illegal practice of colluding with these top studio execs to not hire from each other's labor pool in order to suppress wages and suppress worker mobility.\nHere is a good source that outlines the scheme and the broad reach that affected workers within animation but also beyond the entertainment industry and all the way to high tech industries:\nhttps://www.cartoonbrew.com/business/ed-catmull-on-wage-fixing-i-dont-apologize-for-this-105855.html\n\n\nI do know of people who were surprised that despite talent and achievement, were not processed through a hiring process.  Dreamworks and Disney are about 5 minutes from each other in Glendale and Burbank.  \n\nWhat these top execs did is a morally evil thing.  They acted in full knowledge that they were violating federal anti-trust laws.  They did it deliberately to save money and by fucking over their own artists who poured their passion, their best years of their lives, to give their best effort to put out great work.  \n\nWhile the timeframe of the lawsuit covers approximately 6-7 years, the lawsuit is an offshoot of the even larger \"High Tech lawsuit\" where Google, Apple, and other high tech silicon valley companies did the exact same thing (Remember, Steve Jobs ran Pixar for some time).  This made this lawsuit a lot easier for the plaintiff lawyers to pursue in court. This is why the plaintiff attorney fees were reduced to $18M by the judge after they had initially asked for over $38M.  The bulk of the legal groundwork had already been laid down so they didn't have to do as much work to present their case.\n\nThis is nothing less than wage theft.  Worse - career theft.  People never got to enjoy their full opportunity because of this cartel controlling things like an unbelievable conspiracy theory.  These companies are settling for what seems like a huge amount of money but it is still just a fraction of what they likely saved by implementing this covert, illegal scheme of unifying against the workers.\n\nThe animation artists at Disney and Dreamworks had a labor union (Local 839a, Animation Guild) yet that did not help because this pattern of corporate malfeasance was done covertly.  Sony, Blue Sky, Pixar are not union shops so they were probably even more screwed over by a variety of other practices beyond this particular one.\n\nIt's a really fucked up situation when talented artists are screwed over for a decade.  That's a whole career for some.  It was for me.\n\nI came from a videogame 3D art background and put a few years in digital visual effects before moving onto feature animation.  The people I worked with were great and dedicated.  \n\nToday Dreamworks sold out to Comcast and they laid off most of its USA artists in favor of offshored labor in China and India.  American animation (and our friends in VFX) gets beaten up by unethical executives all the time with no real consequences.

(None of the below excuses ripping of artists, because I've been ripped off before).\n\n\n- a) In my experience top artists can often be an issue. They work late hours with no pushback and enforce that as a rule to others, particularly juniors, until its essentially just an obligation and goes without saying. Its not unusual, even in crunch for most artists to stay back till 8 or 9 oclock every night *even* if their workload does not demand it. Its a cultural thing where everyone wants to look most dedicated.\n\n\n- b) Top artists are often paid an extraordinary amount (usually deserved), but this usually means at the bottom end interns and juniors are paid garbage salaries. I was in a top studio for 1.5 years on *half* the minimum wage, while a few top artists had lighter workloads, openly took their time with shots and accepted a salary nearly 4 times mine (*EDIT - I estimate the rough 'minimum wage' as a low-paid CG artist here*). Is their some obligation on keeping top artists salaries reasonable, to also keep junior wages reasonable? (Should note - I'm not suggesting this would naturally happen of course). The last 2-3 years of work I was paid triple figure salaries and that's all I needed, and felt I deserved (this is hastily worded, but you get the general jist). \n\n\n- c) Movies are fucked. We dont *need* VFX. Movies have existed for decades without any overt VFX and hold up significantly better. This public need for VFX blockbusters is absurd - every month a new superhero movie comes out with some garrish action scene that you forget in a second, that probably involved a thousand peoples full year work and 20 million dollars. I don't *need* a closeup on that tigers whiskers that takes a month to do. I don't need ten thousand background characters all photoreal. Can't directors/artists innovate anymore?

There was some leeway for both sides as a certain amount of hours of OT were set aside in the contract that the management could pull from and demand, but these were paid.\n\nb.  The salary differentials weren't really that weird because early on, there were few people who had the talent and expertise to perform all the necessary tasks - so the staffing was straightforward and the pay was pretty decent.  It's only when two things happened that pay levels became wildly variable:  First, art schools started graduating hundreds of CG artists in the mid 2000s.  This created a huge glut of \"ok\" artists that could be picked up for about 30-40% the pay we were getting.  Second, execs started looking to places like India then China to set up satellite studios where relatively well trained but inexperienced artists could perform some of the production work for 20% of the cost or less of an American artist.\n\nFrom then on, employers zeroed in on reducing wages as a goal.  This was triggered (in my analysis) by a couple of factors:\n- DVD sales stopped.  That was a major source of money that evaporated due to technological evolution toward streaming (whose monetization was not as lucrative)\n- Box office revenues were dropping\n\nso they looked to cut costs.\n\nUnfortunately I think that was the wrong place to cut.  It was like cutting muscle, not fat.  They got rid of talented people who really contributed to the quality of the product.  \n\nc) well, that's more of a philosophical debate and VFX has a place in movies but as I've said in some other posts, this lawsuit and this case does not deal with VFX.

He gets little above min wage and now has to walk 10 minutes to get to the factory. The production workers themselves have it worse.\n\nThis is why I'm glad VFX also includes a bit of programming, namely Python. And if you get into videogames you are dipping into C, C++, C#, and Java (assuming you aren't working at a big studio with a very specific job on the pipeline which is the vibe I'm getting from the thread). That makes you a bit more valuable, and at the very least gives you a backup plan: you can always go back to college and study CS and be a bit ahead with this background.\n\nSo my advice here would be: if you get into VFX, definitely go the extra mile to program your own tools into Maya, Blender, or whatever software, and learn you way around Unity or Unreal or Android development. You lose nothing. You can also get your hands on Houdini which is hands down the best VFX software out there for free if you use their student version, and you can learn how to use Python while procedurally generating assets.

The only way the management (I'm solely talking about Dreamworks here, not Disney or Pixar) would have NOT gone with offshore studios would be if our wages were reduced to equal that of the Chinese wages or Indian wages.  As long as we were even slightly more expensive, they would have laid us off like they did.  \n\nThey just happened to have saved some money prior to laying us off.\n\nEd Catmull's argument doesn't hold water for two reasons.  The first one, I just presented.  The second one:  Look at the enormous profits made by Pixar and Dreamworks and Blue Sky.  Frozen, Coco, Kung Fu Panda, Shrek, Madagascar, Ice AGe.  These movies made well above their production costs.  The actual cost of animators that worked on these movies is a tiny fraction of the cost.\n\nThe voice actors alone in the movies I worked on brought in several million dollars each.  The marketing costs of a movie was around $80M.   When you look at the cost structure of a movie, the cost of animators (and by animators, I mean the entire production crew) is small.  \n\nEd Catmull's focus on suppressing wages and reducing mobility is in my view more about keeping crews sequestered - more about restricting mobility.   He didn't want people bouncing from studio to studio.  He wanted to keep these teams stable and in one spot for easier management.\n\nWhen Shrek2 made something like $991M in box office gross and a shit ton more in DVD sales, the focus on trying to reduce the wages of production crews is completely ass backward.\n\nI just came up with a 3rd reason why this scheme was unsound.  It's kind of an obvious one but I have to say it.  It's illegal.  And it's illegal in a way that is also morally wrong.  This \"business decision\" was against the law for a good reason.  It hurts people.  It hurts families.  It robs people of the free opportunity they are promised to get.  Our government has pledged to uphold laws that prevent this sort of abuse from powerful bosses who group together to put pressure on the workers and distort market forces by manipulating the market by their sheer power.\n\nEd Catmull knew what he was doing.  He is surrounded by an army of execs and lawyers who know the legality of their company's policies.  And so they went forward with it anyway - knowing full well that it was wrong to do.  Someone probably said that the numbers would make it worthwhile even if they got caught.  The savings would outweigh these settlements - I have no doubt they do.\n\nI think that what Ed did is morally reprehensible and I condemn it.

I worked with a tenure professor and co founder of a VFX house to research the content, it won\u2019t be available publicly  but I would love to chime in. \n\nCompetition is a piece of it, yes, but I would argue government subsidized tax incentives play a bigger role. VFX houses are rather expensive investments as many of you know (servers, computers, office space, and labor...ooooh the labor). Studios can go chasing tax incentives because that\u2019s the fiscally responsible thing to do as someone writing the check; however, VFX houses with these long timeline bids can\u2019t up and move their offices every time a new city increases a rebate. I discovered that in some cases, between Vancouver\u2019s tax subsidy (~25%) and the exchange rate from US to Canada, there were times some studios could get as much as a 47% discount on the same services provided by a US house (like R&H). \n\nWhen you look at it from that macro perspective, it doesn\u2019t matter how good your operating model was you could not compete profitably with a studio located in a tax subsidized city. Example: let\u2019s say an LA based VFX shop bids $10M for work on Avengers 21, let\u2019s pretend that price = cost + margin for the VFX house to operate sustainably. Vancouver VFX company bids the same $10M, but the city of Vancouver will give the movie studio $2.5M back as a tax rebate. So for the US VFX house to even have a chance at getting the work, they have to start their bid at $7.5M. Goodbye margin, hello \u2018let\u2019s just keep people employed and the lights on\u2019 mentality. \n\nThese tax incentives are meant to encourage development of an industry in a given area, but they are highly inconsistent. The tax plans have a significant amount of variance, and as some states have shown in the past they don\u2019t always last or bring the type of long term industry development hoped for. \n\nEdit: Massachusetts offers a competitive tax incentive, we see a string of Boston movies (all of Adam Sandler\u2019s grown up series, Ted 1 & Ted 2, the equalizer, black mass, even American hustle which takes place in Ny was shot mostly outside Boston), but the benefits have been widely debated (article from 2014): http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2014/09/18/cost-film-tax-credit-per-mass-job/LGHOSjvkPrfwMyK4xYS79N/story.html\n\nPoint is without a plan, a timeline to offer, or more strategic regulation, studios just look around frantically for the best price and VFX ends up being treated like a commodity. Cities have the budgets and power to alter the competitive landscape more than studios or VFX companies combined, and for them it can be easily tucked under the \u201ccreating more jobs\u201d slogan, but feels more just like relocating the same jobs when your employer says either move to Vancouver with your family or find a new job. \n\nEdit: removed anecdote, updated for clarity, and typos ", "created_utc": 1530253698.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1538950827.0, "id": "e1hhf9u", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8uo0rr", "parent_id": "t1_e1hc2n0", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8uo0rr/animation_workers_set_to_receive_170_million/e1hhf9u/", "score": 283, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "2DNeil", "author_id": "hhcxq", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I mean you could have a pact to no go under a certain price.
