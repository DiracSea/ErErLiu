Not just *that* they like something or rate it highly/badly in a category, but **why** they hold that opinion.\n\nThe Oscars simply don't have the time to do that. Hell, they apparently now don't even have the time to give all the awards onscreen.\n\nIn an age where you can go watch endless hours of scene-by-scene analysis of movies, it's suddenly much harder to trust the judgements of a cadre of people who meet behind closed doors and don't deign to reveal to the unwashed masses the reasons why they chose to nominate/award certain films. If I'm watching an in-depth dissection of a film on youtube, I may disagree with the conclusions of the reviewer, or they may point out something interesting the movie did that I didn't notice watching it myself that makes it truly great. That's not the case with the Oscars.\n\nTheoretically, you could make the Oscars a multi-medium event where the various voters/panelists break down what they thought was superlative about the films they nominated and voted for, and host those videos or essays online.\n\nBut that's the only way I can really see the award ceremony changing to fit the times.", "created_utc": 1550130958.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "egg1029", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_aqf159", "parent_id": "t1_egfoyel", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/aqf159/scorsese_tarantino_deakins_other_filmmakers_call/egg1029/", "score": 96, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "SomeOtherTroper", "author_id": "60kw0", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "We have the internet now, so it's easy to skip the show and watch the highlights the next day on Twitter. For example, the Moonlight/LaLaLand fiasco was trending all over the internet the next day. You didn't have to sit through 4 hours just to watch it.\n\nAlso, the show cares less and less about celebrating the art of movie making. They used to have little clips that would show why each movie was nominated. For example, sound mixing... they'd show a 5 second clip for each movie about the sound mixers working in the studio with a 5 second clip of their final work. THAT was cool. Lately they've cut that stuff out and just name the 5 nominees without any sense of what they've accomplished.\n\nAlso... people are realizing that winners don't win based on merit. There's the campaigning (the reason Harvey Weinstein had so many awards in the past), the politics (probably why Rami Malek will win - because of having to work with Bryan Singer), the \"are they due?\" award (Glenn Close this year), the \"will they have a chance to be nominated again?\" (probably why Bradley Cooper and Amy Adams won't win), etc. Rarely do the \"best\" (even though that's subjective) win. Just look at the best picture nominees... some of those just aren't in the same league as the others. And if you don't believe me, just listen to some of the \"Oscar experts\" who are trying to predict the outcomes. All their reasoning for their picks are based off the things I listed above (e.g. they're saying Sam Elliott *might* win for A Star is Born just so that the academy will give something to the movie other than the original song Oscar... why are they arbitrarily picking Supporting Actor? Because it's a \"weak category\" they said, and the academy can afford to give one out to a veteran like Elliott, even though it has no basis on his performance. They also mentioned \"he might not have another chance\"). All of this (along with our ability now to look up who won the SAG, BAFTA, etc) makes finding out the winners extremely predictable and aggravating.\n\nAll of these things combined just make it seem like a giant phony advertisement cash-grab. The awards don't really mean much and the show is becoming less and less entertaining.\n\nI know musical performances aren't popular in this thread, but the specific best song performances were always my favorite part of the show and they've been shortening them and cutting them altogether over the past few years. I also loved the way they'd cleverly introduce nominees with behind the scenes footage, but once they cut those I personally didn't find much reason to tune in anymore.\n\nedit: One more thing. It seemed like almost every year the host would make a joke about how long and boring the show was (little quips like \"Only three hours in, only three to go\", or \"almost there, folks, just keep hanging on\"). They treat the show like  a chore we have to endure and not only did I start believing them but they became a self-fulfilling prophesy.\n\nedit 2: TV has largely eclipsed movies over the past decade, so a lot of people have switched from watching movies to Netflix and Amazon Prime for high quality content. This causes a lot of people to not know any of the movies that are nominated. The lack of cable also affects the ability to watch it. The people who would just tune in because there was nothing else to watch probably won't go out of their way to find a live stream.\n\nTL;DR: They don't celebrate the art of making movies (especially the ones that are nominated), awards are all based on who campaigns the best or who is \"due\", their quality in movie taste has fallen,  they've cut performances (or substituted meaningful ones for dumb joke ones), nowadays more people are watching TV than movies, the show self-references how boring it is all the time, celebrities aren't as elusive anymore because of social media. Also, people can just go on Twitter the next day and get all the info they need in 3 minutes rather than sitting through 4 hours.
