So the choice is either A) Don't have any popular female characters, or B) switch some of their existing characters and hope they get away with it or C) resurrect old characters and hope people care. \n\n[Look at this list](http://www.comichron.com/monthlycomicssales/2018/2018-01.html).\n\nBatman, x-men, TMNT, batman, x-men, Harley Quinn, Star Wars, batman. \n\nSo they're trying all 3. Gwenpool/The Wasp/etc are their most popular new ones, which are basically spinoffs or side characters for stuff they're already doing. But they're definitely looking at the possibility that they're not going to have many major female characters, which makes it harder for them to appeal to wide audiences. So they're trying everything.\n\nEdit: A lot of people are discussing what's popular. To me, if I ranked a list of superheroes by name recognition, you should be reasonably high.

The character proved so popular that MGM briefly considered developing a solo film around her. When that didn\u2019t pan out, producers decided to bring her back for the 2002 Bond film \u201cDie Another Day.\u201d Unfortunately, scheduling conflicts prevented Yeoh\u2019s return.\n\n> Word of a spin-off series involving Halle Berry\u2019s character Jinx from \u201cDie Another Day\u201d began circulating while the film was still in theaters. Rumors hinted at a planned winter release in 2004.\n\n> \u201cBond screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert Wade were hired to write the script and, though it was never officially announced, Stephen Frears was on board to direct,\u201d said Chris Wright. \u201cBut in late October of the following year, MGM pulled the plug.\u201d\n\n> Reasons for its cancellation remain unclear.\n\n> When news first broke, a spokesperson for Eon producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson claimed that \u201ccreative differences\u201d were involved. But Variety reported that MGM\u2019s decision to nix the film took the Eon team by surprise. In any event, no apparent effort was made to set the project up at another studio.\n\n> Perhaps Jinx simply wasn\u2019t dynamic enough to build a new franchise around? The character, a skilled NSA operative with a mean left hook, remains more memorable for her stylish orange bikini and Ursula Andress-like entrance than for her originality or depth.\n\n> \u201cNot a lot is known about the script itself,\u201d said Tom Sears. \u201cBut Purvis and Wade have suggested that their idea was to involve Jinx in a story that would\u2019ve been a lot less excessive than \u2018Die Another Day.\u2019\u201d\n\nhttps://variety.com/2015/film/news/james-bond-lost-007-films-alfred-hitchcock-halle-berry-1201624228/", "created_utc": 1538796074.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e7976yo", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_9lrt5d", "parent_id": "t1_e796773", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/9lrt5d/a_female_james_bond_never_confirms_executive/e7976yo/", "score": 24, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "rikkirikkiparmparm", "author_id": "xfuab", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Plus there's a few black superheroes who could hold their own movies.
