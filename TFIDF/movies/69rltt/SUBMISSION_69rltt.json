At 7:00, the trailers began. If I am remembering correctly, the trailers that played were Transformers, Spider Man, Thor, Wonder Woman, Valerian, The Mummy, Kingsman, and Star Wars. I may be forgetting one, but at least those 8 trailers played. Each trailer had this stupid screen afterwards reminding us to make sure we see it in their super awesome extreme mega-badass theater (whatever it's called).\n\nAfter the trailers, there was your usual couple of ads telling you to turn off your phone followed by an annoyingly lengthy ad telling us how great the theater is that we are currently sitting in, followed by one of those needlessly long sound test ads (I miss you THX), followed by a final ad telling everyone to enjoy the movie. Towards the end of all this, you could tell that the audience was getting impatient, and there were several audible sighs and other comments.\n\nWhen the little Marvel Studios animation started, I checked the time. 7:32. We had all just sat through 32 minutes of what are essentially ads. Now don't get me wrong, I love trailers and look forward to seeing a few, but 8+ trailers followed by like 5-10 minutes of extraneous advertising felt exhausting and ridiculous. Maybe I should stop watching the trailers when they show up here on Reddit? Maybe I should be one of those people and show up late to the movie? I'm not sure. I don't imagine every theater is the same experience, but I can assume most big theater chains have the same policy.\n\nAnyway, just wanted to rant a bit.\n\nEDIT: Just to address some common responses:\n\n * This was a Cinemark in Texas.\n * I like showing up early because I get all anxious about having a good seat. If I can buy reserved seating, I'll always pick that option.\n * 5 to 10 movie visits a year is probably too high an estimate for me. I always THINK I will go see a movie, and don't end up doing it. 3-5 visits a year is probably more accurate for me and even that is apparently more frequent than your average redditor. Could be worth a [strawpoll](http://www.strawpoll.me/12916839).\n\nEDIT 2: Added Kingsman to the trailer list. That was the 8th trailer I forgot about.\n\nFINAL EDIT: Fixed a typo. Also thanks to everyone for the discussion and participating in the poll. The results were somewhat expected, but it's still nice to see.\n", "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "title": "The time it takes for the movie to start is starting to feel ridiculous.", "url": null, "author_name": "My_Watch_Begins", "author_id": "atvsk", "subreddit_name": "movies", "upvote_ratio": 0.82}
