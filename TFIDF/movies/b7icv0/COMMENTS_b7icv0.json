Three horror movies in one night. I was seven years old. Honestly, I got through both Chucky and Jason fine. Chucky was creepy to look at, but I just thought he was cool. By Jason's turn I was probably dozing off or distracted by toys.\n\nThen Freddy got his shot. Yeeeaaaaah, that didn't go so well.

Most horror movie victims get out a single eek, Tina actually sounded like she was being murdered.\n\nSo now I desperately wanted to leave the room, but then I'd be upstairs alone. I had to tough it out so I could stay with the teenagers.
