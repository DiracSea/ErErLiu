Basically a \"let the finished product you didn't look at before speak for itself\" retribution moment to hit theaters worldwide.\n\n3) Netflix is already its own version of international distribution (even if movies don't always air in all available markets). So to give the award to a Netflix movie is basically giving it to a movie that already achieved the awards goal.\n\n**TL;DR** - It's not about the medium vs. the range. Anything Netflix submits is already in potential global distribution. The point of receiving a Cannes award is to find/get global distribution. So Netflix should be there to buy movies, not submit movies for awards and acclaim it doesn't need.\n\nMight not be 100% correct, or maybe there's some subjective assessment included, but at least their decision makes more sense in this aspect. \n\nAs per the beginning of the article, I have to disagree with Spielberg and his Oscar assessment.

I had to drive 2 hours away to find a cinema that had a subtitle screening for Black Panther. I paid 150% as much as a standard ticket to get the little device, and I had to go at 2pm on an Thursday....\n\nIf they want me to see it in cinemas, how about make sure cinemas more accessible? \n\nYeah, I totally understand how seeing it in the cinema changes the way the art is received. I can actually hear more in the cinema because the sound system is a) loud as fuck and vibrates the floor and b) usually set up optimally for that screening.\n\nI don't remember Thor Ragnarok having a sound track, I watched that at home on a standard 2:1 stereo with my fully hearing boyfriend. Meanwhile I went home and actually bought the soundtrack to black panther after seeing it in cinemas because I actually got a feel for it and the movie definitely felt richer as a result.\n\n\nBut the soundtrack doesn't tell a movie, and without the subtitles during dialogue scenes I'd have no clue what was going on.\n\nI love the stories, the visual, the characters and narrative choices, movies really are an art.\n\nBut it feels like an art form that is becoming increasingly more inaccessible to me, the more content we create the less work goes into distributing it as accessibly as possible. I remember when every DVD released in my country had to have subtitles, you were starved for content but the content you got was always accessible. Now, it will depend on the streaming service, the individual show, the individual content creator, etc. Some people even think that automatically generated captions are good enough for accessibility - they're not. \n\nAnd that's fine, I just have to accept there are some shows, movies etc that I'll never get to experience. But if I find a work around and manage to jerry rig a system so I can enjoy a new movie despite accessibility options, I don't feel like the artist gets to complain that I'm doing it wrong. \n\nAnd it's not just accessibility from a disability point of view, life commitments, finances, cinema proximity, it all effects how we are able to consume media \n\nI know I'll never get the full experience, and I've even had some friends who work in film and television tell me that unless the subtitles are a narrative choice, just having them on screen takes away from the visual art of movies - whatever, I'll watch it twice if the visuals are that important and the movie is that worth honouring as an art form.\n\nTell people the best way to enjoy your art, but then just let them have it.\n\nThat's the beauty and the sadness in art. At the time of creation it's deeply personal to the artist and he understands every nuance. But once it's published? It's the public's to enjoy and interpret as they see fit. Death of the author.\n\nYou may think the art conveys the artist's message best though cinema.\n\nBut if the audience gets the most pleasure from watching it on their iPhone, don't yuck their yum.
