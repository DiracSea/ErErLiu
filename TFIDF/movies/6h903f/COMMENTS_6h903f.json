That... is seriously disappointing. And people love quoting wikipedia, but not reading the entire article. She was part of Disney for about a *year* (1940) during the time in question, and it doesn't specify what her job was beyond \"art\". What she did do -- was go travel abroad with Walt. A few years later, she snagged a job as an art director (with Disney). It's her color design that drew Walt's attention (and that of the larger artistic community), primarily. It's a fortunate coincidence her artistic eye for color matched up nicely with the limitations of NTSC television and film of that era -- it gave Disney its signature coloring for a span of nearly five decades. I would conclude that it wasn't WWII that snagged her the position, but her personal relationship with Walt and going with him on his trip abroad. \n\n\nAll that said, it's pretty clear people have misinterpreted the letter somewhat -- while it is, indeed sexist -- it's not in the way people are thinking. Women have always exceled at fine-motor control -- they have smaller hands. And even to this day, there's a strong preference for women in assembly work that requires this. My mother worked on some of the circuitboards for the Minuteman missiles, at a time when we were manufacturing them like sausages under the threat of a nuclear war. Surface mount soldering to a copper mesh simply wasn't someone who had \"man hands\" could do quickly, reliably, and without making errors... and considering these circuits were for nuclear missiles, that's something that \"equality\" took a back seat on. What does this have to do with film?\n\n\nWell, literally, *film*. They had to trace out, frame by frame, the entire cartoon, on transparencies. The sketching/painting/character design was done on larger sketch pads (man hands!) but what they took a picture of and what became the actual 'cartoon' you see, was done on transparencies a little bigger than the length of your hand. \n\n\nSo the story here is that she didn't take no for an answer -- and just skipped over all the managers and befriended the owner, then went on a working vacation with him (as a person, not an employee), intent on catching Walt's eye. And she succeeded. WWII did change a lot of things, particularly regarding women in the workplace -- but that's not what landed her the job. She created that opportunity for herself. \n", "created_utc": 1497497166.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dix9iwg", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6h903f", "parent_id": "t1_dix23c5", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6h903f/disney_rejection_letter_to_a_woman_1938/dix9iwg/", "score": 9, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "MNGrrl", "author_id": "16xuh4", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "[deleted]", "created_utc": 1497510027.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dixggnj", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6h903f", "parent_id": "t1_dix49du", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6h903f/disney_rejection_letter_to_a_woman_1938/dixggnj/", "score": 15, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Ah, the \"Jessica\" of the 1900s.", "created_utc": 1497492548.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dix68ic", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6h903f", "parent_id": "t1_dix49du", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6h903f/disney_rejection_letter_to_a_woman_1938/dix68ic/", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "ScienceYouMonster", "author_id": "7zbju", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "For real.

A woman can also fight for her own freedom without having this sort of modern feminist understanding.\n\nEven when people are fighting the sexism of their society they can still internalize it. One of the quotes attributed to Caterina Sforza is one of my favorites: \"\"If I have to lose, although I am a woman, I want to lose in a manly way.\" Nowadays, if she's portrayed in film, she'll instead say something about how she and other women are the equal of any man, or men ruin everything with their egos, yadda yadda. At the time though, power was held a lot by men, and that sort of thing, which would seem sexist to a modern feminist, was empowering, to take on that male role, instead of deconstructing the idea that it is a male role at all. \n\nThis is why Cersei from the books is such a good character.

It's been far from easy sailing. It required a great deal of work, struggle, determination, competence, faith, and above all unselfishness. Some people think we have class distinction in the place. They wonder why some people get better seats in the theatre than others. They wonder why some men get spaces in the parking lot and others don't. I have always felt, and always will feel that the men that contribute most to the organization should, out of respect alone, enjoy some privileges. My first recommendation to the lot of you is this; put your own house in order, you can't accomplish a damn thing by sitting around and waiting to be told everything. If you're not progressing as you should, instead of grumbling and growling, do something about it.[5]\n\nDisney literally told his disgruntled employees to bootstrap themselves into better lives:\n\nMuch of the staff left the theatre infuriated and recruited even more employees to join the Screen Cartoonist's Guild. Meanwhile, tensions between Disney and Art Babbitt were reaching a peak when Babbitt became one of the union leaders which Walt saw as a personal betrayal. \"I don't care if you keep your god-damn nose glued to the board all day, or how much work you turn out...\" he told Babbitt in the hallway one day, \"if you don't stop organizing my employees, I'm going to throw you right the hell out of the front gate.\"[5]\n\nIn May 1941, Disney sent a letter of termination to Babbitt citing his cause \"union activities.\" This was the final spark that started the strike. The next day on May 29, 1941, more than 200 members of the studio staff had walked out on strike.[1][5]\n\nThe strike occurred during the making of the animated feature Dumbo, and a number of strikers are caricatured in the feature as clowns who go to \"hit the big boss for a raise\".[citation needed]\n\nDuring the strike, animators from other studios offered support for the strikers. Animators from Warner Bros., including Chuck Jones, volunteered their cars to form a motorcade around the Disney studio.[citation needed]\n\nThe strike lasted five weeks. Toward the end, Disney accepted a suggestion by Nelson Rockefeller, then head of the Latin American Affairs office in the State department, that he make a tour of Latin America as a goodwill ambassador, which would later result in the package films Saludos Amigos and The Three Caballeros. His removal from the scene enabled passions to cool, and in his absence the strike was settled with the help of a federal mediator, who found in the Guild's favor on every issue. The Disney studio signed a contract and has been a union shop ever since.[2]\n\n\n\"Following the strike, irreparable damage to the psychology and mood of the studio had, nevertheless, been done.
