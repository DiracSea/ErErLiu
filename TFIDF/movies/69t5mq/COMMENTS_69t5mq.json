The effects, cinematography, and dramatic pacing are always on point.\n\nHowever, I find the topics he chooses to be pretentious 'high concepts'. He chooses scenes and stories that sound good on paper but which have the subtlety of a freight truck crashing into a china shop, like this metaphor. So what happens is that you get a fantastically polished and extremely well edited piece of fluff. Aside from a few plotholes, some implausible concepts, and a narrative focused on developing those implausible concepts, all other aspects of Split are extremely well executed. The actors are easy to believe, the characters are fleshed out and relatable, the cinematography uses distance and angles really effectively to create suspense and empathy, and the score is fairly good. The plot has a clear increase in suspense followed by eventual resolution.\n\nLike Shamalan's other movies, Split is memorable and strikes a good balance between theatrical and naturalistic acting. The greatest weakness is that the plot is starved. There is no deep content to most of Shamalan's plots, and very little subtlety. But he still manages to make rivetting movies out of these poorly fleshed out plots, thanks to his great sense for the technical aspects of film. He's a weak writer but his directing skills are great.\n\n", "created_utc": 1494232912.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dh9zgr2", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_69t5mq", "parent_id": "t1_dh9lozi", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/69t5mq/m_night_shyamalans_latest_film_split_has_closed/dh9zgr2/", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "gHx4", "author_id": "uod9z", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "He isn't.

Night hatred for a moment. I, too, think he\u2019s become something of a joke. But he HAS made a number of worthwhile movies, and this is one I initially couldn\u2019t stand, thinking it was full of ridiculous plot-holes. And then\u2026EUREKA!\n\nWhen I first saw this film, I didn\u2019t realize that it wasn\u2019t about aliens at all. It\u2019s about the return of demons. Notice it\u2019s all about a priest\u2019s resurgence of belief, and a preordained moment of redemption-if-dared-and-attempted. There is no alien technology or weaponry or clothing of any kind, only a clawed, naked beast creature and lights in the sky.\n\nFurthermore: The running joke throughout the movie is that people see these \u201cinvaders\u201d in a way that\u2019s related to their particular frame of mind: The cop sees them as prankster kids, the bookstore owners see them as \u201ca hoax to sell commercials,\u201d the Army recruitment officer sees them as invading military, the kids see them as UFOs\u2026and the priest sees them as test of faith. This understanding of the film removed my hatred of the \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me; they were killed by WATER!\u201d concept. In fact, the priest\u2019s daughter had been referred to as \u201choly\u201d (as revealed during Mel\u2019s key monologue)\u2013recognized by all who saw her at her birth as \u201can Angel;\u201d and her quite particular relationship to water is shown to be very special and spiritual: In other words, she has placed vials of what are, essentially, HOLY WATER all around the house. (And the creature\u2019s reaction when coming in contact with this blessed liquid is EXACTLY like monsters/vampires being splashed by spiritual \u201cacid.\u201d)\n\nThis view of the movie also explains the creature\u2019s actions: They act like superior tricksters, are not able to break in through closed doors, can be trapped behind simple wooden latches \u2013all mythological elements of demons and vampire-like creatures of lore. It also explains the news over the radio at the end of the movie that an ancient method of killing the creatures has been found \u201cin three small cities in the Middle East\u201d \u2013one would suspect the religious \u201chubs\u201d of the three main Abrahamic traditions, each discovering the \u201cmystic methods\u201d of protection-and-dispatch that I\u2019ve noted earlier.\n\nNote also: All the Christian iconography throughout the movie, the references to \u201cSigns and Wonders\u201d (the true meaning of the title), the crucifix shapes hinted-at everywhere (check out the overhead shot, looking down on the street driving into town) and the ultimate fact that the entire movie is built around a Priest rediscovering he is not abandoned to a random, Godless, scientifically-oriented Universe but, rather, is part of a predicted and dreamed-of plan.\n\nNow \u2013these creatures may for all intents and purposes be some sort of extraterrestrial or inter-dimensional \u201caliens\u201d \u2013but the point of the movie seems to be that they are, in the ACTUALITY OF THE FILM WORLD, the dark stuff from which all the character\u2019s tales of devils and night-creatures were born.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ubaqq/what_fan_theories_have_blown_your_mind_with_their/c4ubvmy/", "created_utc": 1494204676.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dh9k6va", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_69t5mq", "parent_id": "t1_dh9ilpx", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/69t5mq/m_night_shyamalans_latest_film_split_has_closed/dh9k6va/", "score": 310, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I guess it's not really a twist but I always thought the fact that the kids asthma actually ended up saving him was the \"ohhh\" moment of the movie if that makes sense.
