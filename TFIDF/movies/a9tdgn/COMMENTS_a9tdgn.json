Cass, just as her reason for living, her daughter, was taken by a twisted form of life turned into something not quiet living, so was she, and was partly consumed by it.\n\nAll their deaths ran parallel with their history and character, and much of the film's themes explore the annihilation of ego, or being consumed by it, or the shadow-self, in the face of death.

If you've been in a dark place of depression or self-destruction, it's easy to lose days, weeks, or months.\n\n* Communication to the outside world is cut off. If you've been in a hole, you know it's tough for others to reach you and you to reach out.\n\n* Reality gets distorted. Events of the past and who you are get reflected in a way that is a mutation of reality. This could lead to seeing things horrifically but also can lead to seeing creative, beautiful things too - as Lena noted. (And why many artists have periods of self-destruction.) \n\n* There's a chance monsters (aka \"personal demons\") will tear you apart.\n\n* Some who enter the shimmer don't want answers and they don't want out. The fight is gone. They just want to fade out and disappear, like the physicist who gently becomes part of the landscape. This is a moving portrayal of depression and would guess this part hits some people very, very hard.\n\nFor those in the shimmer fighting to find the truth - or \"the light\" - many will die before they get there. (The soldier's bones outside the lighthouse)\n\nKane does reach the lighthouse but he can't defeat the alien. Sometimes in life one reaches a situation so painful that one does not have the ability to handle it - something like a mental breakdown. At that point in life, who somebody is - their identity - incapable of handling the present situation has no choice but to blow themselves up. The Kane that survives the shimmer is a clone, he's not the Kane that went in. This could be seen as a metaphor for those who when entering a period of self-destruction get hammered and destroyed. They make it out, but the person who makes it out is not the same person who entered.\n\nLena reaches the lighthouse and the alien, her enemy, the one that blocks the door from her escaping, the one that mirrors and mimics her, she sees as herself. \n\nThis is perhaps an inspirational message to those dealing with self-destructive issues. It's you who is blocking you and the only way you make it out of the shimmer is to blow that shit up.\n\nOnce she does that, the shimmer vanishes and Kane recovers. This may be a metaphor for somebody who successfully is able to defeat  their self-destructive tendencies. Things return to normal and those around them heal, even if nobody is quite the same as before they entered.\n\nAnd for the shimmer appearing in their eyes. If you have been through a period of self-destruction, you can often see it in the eyes of others who have been there too.

The next day, October 6, Willy Fulton, a Kodiak air taxi pilot, arrived at Treadwell and Huguenard's campsite to pick them up but found the area abandoned, except for a bear, and contacted the local park rangers. The couple's mangled remains were discovered quickly upon investigation. Treadwell's disfigured head, partial spine, and right forearm and hand, with his wristwatch still on, were recovered a short distance from the camp. Huguenard's partial remains were found next to the torn and collapsed tents, partially buried in a mound of twigs and dirt. A large male grizzly (tagged Bear 141) protecting the campsite was killed by park rangers during their attempt to retrieve the bodies. A second adolescent bear was also killed a short time later, when it charged the park rangers. An on-site necropsy of Bear 141 revealed human body parts such as fingers and limbs. The younger bear was consumed by other animals before it could be necropsied. In the 85-year history of Katmai National Park, this was the first known incident of a person being killed by a bear.  \n\n> A video camera was recovered at the site that proved to have been operating during the attack, but police said that the six-minute tape contained only voices and cries as a brown bear mauled Treadwell to death. The tape begins with Treadwell yelling that he is being attacked. \"Come out here; I'm being killed out here,\" he screams. That the tape contained only sound led troopers to believe the attack might have happened while the camera was stuffed in a duffel bag or during the dark of night. In Grizzly Man, filmmaker Herzog claims that the lens cap of the camera was left on, suggesting that Treadwell and Huguenard were in the process of setting up for another video sequence when the attack happened. The camera had been turned on just before the attack, presumably by sound activation, but the camera recorded only six minutes of audio before running out of tape. This, however, was enough time to record the bear's initial attack on Treadwell and his agonized screams, its retreat after Huguenard tells Treadwell to play dead and when she attacked it and its return to carry Treadwell off into the forest.  \n\n\nAny recording you find online is fake btw.
