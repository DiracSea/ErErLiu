I strongly disagree with the notion of making the character evil or a killer, that would make the movie too generic by having a creepy villain instead of a guy who made one terrible decision and tried to hide it. My biggest issue with Passengers was they added multiple moments near the end where Chris Pratt should've died but then miraculously was saved until we got the happy ending, the final act really made the whole thing a little contrived and cliche. I would've had Pratt's character die the first time, and finished the film with Lawrence succumb to the same weakness he did, however I get that maybe that's not the feel good ending people would want from a film like that and to make it a horror or thriller and have Pratt be a bad guy would make that sort of ending more palatable.
