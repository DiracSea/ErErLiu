They both already have a ton of charisma and chemistry and are much better suited to the athletic and action heavy roles of Valerian and Laureline and would do a far better job delivering on the action and cheesy one-liners with Pratt hitting on Lawrence and her playing hard to get.   It would be far more entertaining to see them flying around the universe than what we got in DeHaan pretending to be a character he isn't suited for and having zero chemistry with Laureline.   \n  \nOn the other hand, you could have DeHaan in Passengers as the creepy loner and sole awakened passenger.  Slinking around the ship by himself, slowly succumbing to the isolation and going insane until he awakens Delevingne and awkwardly convinces her to fall in love with him.    \n  \nI think this works better because it always bugged me in Passengers that Pratt and Lawrence just so happen to be the most attractive people and have this amazingly natural on-screen chemistry right off the bat?  It would be far more interesting to have DeHaan chasing after a hesitant Delevingne and I think having him in that role being creepy and doing generally morally questionable things is much more compelling.     \n  \nI also think in this case, Passengers could fully commit to being more of a sci-fi horror/thriller that it wanted to be (okay, that **I** wanted it to be).  Instead of having him make the cliche third act sacrifice and then they fall in love, set up something much darker:     \n  \nKeep it mostly the same through the first two acts.  Jim (DeHaan) wakes up, alone and wanders around the ship for a year, with no one to talk to but the robot bartender and slowly goes insane.  Delevigne is woken up and is quietly and reluctantly falling in love with the only other person on board the ship.  She eventually realizes that her waking up wasn't an accident and that she is being gaslighted.  Naturally, she is horrified and runs off to another section of the ship and in a third act twist, discovers that she was actually not the first person DeHaan had tried this on.  That he had actually been awake much longer than he initially told her and failed several times before with other women whom he had to kill and seal off in another section of the ship.  You could even make it so the robot bartender is encouraging Jim's psychosis.
