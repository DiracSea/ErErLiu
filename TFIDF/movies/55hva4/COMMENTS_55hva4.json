People assume \"Steamboat Willy\" was, as it was a major breakthrough as its the first cartoon with sound.  Here's \"Plane Crazy\":\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kCZPzHg0h80\n\nHowever, if you want to get more technical, Disney's first cartoon was \"Oswald the Rabbit\", which was created by Disney and Ib Iwerks and was distributed by Universal.  However, an Universale producer (Charles Mintz) convinced most of Disney's staff to leave Disney and work only for Universal.  \"Plane Crazy\" was feverishly worked on in secret by Disney, Ubs, and Roy Disney, as Mickey was, in a way, their last chance.  Bob Iger finally got copyright rights back from Universal for Oswald recently.\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.inverse.com/amp/article/12582-walt-disney-s-weird-buddy-what-happened-to-oswald-the-lucky-rabbit?client=safari\n\nDisney also had a one or a few cartoons before Oswald- some even proving to be successful (looking at you, \"Alice Comedies\"), but Disney had a butt load of failed projects before he created Mickey.\n\nTL:DR: Disney made a bunch of other cartoons before sSteamboat Willy, some successful and some not.  And, most importantly, my Animation History teacher from college is probably crying tears of joy but doesn't know why.  \n\n**edited: autocorrect problems", "created_utc": 1475434809.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d8b3jab", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_55hva4", "parent_id": "t1_d8assnz", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/55hva4/disney_recycles_animation_when_they_are_on_a_time/d8b3jab/", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Tisanes", "author_id": "hbzj4", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "[deleted]", "created_utc": 1475422818.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1503555088.0, "id": "d8aun8i", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_55hva4", "parent_id": "t1_d8asn6s", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/55hva4/disney_recycles_animation_when_they_are_on_a_time/d8aun8i/", "score": 155, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Thank you for the link.

It's a very valuable tool. They'll typically record themselves giving a performance and then base their animation off the elements that they like (see [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/55hva4/disney_recycles_animation_when_they_are_on_a_time/d8ayq8d?context=3&st=itsw98r3&sh=e867123a) down below for great examples of this). Animators also have mirrors at their desks to pull facial expressions and lip sync from.\n\nThe reason Disney films have always had such lifelike humans is because even before they became skilled enough to do them using reference footage, they would straight up rotoscope them for their movies. They'd record an actor's performance, and then trace over every single pose frame by frame. They haven't done this for a long, long time, but all of the humans in Snow White are rotoscoped, for example (although they didn't admit it at the time).\n\nIt's kind of eerie how subtle and lifelike some of the characters in Snow White are. Here, take a look at [this little clip of Snow White and Grumpy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELxo18SrENQ&feature=youtu.be&t=5). She's animated using rotoscope, and he's not, and it's almost like she's actually a live person interacting with a flat little animated man.

It just uses a lot of computer tools to make the tedious manual labour faster.\n\nLots of animation students (me included) learned how to do Disney style (which really isn't unique to Disney at all) animation back in school. It's just an extremely time consuming method of animation and simply not financially viable for most productions nor very manageable for a single person to produce a large amount of work in.\n\nEven old school animators didn't do it by themselves. Typically the work division looked something like this:\n\n* Any given animation is all planned out on a dope sheet. This is a sheet that describes every single frame in a scene. Every key frame is marked on the dope sheet so every action is planned out to the millisecond. key frames which are the important frames in any action. For instance if you draw a character throwing a punch, the key frames might be the frame where the arm pulls back, the frame where the fist connects and the follow through of the punch.\n* The lead animator generally has a speciality like characters, vehicles, elements (water, fire etc.). This person draws the key frames.\n* The lead animator hands the pencilled keyframes to one of his assistants. The assistant animator draws all the frames in between keyframes. These frames are much easier to draw since the keyframes dictate the big changes and the in between frames are simply the transition between two key states.\n* The inker takes the frame sketches and overlays them with a piece of transparent film. He then traces the sketches with black ink, paying attention to line weights, black shadows and so on.\n* This sheet of film is then taken by someone who will flip it around and paint in the colors on the back of the film (this way the black outlines always overlay the colours. Easy to stay in the lines that way).\n\nThe above takes care of one element in a scene. For instance a character. Another team might animate the background. Yet another team might animate a vehicle in the scene and yet another team might animate elements like a torch with a flickering flame and smoke on the background.\n\nFinally all these transparent cells are stacked to form a complete frame for a scene and photographed to create the final frame of animation.\n\nAs you can see this is a huge amount of manual labour. Software for 2d and 3d animation can take care of a lot of the manual labour. But the art of animating a character hasn't changed all that much. It's still all about how the artists involved work with shape, movement, timing, bounce, stretch and squash. It's just the tools that have changed.\n\nAnd ofcourse since even digital animation can be very labour intensive, there's a lot of animation styles that try to reduce or even minimize the amount of work involved. A lot of television animation for instance uses a lot of cheats where for instance a character doesn't move at all except for his mouth or eyes in a scene. Or action scenes where there's minimal animation on the character but violent motion is suggested with sound and moving speed lines in the background.", "created_utc": 1475422012.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d8au4qu", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_55hva4", "parent_id": "t1_d8arsht", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/55hva4/disney_recycles_animation_when_they_are_on_a_time/d8au4qu/", "score": 28, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "TheSecretMe", "author_id": "65dpk", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Using Humans as a reference is standard in the animation industry.

In illustration, an object or person's center of gravity does not align with the perspective of the surroundings, so it looks a bit like they're floating in space. Animators are usually more careful about this, and including a background layer as they draw helps to reduce the instances of this issue. It can still happen even at the Hollywood professional level, but usually it's not too noticeable unless you actively look for it.\n\nHowever, when you're rotoscoping, you run into several issues (such as over-detailing) and because you aren't using in-between frames, the movement is very very smooth, compared to the more jerky piece-meal of the purely drawn characters. Animators also then have the added difficulty of lining up the video angle with the drawn background, and so characters can end up looking like they're floating or gliding - they run down a hallway too fast,  their feet don't align with steps or elevation changes, and they may not even seem to entirely touch or be on the line of sight of other characters. Their center of gravity is not *quite* on the same plane, thus, SMS. \n\nSnow White looks like she is moving without any friction or balance issues, wile Grumpy looks like he has to work for his movements. His center of gravity also aligns with the background, and his movements emphasize weight when stomping and running into the tree.
