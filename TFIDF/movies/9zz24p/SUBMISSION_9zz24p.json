Because his son presses him, Tim Allen's character puts on the Santa Suit (I guess if he didn't do this strange thing, there would be no more Santa?), and in doing so sets off the titular clause pressing him into service as Santa.\n\nIn the *second* film, Tim Allen, now Santa, discovers a \"Mrs. Clause\" that requires him to get hitched or he'll no longer be Santa. Again, I suppose if he doesn't do this there just won't be a Santa anymore.\n\nSo here's the realization I had. The *previous* Santa must have been under the same contractual obligations, meaning that somewhere back at the North Pole, he had a wife. But... we don't see any sign of her by the time Tim Allen's character gets there. What happened to her!?\n\nThe way I figure, one of two things happened: Either she automatically died when her husband did, or once the elves found out her husband died, they told her to GTFO. Either way, the elves evidently chose to never speak of her again.", "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "title": "I just had an odd realization: the elves in Tim Allen's Santa Clause movies are hiding a terrible secret", "url": null, "author_name": "CaspianX2", "author_id": "39174", "subreddit_name": "movies", "upvote_ratio": 0.87}
