Pre-vis is about blocking and making sure the shots can be properly followed by your audience. \n\nHere's pre-vis for recent films for comparison:\n\n\nLOTR:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnKs5alc9_0\n\nMatrix Reloaded:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMMeHPGV5VE\n\n\nWWZ:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkzpWzjyITQ\n\nYou might notice that pre-vis increased in quality over time. That's because modern pre-vis work is done with purpose-built tools to rapidly animate using stock models. It is also done primarily for FX-heavy shots and highy dynamic action scenes. In 1992-1993, when Jurassic Park was in production, they would have done normal storyboarding, then recorded the storyboards on cheap film, a process called \"Animatics\". This way, when you have a storyboard showing a blocky arrow pointing up, you can move the camera up that same way over the story board to get a nice-looking result. \n\nPre-vis was sometimes done with dolls, too, but again, mainly for shots that are especially logistically complex. The speeder-bike scene in ROTJ was done with miniatures first, for example. \n\nThat being said, there actually was a bit of digital pre-vis done for Jurassic Park, though only for individual shots, not whole sequences. They used an application called Lightwave 3D.\n\nIt wasn't until Mission Impossible in 1995/1996 that a whole sequence was pre-vised digitally. \n\n", "created_utc": 1530365196.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e1ju9da", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8v0ut3", "parent_id": "t1_e1jq4uc", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8v0ut3/previsualisation_of_the_famous_raptor_kitchen/e1ju9da/", "score": 35, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "NazzerDawk", "author_id": "63iec", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I actually loved Lex in the book because she behaved so realistically for her age being in that situation.

It makes you, the viewer, feel hunted. Even in the cuts when they are ostensibly in the background, the focus is on them. Having just watched the final version again quick, in the static camera shots where Lex and Tim are in the foreground, the kids are still but the Velociraptors are moving, in the static camera shots where Lex and Tim are moving, the kids are generally in the background or the bottom edge. This gives the Velocirapors sentience. \n\nAs a related thing, the composition is such that their eyes, not theirs claws, are the focus. There is, of course, one notable, and extremely effective pair of exceptions to this, but it actually adds to the sense of intelligence. The claw-clicking is a fidget, like clicking a pen, which is not a mannerism associated with a bear or tiger, for instance. The focus on this very human action makes them seem more sentient.\n\nThe camera moves are synced in response to *their* actions, and more importantly their \u201cthoughts,\u201d not generally Lex and Tim\u2019s. My favorite example is the scene where the raptor is sniffing the spoon, and as she looks up, the camera fluidly moves towards Tim. The raptor is *reasoning out* what is going on, and where the prey must be, and the camera is emphasizing that putting 2+2 together just as surely as the fantastic animation work is.\n\nSeriously, go watch it with a conscious emphasis on what the camera is getting you to feel.
