It's Hollywood, it's always been about money. The Hayes code was the standard for a long time, and movie-making was really just like any other hierarchical business. There are great movies from the pre-60s and 70s, but because of rules and money the *types* of movies you saw were pretty bland. These days independent filmmaking is where it's at, it's far more accessible and there are people with truly great ideas who aren't in it just for a $100 million paycheck. \n\nShia definitely has some issues but he really is an impressive actor. Clearly, when he's dedicated to a role he puts everything he's got into it. I would have never expected the kid from *Even Stevens* would develop into such a great actor. I wish he would straighten himself out a bit because his behavior isn't going to help him get good roles, that's for sure. \n\nBoth Shia and Ford have said and done some *really* dumb fucking shit and they *both* need to learn when to keep their mouths shut.

Quite frankly, after reading that  I have to say fuck Steven Spielberg and fuck Harrison Ford. Shia accepts some of his own responsibility and he gives some serious praise to Spielberg, he also says Harrison wasn't happy with the film either and I'm fairly certain that's the case as I recall comments from him about it as well. Ultimately, Spielberg just doesn't want *any* negative publicity for a potentially hugely profitable film from one of its' lead actors. If you don't want that, then get them to sign a contract/NDA and shut the fuck up. Hollywood is just a mess and this one fantastic example of why.
