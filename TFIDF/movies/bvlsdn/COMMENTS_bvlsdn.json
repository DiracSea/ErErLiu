The issue isn\u2019t pedophilia as much as it is clericalism. \n\nPost Enlightenment and post- Plague Europe created a vacuum of good, knowledgeable men to serve in the priesthood. As general health increased, families became larger and so the ability for that \u201cone weird uncle\u201d that every family has to become a priest in a family of 10+ was a way to differentiate himself and not cause scandal by being unmarried. If one reads some of the accounts against the Church from the reformation, the same charges of pedophilia existed 500 years ago. \n\nThe answer is to give the church back to the people that created it in the first place. There is still a way to do this canonically and preserve the one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church while abolishing clericalism. Part of this is letting priests have families. The Church can protect itself legally from families inheriting assets inappropriately. And weeding out pedos and replacing them with solid Christian men with families is a good first step. Protestants have successfully proven this works more or less in the last 500 years. \n\nDo this and watch the pews fill in along with the collection baskets. Keep on this path now and the gates of hell won\u2019t prevail on the Church but will on everyone else left holding the bag of ignorance and unwillingness to hold the leadership accountable.

I'm posting the stuff from her wiki page below. Her career took a massive nosedive from this. I'm pretty disgusted with Joe Pesci. And there's a later section that talks about Madonna being pretty horrible to Sinead O'Connor to somehow protect the sales of an album that was coming out soon by Madonna, because it looked like she was jealous of all the attention Sinead was getting in the media. \n\nAside from all of that, 1992 was not that far from 1999. Sure, people knew about it. But maybe not how widespread it was beyond just \"a few bad apples.\" \n\n\"On 3 October 1992, O'Connor appeared on Saturday Night Live as a musical guest. She sang an a cappella version of Bob Marley's \"War\", which she intended as a protest against sexual abuse of children in the Catholic Church, referring to child abuse rather than racism.[42] She then presented a photo of Pope John Paul II to the camera while singing the word \"evil\", after which she tore the photo into pieces, said \"Fight the real enemy\", and threw the pieces towards the camera.[43] The incident occurred nine years before John Paul II acknowledged the sexual abuse within the Church.[44]\n\nSaturday Night Live had no foreknowledge of O'Connor's plan; during the dress rehearsal, she held up a photo of a refugee child. NBC Vice-President of Late Night Rick Ludwin recalled that when he saw O'Connor's action, he \"literally jumped out of [his] chair\". SNL writer Paula Pell recalled personnel in the control booth discussing the cameras cutting away.[45] The audience was completely silent, with no booing or applause;[46] executive producer Lorne Michaels recalled that \"the air went out the studio\". He ordered that the applause sign not be used.[45]\n\nA nationwide audience saw O'Connor's live performance, which the New York Daily News's cover called a \"Holy Terror\".[45] NBC received more than 500 calls on Sunday[47] and 400 more on Monday, with all but seven criticising O'Connor;[46] the network received 4,400 calls in total.[48] Contrary to rumour, NBC was not fined by the Federal Communications Commission for O'Connor's act, and the FCC has no regulatory power over such behaviour.[48] NBC did not edit the performance out of the West coast tape-delayed broadcast that night.[49] As of 2016, NBC broadcasts reruns of the episode using footage from the dress rehearsal.[48]\n\nDuring his opening monologue the following week, Catholic-raised host Joe Pesci held up the photo, explaining that he had taped it back together, to huge applause. Pesci also said that if it had been his show, \"I would have gave her such a smack\".[50]\n\nIn a 2002 interview with Salon, when asked if she would change anything about the SNL appearance, O'Connor replied, \"Hell, no!\"[51] On 24 April 2010, MSNBC aired the live version during an interview with O'Connor on The Rachel Maddow Show.[citation needed]\"", "created_utc": 1559412637.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "epqujrw", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_bvlsdn", "parent_id": "t1_epqp7ob", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/bvlsdn/documentary_only_dont_tell_anyone_has_sparked/epqujrw/", "score": 105, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Waitwhatismybodydoin", "author_id": "x8jbp", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "But my brain keeps trying to tell me the 90s were 10 years ago, so that doesn't make sense.", "created_utc": 1559411445.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "epqsc7c", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_bvlsdn", "parent_id": "t1_epqp7ob", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/bvlsdn/documentary_only_dont_tell_anyone_has_sparked/epqsc7c/", "score": 47, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "AgentInCommand", "author_id": "17cotz", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "People knew and talked about it way before then.
