Language that 12-14 year olds are using or - at the very least - *hearing* in school...  means it should be Rated-R?!?  Ultimately it was resubmitted with some language edited out, and given a PG-13 rating.  Which is, quite simply, ridiculous.  \n\nquoted from its IMDB trivia page:\n>\"Bully was originally rated R for language. The Weinstein Company appealed for a lower rating, as the R rating would exclude the very audience that is was intended for - high-school teens. The MPAA refused to alter the rating, so the distributor surrendered the original rating and opted for their film to be released 'Unrated' to the theaters. Finally, the filmmakers agreed to cut some, but not all, of the relevant language, and the MPAA did agree to re-rate the movie PG-13. The PG-13 version does keep intact all the language in the scene that was the main point of contention between the filmmakers and the MPAA, in which a 12-year-old is physically and verbally attacked on his school bus by his classmates.\"", "created_utc": 1472357598.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d6zly9e", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_4zwyp6", "parent_id": "t3_4zwyp6", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/4zwyp6/mike_birbiglia_tweeted_this_in_response_to_the_r/d6zly9e/", "score": 69, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Ollivander451", "author_id": "fe03f", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "To think this movie is in the same rating category as Deadpool.
