Even the writer regrets going about it that way. \n\nIf they change it around where Joker tortures Babs in order to break HER and not Gordon it'd be fantastic. Joker was going through all this mostly to get at Bats, so if he finds out Babs is Batgirl (since the story is intended to be non-canon) and goes after her first, tortures her until he gets bored, and then realizes he can use that against Gordon and goes after Gordon, that has a much better feel then him just torturing her in order to torture Gordon. \n\nTimm loves Batgirl, so he's probably never been fond of the story treatment of her either.

Because of those definitions rape is almost always preceded by sexual assault, but is not itself sexual assault in most cases.\n\nSexual Battery is someone touching your butt inappropriately or without your consent but not necessarily harming you. In some states it requires you to be unconscious, unable to give consent, or to be restrained by another.\n\nSexual Assault involves some form of harm, threat of harm, or violence, molestation, or your inability to consent/comprehend the situation to force you into the inappropriate contact. So sexual assault is ripping off your pants to touch your butt.\n\nRape requires some form of threat or violence and is defined as forceful penetration in many jurisdictions (part of the 'Men can't be raped' problem is this definition). I believe this has been extended to include any form of sexual act involving genitalia.", "created_utc": 1460689900.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d23jtgl", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_4eu1yr", "parent_id": "t1_d23iqn2", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/4eu1yr/batman_the_killing_joke_animated_movie_receives_r/d23jtgl/", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Sparkybear", "author_id": "4g8rr", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "[Symmetric property, man.](http://www.mathwords.com/s/symmetric_property.htm)", "created_utc": 1460698207.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d23o41z", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_4eu1yr", "parent_id": "t1_d23iqn2", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/4eu1yr/batman_the_killing_joke_animated_movie_receives_r/d23o41z/", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "DarrSwan", "author_id": "djsj1", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Minor correction, but Batman actually says that in Endgame, not DoTF.", "created_utc": 1460694945.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d23mn1z", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_4eu1yr", "parent_id": "t1_d23jguq", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/4eu1yr/batman_the_killing_joke_animated_movie_receives_r/d23mn1z/", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "BabSoul", "author_id": "eossx", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Can you please explain more? \n\nI don't recall the ending well but i remember the joke the joker tells if that's what you meant about turning the light off.", "created_utc": 1460739844.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d2475xf", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_4eu1yr", "parent_id": "t1_d23jguq", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/4eu1yr/batman_the_killing_joke_animated_movie_receives_r/d2475xf/", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "spawnend", "author_id": "gz0qq", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "DoTF?", "created_utc": 1460693291.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d23ls11", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_4eu1yr", "parent_id": "t1_d23jguq", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/4eu1yr/batman_the_killing_joke_animated_movie_receives_r/d23ls11/", "score": 6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "mr_chip", "author_id": "4i9oz", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Grant Morrison didn't work on The Killing Joke.

You can walk along the beam and join me!\u201d \n\nBatman has the tools, the connection, and the plan, he truly wants to, and could help the Joker, if he would let him.\n\n>B-but the second guy just shakes his head. He suh-says\u2026 He says \u201cWh-what do you think I am? Crazy? You\u2019d turn it off when I was half way across!\u201d\n\nand here's the crux of the matter. The only person the Joker is afraid of is his fellow inmate,  Batman, he doesn't trust him, and perhaps Batman doesn't trust himself in the face of his own hatred for the Joker. This is the joker saying \"I'd accept your offer, but I don't know you resist your own rage either, perhaps you're the crazier of the two of us\"\n\nand Batman cracks a smile, and then breaks out into laughter - because he knows that  the Joker could be right, that he *is* the more driven, more extreme, of the two of them.he laughs because the Joker calls *him* the monster, and in the face of the irony in someone finally knowing Batman better than he knows himself, the only sane reaction is to laugh.\n\nthere's a great post about it over here too: https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/3obe46/meaning_behind_jokers_joke_to_batman_in_the/", "created_utc": 1460742622.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d249ap5", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_4eu1yr", "parent_id": "t1_d2475xf", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/4eu1yr/batman_the_killing_joke_animated_movie_receives_r/d249ap5/", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "databeast", "author_id": "d6jvh", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "(probably Death of the Family, although that doesn't explain why the T is capitalized)", "created_utc": 1460695634.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d23mz45", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_4eu1yr", "parent_id": "t1_d23ls11", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/4eu1yr/batman_the_killing_joke_animated_movie_receives_r/d23mz45/", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "vgxmaster", "author_id": "88ik1", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": ">flashback\n\n-\n\n>he wasn't there\n\nSounds like some powerful shit.", "created_utc": 1460689514.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d23jjn3", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_4eu1yr", "parent_id": "t1_d23iefi", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/4eu1yr/batman_the_killing_joke_animated_movie_receives_r/d23jjn3/", "score": 70, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Murgie", "author_id": "c04l5", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Which was kind of the theme of the game, reliving Bruce's failures where he wasn't around to protect people.
