Both the logical, and typical star wars response would be to send strike craft to take care of him.  Instead, nothing happens.  They don't even open fire despite being the fucking Empire.  Next, after making those stupid jokes, he then proceeds to destroy all the turbolaser towers alone...without using proton torpedos even, the only weapon capable of efficiently taking down towers that size.  Strike craft are still not sent.  It's worth noting that a Star Destroyer is essentially a battleship and a carrier fused together; there is not one scene in all of Star Wars that an attacking Star Destroyer has not deployed strike craft, save in Empire Strikes Back when they are deploying landing craft, and when they are disabled by ion cannons.  Then, he apparently pilots the x-wing like a borg cube and can apparently defy any previous convention as to how they work.  No one in the entire series, jedi or not has done that with a craft.  Especially not with X-Wings, which let me remind you are NOT the agile spacecraft of the Star Wars series; they are a medium strike fighter.  The moves he pulled off would only make sense with an A-Wing since the whole point of it is speed and maneuverability sacrificing all else.](#spoiler)  \n\nWhile I did go off on a slight tangent because that scene was just annoying to me for so many reasons, the point is that a character was given plot armor for the sole reason for telling a \"yo mama\" joke - and it's only the first of many times that this happens in the movie, where the characters are actually parodies of themselves [oh and dont forget when 90% of the Republic died in The Last Jedi just because the moron captain pulled a \"BECAUSE I SAID SO\" and didn't so much as try to keep an eye on him; half of the movie was \"OH FUCK WE DONT HAVE FUEL\" and cutting to Finn and friends not only getting nothing done in futility, but even killing off 90% of the Republic when the vague instructions on how to proceed land them in oh so many situations due to \"oh we can track through hyperspace and it's not something that makes sense like having a mole or tracker on board\"](#spoiler)\n\nIt's not like Star Wars is absent in humor; I recall one of my favorite amusing scenes was Han chasing stormtroopers down a hallway yelling only to find an entire division standing in formation, then running back with a somewhat higher pitched yelling.  The difference is; there was no slapstick, and it didn't put a kebash on the dramatic tension.  He didn't stop, and go \"Aw come on boys, you were celebrating the holiday and didn't invite me?\".  He fucking panicked and ran for his life.  In TLJ when the characters are in the shit because of how terrible they are at being even remotely heroic, the plot armor kicks in to diffuse the situation, or even kicking in so that they can throw their stupid slapstick one-liner while everyone is dying around them.

If Transformers films can continue to gross more than their disgustingly large budget, there's no legitimate excuse for making a terrible movie. \n\nNow, with this argument, you're obviously going to wonder why there's so many terrible blockbusters if it's as easy as I said. And that's simple: Hollywood is run by total morons. The only people with the brains in their head to figure out the formula are either working for Disney or making Transformers films. Think about it: Disney has had so many successful blockbusters lately that it no longer is logical to say it's difficult. Between Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and everything else they do, they pretty much ought to just buy the Federal Reserve at this point. If the people making these films weren't total idiots, they'd do fine. Stop trying to make video game movies. That's a stupid way of thinking. You don't make book movies, you adapt the plot of the book into a movie. Remember Ang Lee's Hulk and how it took the concept of a \"comic book movie\" stupidly literally? That's the problem with video game movies. Take the plot or the universe as a whole and adapt it into a film. Halo did it pretty well by making it an original story in the universe.

It was a bad case of 'tell not show'. I think there was a lot of potential there to explore what he was about (a terrorist more than anything). Instead he just kind of opens the hatch (I literally thought he was one of the Deathstalkers at first since his armor looks almost the same in that first scene) and then... uh... that's basically it, then we're back to the girl and Saw is nowhere around.\n\nFrom what I understand, he was largely there because he was in that Clone Wars thing I never watched. I can't feel that that's not 100% my fault, you shouldn't be forced to watch something that isn't connected to the movies to 'get' the purpose of an entire character.\n\n**EDIT:** That said after Rian Johnson's fucking disaster of a film, the brain octopus is far from the worst example of something that didn't need to be in a film.
