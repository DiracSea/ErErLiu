But they do look good as advertisements. They're meant to catch your eye when you're sitting in traffic, or walking by the movie theater.\n\nTake this [King Arthur poster](http://advancescreenings.com/img/posters/k/king_arthur_legend_of_the_sword_t.jpg) for instance... I've been seeing this one a lot recently. The main draw is that Charlie Hunnam is in it. So they literally just made a movie poster of his face. They could've, ya know, made an epic stylized painting of King Arthur pulling Excalibur from the stone or something... But the marketing, they just want you to know that the guy from *Sons of Anarchy* is in it. That's all the information you need to make a decision on whether you're the kind of person who wants to see this movie.\n\nOr, look at the poster [for the first Avengers film](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/0f/03/e6/0f03e6733b0cf567cc92e8e20290462f.jpg). You think that the average person walking around the mall cares to dissect a piece of surrealist art? No way! If you're marketing a film, you want to convey something within a few seconds. The consumer will see your poster, say \"Heck, I didn't realize the Avengers is coming out next week! Cool explosions! And hey, Scarlett Johanson is in it... Boner town!\"\n\nPoint being, you overestimate the average consumer. And btw, it's been a few years since I went to Europe, but I saw *Man of Steel* when I was there. Guess what? They used the same movie posters. These \"international posters\" you're imagining, they're not as prevalent as you'd imagine. Americans aren't just automatically dumber when it comes to consuming art. Europeans (and a lot of Chinese movie posters as well, btw) fall prey to the same marketing tactics.\n\nEDIT: if you want to see a funny analysis of a Chinese movie poster compared to an American one, check out this [Judging by the Cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmADjddw6qE).

I mean there are a lot of nerds out there and the movies have actually caused some people to get excited and into comics but the comic fan base is so small they'd have never gotten their money back if that was who they targeted.\n\nI remember being in the army before super hero movies were cool and how guys would mock the nerds that went to see the movies and such. Years later those same assholes are workign out at the gym in Iron Man and Batman shirts lol. Marvel and DC even were trying to change the feel of what comic based movies felt like, and the most important part of that marketing was to make sure the audience didn't feel like they were the nerds they used to make fun off for all those years lol.
