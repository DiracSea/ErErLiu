By which I mean that each shot has very few, if any, cuts and changes of camera angle, especially the action scenes. Each shot looks like a frame of a graphic novel, except come to life. Same thing with the dialogue. It's all sort of one-liners and catch-phrases, you can almost imagine those shots as being frames in a comic with a stylized speech bubble reading those lines out\n\n2) it's a tribute to the classic martial arts movies. They purposely follow certain clich\u00e9s and tropes. Like the final boss battle in the dark, in the rain, with the big-boss head of the baddies after defeating all the henchmen. It's like an old-school samurai movie or kung fu movie.\n\nIf you keep those two things in mind when watching them, suddenly they become stylistic masterpieces. Like how The Magnificent Seven is a cowboy-western remake of 7 Samurai, or how Star Wars is a sci-fi tribute to fantasy stories (knights, wizards, dark lords, farmer-is-the-chosen-one, etc.). When you watch John Wick with that sort of mindset, it really gets more enjoyable.

In a film, this would be John Wick going from bar to bar saying \"yes, I'm a badass, I kicked the ass of three guys in a bar with a pencil.  Can you believe that?\" \n\nAs an audience, no, we can't.   We never see him in a fist fight, we just see randos in a bar that don't even know Wick agreeing that they don't want to fight him.  \n\nIt feels inauthentic.  \n\nIn contrast, in John Wick, *he* never says anything about being a badass.  However, other characters *react* to him with great deference.  Characters who are shown to be badasses.  We see Aurelio, a character with a chop shop that is parting out a goddamn GT40, become frightened that John Wick's car is suddenly in his shop.   We see him strike a guy that we've already seen is somewhat of a badass and doesn't cower when one of his cronies points a gun at his head.  But he's terrified of John Wick.  When the head of the Russian mafia calls him because the guy he struck is the son of that mob boss, Aurelio explains why he did that.  Then, this titan of the underworld, a guy we don't have to infer anything about, simply says \"oh\".  It's obvious his son has fucked up big time and there is a very good reason he got hit.   I should also point out that Aurelio was wary of Vigo, but he was outright terrified of John Wick. \n\nJohn Wick never told you he was a badass.  The other characters showed you through their actions. \n\nIn advertising, there's talk about the three levels of advertising and their effectiveness.  The first is direct.  This is when I tell you how great my business is.  This would be the equivalent of a cold call.  It works sometimes, but it's not very effective.   This is what poor writers and screenwriters do. \n\nThe second is indirect, like an advertisement.  This is you driving by on the freeway and seeing a billboard for my product.   It's much more effective, but in the back of your mind, you know I paid for that advertisement and there's no real substance behind it.   A mediocre film would show John Wick kicking a bunch of rando's asses in a bar.  We wouldn't know them or know how competent they were, but we'd see some flash and be excited.  A lot of movies and novels use this kind of storytelling. \n\nThe third level is recommendation or word of mouth.   This is when your friend comes up to you and tells you what an awesome business I have.   This is *extremely* effective if you can get it and is one of the most effective forms of advertising there is because it feels very sincere.   This is how John Wick is advertised to the audience.   We can tell he's a badass because of the way people interact and react to him.  People we've been shown already to be badasses themselves.  It reinforces the idea that John is very special.   Twenty minutes into the movie, we've never even seen John in action, never seen him throw a punch, never seen him fire a gun -- yet we know *exactly* what to expect when Vigo sends his best men into his home.

Also, not sure if this is just the plot or if the director just got bored of Keeanu's character and acting because he's not really in the story after the first quarter of the film.\n\nAlso the only film techniques they used were those available around the time that film was invented!\n\nThe good book Wikipedia has some deetz on this:\n    Coppola was insistent that he did not want to use any kind of contemporary special effects techniques such as computer-generated imagery when making the movie, instead wishing to use antiquated effects techniques from the early history of cinema, which he felt would be more appropriate given the film's period setting coincides with the origin of film. He initially hired a standard visual effects team, but when they told him that the things he wanted to achieve were impossible without using modern digital technology, Coppola disagreed and fired them, replacing them with his son Roman Coppola. As a result, all of the visual effects seen in the film were achieved without the use of optical or computer generated effects, but were created using on-set and in-camera methods. For example, any sequences that would have typically required the use of compositing, were instead achieved by either rear projection with actors placed in front of a screen with an image projected behind them, or through multiple exposure by shooting a background slate then rewinding the film through the camera and shooting the foreground slate on the same piece of film, all the while using matting techniques to ensure that only the desired areas of film were exposed. Forced perspectives were often employed to combine miniature effects or matte paintings with full sized elements, or create distorted views of reality, such as holding the camera upside down or at odd angles to create the effect of objects defying the laws of physics.[12]\n\n", "created_utc": 1510935819.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1510936003.0, "id": "dpypons", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7dkj75", "parent_id": "t1_dpyjkep", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7dkj75/john_wick_solidified_keanu_reeves_as_one_of_the/dpypons/", "score": 18, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "amazeface", "author_id": "km99m", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "You pretty much just described reeves movie career.

Its the fairest free-to-play that i've ever seen, and the gameplay is pretty damn good.  You can get every Warframe weapon via earning it yourself, although you can also outright buy what you want.  \n\nThe in-game currency goes on sale semi-frequently (You can get 20, 50, or 75% off as a daily login reward) - $50 at 75% off will buy you every single warframe, and a large chunk of the weapons if you wanted to go that route.  \n\nApart from that, all the things that you can ONLY acquire with money are exclusively cosmetic.  Earning things only requires that you grind for materials (which has no daily limit / time limitation associated with it) \n\nBuilding weapons / warframes takes between 12 and 72 realtime hours (Which still passes when you're logged off) but you can push a 'I want it now' button for the premium currency, but even that is fairly reasonable.   \n\nAssuming you got a 75% off sale and spent $50, thats 4300 platinum.  Warframes are usually 225 platinum, rushing an item build is typically 25 platinum.  (Thats less than 3 bucks for a warframe, and pennies for a rush)\n\nOH, and there's frequent sales in-game on things as well, so you can get both a sale on Platinum *and* the thing you want, if you're patient. I've paid as little as 50 cents for a good weapon.\n\nThe graphics are pretty dang good too (Old gif, they've improved since this https://i.imgur.com/00d3A9Z.gifv) \n\nAlso, I love the origin of the game, which was some guy telling the developers \"You can't make something like this for that cheap!\" To which they replied, \"Fuck it, I'ma do it anyway.\" and have gone on to trounce AAA titles from other studios that charged a ton more.
