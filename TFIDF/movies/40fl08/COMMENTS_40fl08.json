One night we broke for \"lunch\" which was being catered at a local restaurant. I was sitting at a table when from behind I heard David's voice \"Do you mind if I join you?\". I said \"Of course, David\". We spent the hour talking music. I mentioned that I had grown up in New Orleans so mostly we spoke about the great early Blues and Rock and Roll artists that he had listened to as a teenager in England. We spoke often during the few weeks I worked on the film. He was intensely genuine, modest and friendly.

It just doesn't feel like something that's supposed to happen. Like, it doesn't fit the narrative of human history, you know? His story wasn't complete or something. I don't know.\n\nLooking at the comments I can see other people feel the same way and none of us can put this into words\n\n*Something* is going on. Whether it's all in our heads or somehthing beyond understanding. But things are happening that just seem way way off. Like the flow of time is getting distorted. I don't know. \n\nMaybe it's the effect so many celebrities dying in a such a connected world. back in the 1950's celebrities weren't that huge and werent a part of people's childhood. You often had older stars who didnt start in their 20's. When they died, it wasnt as huge of an effect because people only saw them on TV. people werent so exposed. Jump to today and we can actually talk to celebrities. We can be heard by them. They're much more human and yet at the same time much more god-like (or infamous demon-like). So when they die, you know right away because you dont have to wait to see it in the paper or on TV or hear about it months later because you skipped watching TV one night.\n\nSo maybe we're just being so exposed. People are living longing and we're really one of the first groups of people (born in the 70's and onward) in the free world to actually be born in a world with super stars that are just alive forever and are always there. So when they die, a small piece of us dies with them. Michael Jackson was just always there. He was freaking Michael Jackson, a genre all his own. Everyone knew him. Then he dies? What!? Bernie Mac dies? I cannot even. Robin freaking Williams passes??? What kind of fucked up world do we live in where Robin Williams is taken away from humanity, especially in such a tragic way with his illness. And now David Bowie out of now where.\n\nThese people are ingrained in us because most of us were born when during their fame and grow up as their fame grows. So they're just these entities that are somewhere in the world doing things. Down the road, like 30-40 years from now, the deaths of newer super stars are going to hit hard for the younger generation and maybe for those of us still around. it'll be interesting to see how it affects us when we're old.

But Robin Williams death was so tragic because there was probably a chance that it could have been prevented, or at least delayed to a point where he would pass in a less brutal way. David Bowie didn't choose to die. I'm not saying Robin Williams chose death either, since we now know that a plethora of health problems probably drove him to a point where he really felt like there was no alternative. But knowing that someone so beloved by so many was in a place so dark that they felt they had to put an end to their own life, that really stings :/ This is all speculative, I in no way claim to know or understand the full circumstances of either David Bowie's or Robin Williams' passing.
