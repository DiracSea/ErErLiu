Thurman is brilliant. She's long had a reputation for being sharp and ambitious. We can see it here. She's not just hopping on the bandwagon. She's not just riding the coattails of the movement. She's expressing how she's been grappling with these issues for years and tentatively opening up about them in an environment that she's hoping to be safe. And I think it is a safe one for her. Few people would condemn her for what she's said.\n\n\nBut as I said, what's sad is there's not more talk like this. You can be complicit in a crime and a victim of a crime at the same time. You can be part of a toxic environment even as the environment poisons you as well. It happens all the time. \n\n\nWhen an employee sees their boss being bigoted but doesn't speak up because it's not targeted at them. \n\n\nWhen a kid who gets beaten at home goes to school and bullies someone else.\n\n\nWhen someone gets molested and their sense of personal boundaries degrades to the point that they don't know what counts as appropriate contact and what doesn't.\n\n\n\nWhen a kid in a gang gets pushed around every day but then still does what they say because without those guys they wouldn't have anyone.\n\n\nHappens in the military, in prisons, in universities, in all kinds of workplaces and industries. You can be damn sure it happens in politics. One of the problems with any legal reform is politicians spend decades working their way to high offices, salivating at the chance to \"get theirs\". So when they spend 30 years as interns, assistants, coffee fetchers, advisors, etc, they don't want to degrade the very power they've been sacrificing for all along by doing the right thing.\n\n\nIt's the same in Hollywood. When you play nice with the corruption you get treated well. When you give them offerings or keep quiet on their behavior or cover for them or defend them publicly, they reward you. When a dozen people are willing to sink to new lows for a chance at the big time, what choice do the people with standards have? What if Thurman *had* spoken up? Would we even care what she has to say today? Or would she be a \"washed-up has-been\" after an industry blacklisting ended her career?\n\n\nThe harder question is, how much did she want to speak up? She was treated badly, but if you told someone *\"I'll give you millions of dollars and make you famous but you have to go to Harvey Weinstein's hotel room and try to deflect his advances,\"* do you think they would do it? A lot of people would. A lot of people would outright sleep with Weinstein for money and status. And that's not a hypothetical. We **know** now that people did this and that people still do this with other powerful people.\n\n\nWhere does that fit into things?

Does she want to open up that rapey can of worms for herself and relive that? Does she want to reveal to her fans and the public that she fucked Harvey Weinstein for a big job? Of course not! She worked hard for where she is, she acts her ass off, she auditioned, she researched her roles. Somehow being given the option of a dick-suck instead of an audition is seen as a \"shortcut\" or a cheat.\n\n\nIn a way, for her peers, it is. If they turned down the same proposition, they feel they missed an opportunity they could have earned in the audition room. There's a twisted sort of self-loathing and regret for everyone involved. *Am I really jealous of an assault victim?* or *Would I give up this career to not be a victim?* It's all sorts of levels.\n\n\nReading Salma Hayek's story was one that really struck me. She worked on the Frida project, she did *everything* to get this movie made. Connected every dot, networked, got the funding, everything asked, and Weinstein keeps moving the goalposts. Finally the production is up and running, the cast and crew are working and Weinstein says \"Now have a threeway on camera or this entire thing gets shut down and it's your fault.\"\n\nWhat. The. Fuck.\n\n\nShe has to weigh her career and her dignity and her relationships with friends and coworkers and the whole passion project. It feels as if it's *all on her*. Just because some fat fuck wants to see her naked. Plenty of people hearing that would have told her not to worry about it, plenty too would have said just to do the scene.

The producers had assured the cast and crew that it was safe to film there. While they were shooting, a train came around a corner at 58 mph (93 km/h; 26 m/s), giving the crew less than a minute to evacuate from the location, a substantial way out onto the trestle. The only escape route was toward the oncoming train. Video of the crew indicates that they were unaware how fast it was approaching; some attempted to remove camera equipment and the metal bed from the trestle. They failed to remove the bed before the braking train rolled through, and many of the crew were trapped out on the trestle. The train struck and shattered the metal bed, sending shrapnel toward crew members. Fragments struck camera assistant Sarah Jones and propelled her toward the still fast moving train, resulting in her death.[1][2][3][4][5] William Hurt got off the trestle before the train hit the hospital bed. Several other crew members were injured and were taken to hospital.[6]\"\n\nThe cast and crew had been told by the producers that it was safe to shoot.\n\nHere's the follow up on the producer:\n\nIn 2014, during production of Miller's film Midnight Rider, camera assistant Sarah Jones was killed during the filming of a scene.[13] A police investigation concluded that Miller and crew were trespassing on an operating railway line.[14] Miller ultimately took a plea deal, pleading guilty to involuntary manslaughter, and serving a year in prison.[15][16] Miller is the first director to receive a prison sentence due to the death of a cast or crew member.[17] As part of his plea agreement he is prohibited from working as a director or assistant director or in any supervisory role that includes safety responsibility of a film production.[15]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randall_Miller\n\nHe did end up serving time for manslaughter after taking a plea deal.\n\nHe did it, because he thought it would cheaper than trying to get permission/insurance/etc, and thought he could just get that shot done before anyone knew what happened.\n\nThe sad part is that there are tons of abandoned railroad tracks everywhere. He easily could have set up a scene on a track in some back farmer's field, and nobody would have cared as it was a \"dream sequence.\"", "created_utc": 1517686639.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dtordyq", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7uzu4s", "parent_id": "t1_dtopqnl", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7uzu4s/this_is_why_uma_thurman_is_angry/dtordyq/", "score": 142, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Vio_", "author_id": "brxfa", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Man, poor Uma Thurman.
