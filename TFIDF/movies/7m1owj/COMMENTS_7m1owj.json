Disney is really wearing Star Wars thin, this is our 3rd Star Wars movie in 3 years, and we have Solo coming out in a few months for a 4th. This isn't the MCU, you can't just churn out a Star Wars movie every year for all eternity and not expect fatigue to set in. The Original Trilogy and the Prequel Trilogy were released four years apart to get the audience amped up and excited instead of flooding the market. This is why I'm not looking forward to the announced Rian Johnson trilogy after the Sequel trilogy wraps up. Disney wants this to be MCU profitable, but it's going to backfire on them IMO.\n\n2. They're treating the making of Star Wars like it's the MCU. They keep it simple, safe, joke filled etc. When someone watches a Star Wars movie there are check boxes that need to be filled. MCU movies don't have this because I go to them just to have fun, but with Star Wars I'm expecting something more: *Good* World-building, character arcs that make sense, etc. This is why people go see Star Wars. \n\n\nSo yeah these are other issues that Disney has with Star Wars imo.

Oh. Wait. Now to make our money back we have to shove ALL of that iconic stuff into the new trilogy.\" \n\nAnd here's the point: to do that, you have to make the trilogy be about Empire 2.0 vs Rebels 2.0.\n\nThis is the single most important creative decision in the trilogy, and it was decided for commercial reasons long before any director or writer was involved.\n\nThe problem is slightly clearer in TLJ than TFA but it's the same problem in both films. The galactic conflict between the ~~Empire~~ The First Order and the ~~Rebels~~ ~~The Resistance~~ New Rebels^?? is arbitrary nonsensical garbage made up because Disney bought themselves into a box of HAVING to make movies about stormtroopers and star destroyers.\n\nThe problems that OP pointed out with TLJ like lack of sense of scale (the entire \"Galactic Resistance\" is first trapped on one ship, then in one room), lack of context for the conflict (Snoke is never explained), plot holes (some rebels just take a break from being chased to death to go do a side mission), all come from the bad setup in TFA.\n\nEverybody agreed to give TFA a pass because the movie was \"palatable\" and \"felt like Star Wars\" but that movie didn't give any emotional urgency to why there had to be more story after the end of ROTJ or any rational explanation of how things went from Rebel victory to total reset back to ANH. \n\nThose two problems can no longer be papered over especially when this movie makes clear that for \"More Star Wars\" to happen, Luke Skywalker has to be a failure. He brought peace and freedom to the galaxy, for like fifteen minutes.\n\nYou could still probably edit TLJ down to a pretty interesting (and very well directed) TV show episode about Rey, Kylo and Luke.
