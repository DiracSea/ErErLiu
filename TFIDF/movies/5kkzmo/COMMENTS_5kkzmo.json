[{"body": "I got to meet her one year I was working backstage security at DragonCon here in Atlanta. I was standing around backstage while the room was being filled, checking in on our VIPs when Carrie came in with her crew. I knew one of her guest escorts so I said hi to him. He introduced me to Carrie and I told her how wonderful it was to meet her. She shook my hand and looked intently at my face. Then she pulled out a make-up case and a brush and started brushing something on to the left side of my face. I looked at Fritz, her escort, and he said, \"She's been doing this all day.\" Carrie grabbed my chin and turned my face back to her. She then finished COVERING the left side of my face with glitter, cocked her head to take a more critical view of her work, nodded, and went on to her next appearance. She never spoke to me the entire time but booped my nose as she walked away.\n\nI kept running into other people on the crew that day who had glitter dust on their faces. Everyone just smiled and said, \"Oh, you ran in to Carrie, too.\"\n\nSuper nice lady. She will definitely be missed.\n\nEDIT: Wow, my first Reddit Gold just for telling a cute little encounter. I just thought sharing that story might make a few people smile. My girlfriend got her picture taken with her the same weekend. Carrie showed up at a group Princess Leia cosplay photo and my girlfriend wound up right next to her.

From the reports, it sounded like Carrie Fisher suffered cardiac arrest, whereby the entire heart is affected - in most cases, the heart essentially \"stops\" - with severe consequences, often including cessation of breathing. I understand an EMT aboard the plane gave her CPR until landing which most definitely prolonged her life - well performed chest compressions can serve to deliver enough oxygen to the brain and vital organs to sustain life. Unfortunately, when the brain is deprived of oxygen for longer periods of time, the damage is more severe. The best outcome is mild brain damage. Rest in peace Carrie Fisher.
