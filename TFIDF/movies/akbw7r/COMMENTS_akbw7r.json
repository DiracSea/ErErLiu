Robert Cargill, one of the screenwriters who worked on Doctor Strange, spoke very bluntly about changes made to Stephen Strange's mentor in mysticism, the Ancient One. In the comics, the Ancient One is hundreds of years old and originates from the area that would later become known as Tibet, and Doctor Strange travels to Tibet to find him. Naturally, the Ancient One's original background was a bit of a sticking point for Marvel because, as Cargill explained:\n\n>The Ancient One was a racist stereotype who comes from a region of the world that is in a very weird political place. He originates from Tibet, so if you acknowledge that Tibet is a place and that he\u2019s Tibetan, you risk alienating one billion people who think that that\u2019s bulls**t and risk the Chinese government going, \u2018Hey, you know one of the biggest film-watching countries in the world? We\u2019re not going to show your movie because you decided to get political'...\n\n>Tibetan National Congress President Jigme Ugen commented, \"The whitewashing of #DrStrange is also kowtowing to #China to twist history.
