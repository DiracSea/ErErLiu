His secret? A deathly fear of water. When he's near a large body of water, his mind essentially shuts down and he curls up into a ball, seizes up, or just passes out. Of course, this allows him to have incredibly precise dives, but he still needs someone to fish him out afterwards. That role usually falls to his coach, Eddy Alvarez (John C. Reilly), who has given Josh mouth to mouth no fewer than two dozen times. Josh also has a potential love interest: his ex-girlfriend Allie (Jennifer Connelly), with who'm he's had an on-again, off-again relationship for the better part of a decade. They recently broke up again because Josh is an insufferable ass in the six-month period before every Olympic game.\n\nKaye's chief competitor is Norwegian diver Henrik Thorsbj\u00f8rg (Will Arnett), who claims he shall only \"associate his person\" with the water of his hometown of V\u00e5sfjord. Thankfully, it's the home of the Voss water bottle company, so he can travel around the world with a good supply to drink, cook, bathe, shower, and swim in at all times. Henrik also has a coach/manservant known simply as Jan (Dolph Lundgren) who does his bidding, usually keeping a towel and a bottle of water on standby.\n\nThe film's plot gets moving at the World Diving Championship Semifinals, whose top four will automatically be permitted to participate in the next Olympics. Josh and Henrik go up against one another, during which Henrik manages to barely edge out Josh for first place. Refusing to accept defeat, he talks to Eddy about overcoming his crippling aquaphobia. Eddy's doubtful, wondering if that'll harm his performance, but Josh insists. After an inspirational speech and a training montage, Josh progresses admirably, learning how to do the doggy paddle (with floaties, of course) after four months. He's even reconnected with Allie, his usual dickishness having completely gone away.\n\nThe qualifying finals for the Olympics come around, and... Josh is horrible. He can't stay in form, jumps off target, and even Manges to do a belly flop at one point. It's only a miracle that he proceeds to the Olympics, let alone not be disqualified, due to his very high earlier scores. Confronting Eddy, Josh admits that he seriously messed up and wants to unlearn everything. Although Eddy's disappointed that his inspirational speech was for nothing, he still agrees to undo the damage he did. So, he calls up an old friend: Karhyluwon, a Thai mystic who can magically alter people's state of mind.\n\nJosh arrives in a remote Thai monastery, only to find that Karhyluwon is not actually some ancient Thai sorcerer, but rather Carl (H. Jon Benjamin), Eddy's college roommate who had a midlife crisis and moved out to Asia a few years back. However, he still promises that he has learned powerful ways that'll easily reinstate Josh's fear of water. So, he carefully has Josh recline on the sacred plinth of serenity, cover his face with the holy cloth of enlightenment, and waterboards the everloving shit out of him with the jerry can of wisdom. This is combined in another montage with such pleasant acts as electroshock every time someone pour water, being dangled above a pool full of sharks, and being forced to listen to an endless loop of Barry Manilow (with no *Copacabana*) in one of those infinite wave pools. By the end of it, Josh returnes to his old self.\n\nFinally, the time of the Olympics is upon them. Josh is performing admirably, but Henrik still keeps just barely outperforming him. Being even more assholish than usual, Allie breaks up with him once again. Josh tries to rekindle their romance by appealing to her sense of humor, but it inevitably devolves into a series of worse and worse diving puns until she slams the door in his face. Meanwhile, Henrik has fired Jan, who he caught pouring Dasaniinto a Voss bottle. He meets up with Allie through Tinder, and they actually hit it off. Later, on one of their dates, Jan mentions that he changed the water in the bottles because something in the bottles \"make do damage Mister Henrik health if too much.\" Going off that hunch, Allie investigated Henrik's discarded bottles to find that they were laced with ADHD drugs, which what were allowed him to have such stillness while diving. Henrik is exposed and stripped of his medals, and Josh wins by default. He considers making a move to win back Allie but realizes that she's happier with Jan and doesn't deserve someone like himself.

This is his moment, his chance to win an Olympic gold medal. He is terrified as he moves to the edge of the diving board and when he reaches the edge he turns so his back is facing the pool. He spreads his arms. He is ready to jump. The crowd is silent, expectant. He is the favorite to win, he has been preparing for this moment his entire life.\n\nWe see him at seven years old. He is at a pool and his friends have dared him to jump off a high diving platform. He doesn\u2019t know how to swim but he doesn\u2019t back down from the dare. He climbs to the top and walks, terrified, to the edge of the diving board. He steps off and, amazingly, somersaults one and a half times and then enters straight into the water, arms above his head, hands placed perfectly. It is a thing of beauty. His friends stare open-mouthed. And then they realize he isn\u2019t coming to the surface. He is drowning. They shout for someone to save him. Suddenly a man jumps into the pool and pulls him out of the water, and gives him mouth to mouth, saving his life.\n\nSomeone has called his mother and she comes to the pool. The boy is sitting on a pool chair surrounded by his friends who are laughing and patting him on the back and saying things like that was amazing and how did you do that? The man who saved him is nearby and we see him give the boy a curious look. The mother runs over to her son and ask him if he is ok, she coddles him. Someone tells her the man saved her little boy\u2019s life and she thanks him. As she and her son walk to the car the man who saved him walks up to them. I am a professional diving trainer, he says, and your boy could be an olympic diving gold medalist. If he gets the training. He hands the mother a soggy business card and then gives the boy a knowing look, for he knows the boy cannot swim.\n\nFirst training lesson at an empty pool. He pushes the boy into the water. The boy starts flailing around and then the trainer extends a noodle to the boy who grabs it. The trainer reveals to the boy (who is still hanging onto the noodle for dear life) his theory that the boy\u2019s ability to dive is based on his fear of drowning. That as he falls, his fear will allow him to maintain a rigid form as he enters the water and when he hits he will barely make a splash. So, he says, that will be your strength, that is what will make you a world champion diver. You must never learn how to swim.\n\nBut, the boy asks, what happens after I dive into the water?\n\nWell, I\u2019ll jump in and save you.\n\nWe see a montage of him training, winning high school competitions with the coach jumping into the water and saving him each time. Maybe a Michael Phelps cameo. Then we see commercials and news interviews with him as he prepares for the Olympics.\n\nNow, weeks before the Olympics, he is jogging on a path by a cliff overlooking a lake and suddenly he hears a woman screaming below. He looks down and sees her in the water and without thinking he jumps off the cliff, somersaults five times, a perfect dive. He lands right next to her and immediately starts drowning. She is so astonished that in a burst of strength she saves them both and drags him to land. She drags him to her car and brings him to her cabin nearby and tends to him and they make love and the next day she teaches him how to swim. He knows he shouldn\u2019t learn how to swim but he is falling in love with her and can\u2019t say no. It has been nearly three days since he\u2019s gone missing and his coach has filed a missing person\u2019s report and suddenly a helicopter comes roaring over them as they sit on the beach. He is spotted and returns to training. But he is distracted, he is in love, and now he knows how to swim. He tells his coach none of these things.\n\nHis coach knows something has changed. But the coach isn\u2019t sure what and then after one practice dive, and before the coach can save him, he is suddenly swimming. His coach tries to make him forget how to swim, they throw him into the middle of the ocean, they try hypnosis, but nothing works. His coach gives up and instead tries to teach him how to dive like a normal person, but they can\u2019t seem to get it right.\n\nWe see him where the movie started, back at the Olympics, arms outstretched, ready to jump, ready to win an Olympic gold medal. He is terrified, but this time it is not of drowning, but of failing. And then suddenly he sees her in the crowd. And then he imagines her as he first saw her, drowning in the lake. And somehow that unlocks his ability. He is smiling as he jumps.\n", "created_utc": 1481414550.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "db1etxp", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_5hkwqt", "parent_id": "t1_db1b7s1", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/5hkwqt/since_will_ferrell_is_going_to_continue_his/db1etxp/", "score": 223, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Befriendjamin", "author_id": "1328py", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Too subtle for the Hollywood shills, no doubt.
