By the end, I was crying, shocked at how much I became invested in the story. So much passion and creativity in every frame of the movie. I got a very Studio Ghibli vibe from the whole thing. My only regret is not seeing it on the big screen. I'll say it again, it's a masterpiece, and one of the greatest animated films I've ever seen.\n\nEdit: I love the passion this movie has generated! It's okay if you didn't like it as much as I did, and I find a lot of the replies I got from people who loved it were from parents. I think the view of parenthood frames this movie differently; I probably wouldn't have liked it as much even 10 years ago. Thanks for all the replies and movie recommendations!", "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "title": "\"Kubo and the Two Strings\" is an absolute masterpiece.", "url": null, "author_name": "Azureknight205", "author_id": "8q025", "subreddit_name": "movies", "upvote_ratio": 0.77}
