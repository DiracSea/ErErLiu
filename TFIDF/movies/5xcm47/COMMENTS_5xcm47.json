(if perhaps less so than the first).\n\nI do not want an action movie, I do not want some big climax, I don't want stupid modern jokes or songs that will date the movie five minutes after it's release. if they just focus on making it a good movie it could very easily be a classic like the first one.\n\nOf course, instead of being *Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There* it could be *Alice in Wonderland (2010).* (Or even worse, *The Smurfs 2/Squeakquel* level) and if we are being honest with ourselves that is *likely* what it is going to end up being. but a man can always hope.\n\nI still hope every-time that they will actually go through the effort to make something decent, and reap the rewards of doing that. but they never do, apparently throwing in stupid modern references and pop songs in everything sells more than actually making good movies nowadays. it makes me sad.", "created_utc": 1488585260.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1488585462.0, "id": "dehb9kb", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_5xcm47", "parent_id": "t1_deh7vrw", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/5xcm47/first_official_image_of_emily_blunt_from_mary/dehb9kb/", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Why not?
