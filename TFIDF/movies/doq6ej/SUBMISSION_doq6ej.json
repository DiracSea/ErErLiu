I never ever gave thought to the fact main characters were females.  \nIn terms of music (out of subject), I could listen to Avril Lavigne all day long. it was great. But as well as Sum 41, metallica and Iron Maiden.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Those days were great, marketing wise, if a film or any piece of art involved a women. you wouldn't judge quality with gender in the equation. no one would sell you the gender. You wouldn't even think about the gender of the artist. But marketing is evolving...*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne hour ago, I just watched Ocean's eight followed by Ghostbuster (2016). I can tell you it left me with a bad aftertaste.  \nThose films were so focused on replacing men that i can not fathom the point of it all.  \nIf it was meant to empower women, well, it's a fail.\n\n**One doesn't empower women by forcefully adding wo- in front of any men/man in a pile of books/scripts.**\n\n**This Wo-wo- syndrom needs to stop.**\n\nIf we want to empower women **we need to tell the tales of women**, forge great stories about them. Women don't need to be anything else than women in the movie industry to be great. T**hey are no substitute or just a smiling sexy face representing a target market.** we don't need to replace men heroes with women to make them great.\n\n**They are amazing human being that can be heroes of their own.**\n\nEDIT : How can this be a controversial subject. Are we redditors on the IDGAF / sexist / tilted sides ?\n\nEDIT 2 : Wow. This blew up. my inbox is dead. But i'll try to give a look at every single answers\n\nEDIT 3 : [gibsonlespaul](https://www.reddit.com/user/gibsonlespaul/) & other redditors gave a few interesting movie titles with \"strong/fully fleshed out female characters\" in the comments it's worth checking :)", "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "title": "I'd rather have great women stories than lazy Gender Reversal packaged in women empowerment.", "url": null, "author_name": "PopularityIsUseless", "author_id": "3hx9utmg", "subreddit_name": "movies", "upvote_ratio": 0.76}
