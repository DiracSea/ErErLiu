[{"body": "**Films on follow list with updates**\n\n* **Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle** - In what is still the craziest box office run ever, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle has now passed $900M worldwide worldwide, a 10x return on it's $90M budget and means the film is in the top 50 worldwide releases of all time. If you predicted that 6 months ago you are officially a witch and you should please help we win the lottery.\n\n**Films not on follow list with updates**\n\n* **The Greatest Showman** - Speaking of insane runs, the little $84M circus musical that could sadly dropped out of the top 5 this weekend after 8 straight weeks, but it did manage to make $5.1M at #6. The film now stands at $154.4M domestic which is more than the domestic gross of La La Land, making The Greatest Showman the 4th highest grossing musical in history. In other news, nothing makes sense anymore but I'm enjoying it!\n\n**Notable film closings** \n\n* **Daddy's Home 2** - Despite coming out at possibly the worst possible moment for a film to be released with a problematic lead, Daddy's Home 2 was not tanked for it's inclusion of Mel Gibson as the film closed to a solid $104M domestic and $180.6M on a budget of $69M. Despite the possible repercussions of coming out at the start of MeToo movement and the film moving away from the post Star Wars weekend (which Jumanji took are rode so well), it still managed to pass $100M but came nowhere close to the $150M domestic haul of the first film. Still it's a pretty solid scorer though with each film carrying a budget of $69M (that has to be on purpose) the dwindling returns may not put much faith in a Daddy's Home 3: Revenge of the Daddy. \n\n* **Father Figures** - Wait, is this a real movie? [*googles poster*](https://cdn.flickeringmyth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Father-Figures-poster.jpg) Okay that is DEFINITELY not a real movie...it is? You sure? Well I guess so cause it closed to a very bad $17.5M domestic and $23M worldwide on a budget of $25M. But it doesn't exist so doesn't really matter. Yeah sure, like a movie would star Glenn Close AND Katt Williams.

However, if it's the case that people's expectations are raised, you should see multipliers generally trending down while the opening generally trends up.\n\nSeries | Original | Sequel | Sequel^2\n|--|--|--|--\nIron Man| 102|128|174\nCaptain America|65|95|179\nThor|65|85|122\nAvengers|207|191|\nGotG|94|146\n\nI'm ambivalent on Black Panther's multiplier, though. I don't expect it to be Wonder Woman level. That was a breath of fresh air from the DC Comics wasteland. The cultural pull of Black Panther is also for a smaller segment of the population than Wonder Woman. Fathers could bring daughters to WW and that's two more tickets; you won't have that same effect with Black Panther. \n\nBlack Panther got *so* much hype and so many good reviews that we're all expecting it to be great and it's not going to catch people by surprise. There's also a rush to see it early because it is viewed as a cultural moment, which will inflate the opening numbers and decrease the multiplier. If I had to guess, I'd say probably 2.5, maybe a bit below?\n\nI don't think Marvel will care about the distribution of the box office take because... well, a 2.5x would be $500M domestic and that's more than enough to justify sequels with cash left over for the hourly money fights I'm sure they have. \n\n", "created_utc": 1519062843.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dui077u", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7yntae", "parent_id": "t1_duhv3fn", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7yntae/box_office_week_black_panther_smashes_at_1_with/dui077u/", "score": 57, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "TheCavis", "author_id": "4b30v", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I was very surprised there was no Infinity War trailer before my Black Panther showing.", "created_utc": 1519074827.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "duicgsw", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7yntae", "parent_id": "t1_dui0qqe", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7yntae/box_office_week_black_panther_smashes_at_1_with/duicgsw/", "score": 59, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "serefina", "author_id": "dcq2h", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "\"...and get this man a shield!\"", "created_utc": 1519080359.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "duii1pn", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7yntae", "parent_id": "t1_dui0qqe", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7yntae/box_office_week_black_panther_smashes_at_1_with/duii1pn/", "score": 11, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "ChocolateAmerican", "author_id": "bq6mi", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Agreed, I actually thought he was the best part of the film.\n\nSo many other Marvel villians are cookie-cutter and 1-dimensional.

Most of he flashbacks center on the villain and the movie does a lot to develop his motivations. The film is more of an ensemble piece with the title character not even present for large chunks of the film. A few different genres are mashed up in this here to the point it feels like a completely different move in parts. It borrows from Bond, Game of Thrones, and all sorts of other media. Aside from a couple jokes from the more excitable characters, Black Panther is mostly dead serious. T'Challa changes the whole philosophy of himself and his nation. The villain changes the entire course of history for what may be the entire MCU. Black Panther gives you *a lot* to think about after the film and has some important things to say about race and politics, but without being preachy. There's also a strong emotional core to the film that we haven't really seen in a Marvel movie, or maybe any superhero movie.

But they kept going anyway.\n\nSuicide Squad...happened? I have no idea why anybody thought it was a good idea to roll a villain movie this early on in the universe. I have no idea why they thought going with Jared Leto's Joker was a good idea, especially less than a decade out from Heath Ledger's award-winning performance. I know why they did reshoots, but that somehow made it even worse because they basically sacrificed anything resembling a style and thematics to create something universally acceptable, and failed.\n\nWonder Woman. Finally, a ray of light. Unfortunately, it was so divorced from the rest of the universe that it really just spawned it's own franchise as opposed to fixing the DCEU mess. But we had hope, and as we all know, rebellions are built on hope.\n\nJustice League is where it became clear that the experiment had solidly failed. Zack Snyder is *still involved* despite not having been able to output a well-received movie yet, only leaving late in production due to personal issues. Amazingly, however, him leaving seemed to make the movie *worse* as Whedon reshot a significant portion of the movie in an entirely different style that made it plainly apparent that we were watching the Frankenstein's monster of two different people's work. Add to that the fact that we had to origin story out three characters who hadn't appeared yet outside of a couple of ten second GIFs along with resurrecting Superman (who's dead for literally no reason other than Zack wanted to superglue a shitty Death of Superman adaptation to the end of his other movie) *and* establishing and defeating a threat in your standard team-up movie plot. And Warner Bros. in their infinite wisdom decided that BvS' running time was the problem, so all this had to be done in under two hours.\n\nIs it any wonder that it didn't work? Justice League could have been a good film, and was possible even a decent one despite all of this, but it had every possible card stacked up against it.\n\nNow look at MCU Phase 1. Only one more movie than the DCEU, but it accomplished so much more. Iron Man 1 establishes Tony Stark and gets things rolling. The Incredible Hulk starts mopping up the previous terrible Hulk movies and reestablishes him (though Hulk winds up getting recast later on). Iron Man 2 furthers Tony's story and establishes War Machine, Black Widow, and more SHIELD stuff. Thor establishes Thor, Loki, Hawkeye, and starts teasing the plot elements for Avengers. Captain America establishes Captain America, lays the groundwork for HYDRA and Bucky's return in Phase 2, and sets up the rest of the groundwork for Avengers. And then we hit Avengers, and everyone is already introduced and most of the plot elements are already in play. It's a master class of how to properly build up to a team-up movie.\n\nWhich makes the DCEU even *more* disappointing.

There aren't a lot of people who actually relate to unhinged detective, an all-powerful alien who has to push back against his own power, or an Amazon queen, so those characters need a lot more love and work to make them something people can feel a part of themselves in and love. DC can do wonders in longer-format media, such as comics and TV series, because they have the time to focus on how Clark Kent feels like an alien and outsider, and movies that focused on these characters in a human light would probably do better.
