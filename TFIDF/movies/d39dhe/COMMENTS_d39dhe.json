Electrician, specifically. And this whole thing fucking boggles my mind and I have soooo many questions.\n\nFirst, all I can think about is the amount of safety measures and precautions we are REQUIRED to take in my workplaces, and the kind of consequences the companies responsible suffer when they fail to meet those requirements. If OSHA is tipped off or independently sniffs out a problem on a site, they're allowed to fine the company or companies responsible up to a maximum of something like $12,600 PER DAY until they correct that problem. And that can be regardless of whether or someone is hurt or killed. In some cases, like in the case of a fatality, it should definitely be higher. I remember reading a year or two ago, they fined The Walking Dead production company that maximum fine when a stuntman died on set. But that's a one time thing. One day, I guess...even though, ya know, that person is going to remain dead EVERY SINGLE day from then on and his loved ones have to deal with that. But I guess that's not OSHAs responsibility. Either way, that sucks.\n\nThen where does the Bureau of Workers Compensation fit in here? I know it varies state to state, but still. During my first year of my apprenticeship, I was being extremely stupid, stripping a cable very incorrectly with a fresh blade in my utility knife, sliced my hand open pretty deep, and required a drug test, and then shots and then 12 or 13 stitches or something. Now that was me being stupid, I did it to myself, and I'm solely to blame...but workers compensation covered all that because it was on the job. So where are they for this stuntwoman?\n\nAnd then aren't film industry workers unionized? Only some? I know at least in my industry, labor unions get so far up companies and governments asses when they're wronging the common worker somehow, so where are they?\n\nAnd this company's insurance policy isn't covering all of this woman's medical expenses and that's okay? What the fuck? Shouldn't this company somehow be legally responsible for having an insurance policy to cover 100% of all this if they're doing anything that can seriously injure or KILL somebody? Shit, we had this customer buy a chandelier from a store that was closing and they required that she have it removed by a licensed electrical contractor with proof of at least a $2 million insurance policy. And let me tell ya, that chandelier maybe 60 lbs at best, and 2 of us got it down with 8' ladders in about 15 minutes and had little to no chance of hurting anyone or anything short of maybe falling off the ladder (which was our company's problem, not the store) or maybe dropping it a cracking a floor tile. But $2 million insurance policy.\n\nAnyway. This shit is all kinds of fucked up. Sure, she should sue the living piss out of this company.

A production isn't set up to just throw stunt shots into the day willy-nilly. I'm not sure exactly what happened here, but I think there must be more to it than the official story. \n\nSecond, a film's insurance doesn't cover stunts typically. You have to get a separate policy specifically for that. \n\nThird, a stunt coordinator has to be involved with the entire production and they would have to have knowledge of every time a stunt occurs. They would be largely responsible for setting it up.\n\nFourth, the UPM (unit production manager) would have to know exactly what they were doing as it's mostly their job to make sure everything is done to ensure there's no unnecessary cost or production delay incurred by adding something to the day. \n\nTo get to your question, when we do a shot where someone \"charges the camera\", there are a handful of ways to do it safely. \n\nThe easiest thing is just to plot a path where the stunt person veers off to one side and misses the camera by a fairly narrow margin. Usually the best bet with high speeds. The camera rig is usually outfitted in such a way that it would not severely injure the stunt person if the mark is missed (pads, angled surfaces to deflect, etc). \n\nAnother way is a pulley if you want them to pass under it. You have a person holding onto the rig via a rope and they can pull it up once the stunt person hits a carefully monitored mark. \n\nOr, you have the camera on something like a tripod dolly, and pull it out of the way when they pass the mark. \n\nIt's not that crane shots of this manner never happen, but they're usually carefully coordinated and rehearsed, and not typically done with an unprotected rider flying at it. She could have hit the camera in any other situation and probably not receive such a severe injury because in the situations I detailed above, she wouldn't be coming into contact with something mounted to a crane.

They tell the director what is safe and he has to decide what he needs for the shot. A true stunt coordinator has no problem telling a director something is not safe and a 1st AD will immediately back them up and say if coordinator says it\u2019s not safe then they won\u2019t do it. But it\u2019s hard to really tell without being there what went wrong.
