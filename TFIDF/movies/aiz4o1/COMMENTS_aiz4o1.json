A very famous example of course being Jimmy Saville who got away with all sorts of horrific shit his entire life and people knew.\n\nBut our university had a relatively open secret too, and that was how much of an indecent pervert one of the lecturers was. He was consistently incredibly inappropriate with students and there were many stories about him. One student had to go on a trip up the country with him (for a conference maybe? I can't remember), the lecturer was driving the van and he kept on inappropriately stroking the students thigh. They also had to share a one bed hotel and again there was more inappropriate touching that led the student to sleep on the floor or sofa.\n\nThis was just one of many stories people had (I'd heard that story directly from the student in question). I'd never had many run ins with the lecturer but he was openly very creepy towards most young men. In one lesson he was attaching a microphone to my clothes and began stroking my arms and it was incredibly strange and obviously incredibly inappropriate.\n\nBut the craziest part is what went down one summers evening when me and a few friends decided to have some drinks on a nearby field. He decided to join in. And of course, everyone got very drunk. Including, obviously, the lecturer in question. And his inappropriate touching was off the scale. He was all over two of my friends, literally forcing his hands down the pants of them at times, and it was all just beyond belief. None of us could really believe what was happening, most of it was covered up by nervous laughter. You could tell how uncomfortable those who were being fondled were but they were also just nervously laughing and not quite knowing what to do.\n\nIt was a fucking wierd evening, and no one ever decided to do anything about it. It's just one of those stories we occasionally bring up like \"what the fuck was that about\". \n\nBut that's how these people get away with it, and it's absolutely insane. People just tolerate, in silence and often shock. I've suggested that people take it further but people aren't interested.

The Oscars have always been this way--it's more about who makes money and who can make or break careers than artistry. Weinstein-produced movies got nominated for tons of awards when they were flush with cash. Even in the 30s and 40s, the \"Big Five\" studios of MGM, Paramount, Fox, Warner Brothers, and RKO dominated the awards while the \"Little Three\" of Universal, Columbia, and United Artists could barely get nominated outside of Frank Capra's movies. \n\nDisney was the biggest cartoon studio and MGM was the biggest movie studio overall, and the two studios combined won something like 19 of the first 20 Best Cartoon awards (MGM mostly for Tom and Jerry cartoons) while Betty Boop, Superman and Looney Tunes were lucky to even get nominated, despite the fact they were often better cartoons than what won, and transformed what cartoons and comedy became. But they were too risqu\u00e9 and Disney and MGM made more money so they won all the awards. It got so bad that Leon Schlesinger, original owner of the Looney Tunes studio, threatened to boycott his cartoons for future consideration because he thought they were rigged. He backed down, and suddenly his studio was nominated every year as they expanded the number of nominees but Looney Tunes still never won until after Schlesinger sold the studio to Warner Brothers.\n\nIf you're looking at the Oscars for \"best\" anything, you're really looking in the wrong place, though I do agree that the awards got worse once they expanded the number of Best Picture nominees to ten about a decade ago. Tastes are subjective, but for a few years in the early '10s, I would try to watch all the nominees from all the major categories plus all the un-nominated movies that had regularly shown up on critics' top ten lists compiled at Metacritic, and every year I came away with: not only did the best movies usually fail to get nominated at all, but the best movies/performances that *were* nominated usually failed to win. I got sick of it after a few years, and gave up on watching those \"Oscar worthy\" movies.\n\nSo I wouldn't say this year is any different. It's more of the same of the recent past, and, really, it's pretty much the same as it's always been.
