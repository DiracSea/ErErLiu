And he did try to follow up on his threats. \n\nLouis CK didn't threaten anyone (EDIT: I'll add as far as we know at this point, with this ever growing scandal, who knows what will come out tomorrow, but so far, his behavior is really not what Weinstein engaged in).\n\nBecause someone reads an implied threat where there is none, doesn't mean that it's reasonable to believe it. Like, I could feel scared because a black guy is following me on the street. I could feel an implied threat. It's not fair to assume this just because he's black, in fact it would make me a racist. Whether or not I *feel* the threat has little to do with whether there *is* a threat. My *feelings* do not make *you* a perpetrator of what I *feel*. \n\nYour actions, and your *intentions* count. This is why murder and manslaughter are different charges with different punishments even though both can be from you being on the firing side of a gun and a dead guy on the other. Also it's why you can get charged with attempted murder though a gun never had any bullets in it. Your *intent* to kill is what gets you in trouble there.\n\nBy your rules, as soon as you're a CEO you're out of the dating market forever. If you're a politician, forget it. No sex for you because you have real connections to power. So everything you do is an implied threat. \n\nYou can't even order breakfast because someone can say oh he's powerful, I better give this breakfast to him for free or else he's going to try to ruin me.\n\nThere *has* to be a *reasonable* belief behind it being a threat. Not just because he's connected or powerful. Any express threat, or any other reason to believe that he might act. Being a man, having money or power, is not any *reasonable* reason to believe that you will destroy someone's life or fuck with their job, any more than it's reasonable to believe that because a black guy is walking in a white neighborhood it's because he's there to steal something. \n\n\n\n\n", "created_utc": 1510324771.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1510325011.0, "id": "dpmdsem", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7bypdq", "parent_id": "t1_dpmbale", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7bypdq/lapd_forming_task_force_to_investigate_sexual/dpmdsem/", "score": 12, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "\u0412\u043c\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0435 \u043c\u044b \u0441\u0438\u043b\u0430", "created_utc": 1510313323.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dpm77b1", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7bypdq", "parent_id": "t1_dpm73ck", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7bypdq/lapd_forming_task_force_to_investigate_sexual/dpm77b1/", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "GetEquipped", "author_id": "huyfv", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Also they didn't kill the women (fortunately) even though they shot the truck 107 times.", "created_utc": 1510329282.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dpmhow7", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7bypdq", "parent_id": "t1_dpmdenn", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7bypdq/lapd_forming_task_force_to_investigate_sexual/dpmhow7/", "score": 54, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Beingabummer", "author_id": "9ca77", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Gunna go out on a limb and say that this /s is not necessary.

Obviously, it's illegal, it is a sexual crime (lewd, indecent exposure, around minors, whatever laws might apply here), and there's a sexual context, but he's not directing it at anyone. If he's masturbating in a park while leering at a group of 14 year old girls, that's sexual harassment. There's intent, sexual context, and a subject the act is directed at.\n\nIf your roommate is taking a shower and you accidentally walk in, there's no sexual harassment. If your roommate is purposefully trying to get you to \"walk in on them\" by leaving the bathroom door ajar, being very quiet, maybe posing suggestively, and their intent is that you see them naked for their own sexual gratification, that's sexual harassment. The intent is different.\n\nIn the Chris Pratt situation, there's no sexual context, there is a subject, and there's no (I think it's safe to assume, given the context and the audience in the room) sexual intent.
