Edit - there are other links some have sent, so scratch this one. \n\nThat kickstarter claims a lot of media and news coverage, but those links seem dead, and the little info I find is only related to the movie. And still, with their zero budget, they claimed to have access to/permission from Wrinkles, something none of the media outlets seemed to have had/cared about. \n\nEverything I find in the wikipedia article about wrinkles was uploaded 5 days ago, it mentions older sites and articles (e.g. stuff from 2015) but provides no links to them. Edit- someone gave a couple of links from 2015, still 2 years later after the fad had started.\n\nThe wikipedia page for the clown craze and sightings has no mention of Wrinkles.\n\nSounds to me like they're latching onto the craze, claiming they started it and that it's \"all real\" but it was just material for the movie planted in advance. \n\nYes, the kids/teens look super fake cause they are fake.\n\nFurthermore: the original craze started in a 2013 with young filmmakers trying to build up marketing for their site. And it's not the only movie to come out of the craze, Gags the clown is another movie with a similar premise and a similar guerrilla campaign. \n\nThe movie has writers credited and is said in marketing releases to be influenced by Slender Man and The Blair Witch Project, and urban legends in general.\n\nIt's kinda silly, because while a \"it's a true story!\" angle is not a sin for a horror movie, trying to pass it off as real in this age where stuff can be so easily debunked makes you sound silly and it detracts from the horror a bit.

The hospital is all in english and everyone speaks english. But they would always when they mention where they are would say \"which is in brazil\" or \"of course as everyone knows is in brazil\". Like in s4 they did this [scene](https://youtu.be/U05GsUFp49A) and the pay off was hilarious. They had a whole episode where it takes place in a British version with an entirely different cast and the main clown character became a french mime no one liked.  \n\nSome episodes treated Blake the clown as a second class citizen no one liked was my main point before I went off topic and I couldn't find the relevant clip.
