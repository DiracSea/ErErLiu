People will organize into their specialities and get shit done. \n\nThis is the sad irony with climate change.  As a disaster, it is too slow and too diffuse for it to sort of trigger that wonderful disaster response that humans do so well.  You have people coopting it and trying to smother the reaction (because money), and other people failing to grasp it's reality, and so we fail to cohere around a unified purpose. \n\nBut almost every disaster in human history, we see these very similar displays of heroism play out.

This largely eliminates galvanic corrosion. Most molten salt designs envision using a low chromium, high nickel specialty steel called Alloy N for the surfaces contacting the fluoride salts. But after the MSRE, ORNL did a series of experiments with stainless steel and fluorides salts. Some of these tests ran for 45,000 hours (5 plus years). The tests showed that, provided the salt was free of impurities and maintained in a reducing condition, the effective SUS316 corrosion rate was about 0.025 mm/year.15 In other words, an extra 1 mm thickess is worth about 40 years.

The term \"mil\" is not an abbreviation but a unit of measure.\n\n\n----------------\n\n\n**Tellurium and neutron embrittlement and cracking of the Hastelloy-n was mitigated by the addition of a small amount of niobium.**\n\n\n\nhttp://moltensalt.org.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/references/static/downloads/pdf/ORNL-TM-6002.pdf\n\n*(please note this is hosted on moltensalt.org but was a paper from Oakridge National Lab about the MSRE)*\n\n(page 22)\n\nSUMMARY\n\nAs a result of these studies, we have found that Hastelloy N exposed\nin salt containing metal tellurides such as Li Te and Cr Te undergoes\ngrain boundary embrittlement like that observed in the MSRE. The\nembrittlement is a function of the chemical activity of tellurium\nassociated with the telluride. The degree of embrittlement can be\nreduced by alloying additions to the Hastelloy N. The addition of 1 to\n2 at. % Nb significantly reduces embrittlement\n\n\n...\n\n\nWe have found that if the U(IV)/U(III) ratio in fuel salt is kept\nbelow about 60, embrittlement is essentially prevented when CrTel.266\nis used as the source of tellurium.\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\nhttp://moltensalt.org/references/static/downloads/pdf/ORNL-TM-5920.pdf\n\n*(please note this is hosted on moltensalt.org but was a paper from Oakridge National Lab about the MSRE)*\n\npage 16\n\ndata shows that niobium improves the resistance of Hastelloy N to irradiation embrittlement\n\n\npage 31\n\nOur findings suggest very strongly that a molten-salt reactor could be constructed of 1 - to 2%-Nb-modified Hastelloy N and operated very satisfactorily at 650\u00b0C.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------\n\nhttp://samofar.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Progress-in-TMSR-Materials-Research%E2%80%94%E2%80%94Hefei-Huang.pdf\n\n\n\nhttp://world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Molten-salt-reactor-research-develops-class-of-all\n\n\nChina claims to have solved the corrosion issue.", "created_utc": 1572740999.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "f69ey7s", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_dqkgiq", "parent_id": "t1_f69dhxc", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/dqkgiq/ken_watanabes_fukushima_50_preparing_worldwide/f69ey7s/", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "espresso__patronum", "author_id": "n59q8", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Oh, well ignore all that dumb shit I said about humanity and the spirit of achievement or whatever.", "created_utc": 1572748629.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "f69wh0w", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_dqkgiq", "parent_id": "t1_f67o7f7", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/dqkgiq/ken_watanabes_fukushima_50_preparing_worldwide/f69wh0w/", "score": 20, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "M_Messervy", "author_id": "2jgrbvtg", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I remember him.
