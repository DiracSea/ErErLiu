The director's cut is almost always worth the time with him, and the theatrical release is almost always disappointing because WB's afraid you're going to ask for a ticket refund because you drank too much soda and missed the special effects from the trailer or something.\n\n---\n\nFor anyone interested, here's some Director's Cut differences. Wrote this up for a different discussion, but it fits here, I think.\n\n**From [Phil Owens' article on The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/batman-v-superman-extended-cut-adds-in-all-the-scenes-that-make-it-make-sense-commentary/) (spoiler tagged, in case anyone cares):**\n\n>In the theatrical cut, the whole thing with Lois\u2019 trip to Africa and the subsequent framing of Superman for some murders there seemed like a weird tangent because it never went anywhere and there was never any explanation given for why anyone thought Superman had randomly murdered some civilians. [In the Ultimate Edition, the trip becomes the entire lynchpin for the story, as it folds into Lexcorp\u2019s larger ploy to destroy Superman.](#spoiler)\n\n>[It turns out Lex Luthor\u2019s people had paid that woman to lie that Superman committed those murders, essentially to mess with him and give him some self-doubt. Lois does more journalism and unravels this greater plot \u2014 including the hugely important fact that Superman couldn\u2019t have known that Wallace Keefe\u2019s wheelchair was filled with explosives because it was lined with lead, and his X-ray vision can\u2019t see through lead. It\u2019s a ploy that we can actually make sense of with the evidence at hand, instead of by filling in the gaps.](#spoiler)\n\n>We also have more Superman and Clark Kent in general. I knew the theatrical cut hated him \u2014 it actively tries to prevent you from understanding him as a person and thus cuts off any attempts to empathize with what he\u2019s doing. But it turns out the theatrical version of the film hated him even more than I realized, given the scenes that were restored for the Ultimate Edition. [Here we have several scenes of Clark going out and doing journalism.](#spoiler)\n\n>We have what might be the most important scene in the entire movie for Superman as a person: [After the bombing at the Senate hearing, he actually helps people in this version instead of simply flying away. He stands outside, surveying the carnage, feeling immense guilt about not being able to save them. His comment to Lois, included in the theatrical version, about how he couldn\u2019t prevent the bombing because he wasn\u2019t trying to, holds emotional weight rather than communicating apathy. Lois\u2019 later discovery about the wheelchair being lined with lead means Supes was outplayed, not that he didn\u2019t care.](#spoiler)\n\n**Stuff I noticed that Phil didn't mention:**\n\n[There's a scene showing Superman finding distaste for Batman because there's news of Batman himself instigating gang violence; he brands criminals with a bat, and other criminals attack them when they land up in prison.](#spoiler)  \nLater in the film, [we see Luthor's lackey paying off inmates to attack bat-branded criminals; not enough strategic-Lex stirring the pot in the theatrical cut, imo.](#spoiler)\n\nRe: \"Martha\"  \nDuring their fight scene:  \n[*\"I bet your parents taught you that you mean something, that you're here for a reason.  \nMy parents taught me a different lesson, dying in the gutter for no reason at all.  \nThey taught me the world only makes sense if you force it to.\"*  \nAnd then, after they're both thinking about parents being in trouble, and Superman looks to be losing a chance to save a human being that he loves & cares for; \"Martha.\"](#spoiler)  \nOn Batman's reaction: [Take it as an adrenaline-filled half-thought of *the alien knows about mom?!* or just as an emotional trigger for a man that tries & fails to save his parents every night for his entire adult life, *whatever*. At least it didn't come out of nowhere, and whether or not you like it at this point, you should at least be able to see how it makes sense as a complete scene.](#spoiler)\n\nIt's not a perfect 10/10, but it's definitely an entertaining, re-watchable movie that I felt was totally worth my time.

It was impossible, and as a result of it being impossible I just started shooting the movie with most of it not prepped at all. You\u2019re going on to a set and you\u2019re winging it, you\u2019ve got these massively complicated scenes, no storyboards and you\u2019re making it up there and then on the spot.\n\nI can't remember where I read it, but I'm almost certain Peter Jackson said he called for the third movie because they had no idea how to actually do the big battle at the end and that they needed time to put that together that they did not have for the second movie.\n\nEDIT:  actually I think this is speaking about that from the same article:\n\n>Eventually, Jackson called off the shoot to finally clear his head and work things out properly, giving the team a year to revisit the situation.
