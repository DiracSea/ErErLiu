I can't tell you how many times I'd hear about a movie that was discussed over drinks.  \n\nWhen I heard about this case, it was quickly dismissed because the stories were different enough.  I think that's just a Hollywood thing.  If a movie is even slightly different, it's fair game.  I think both of those facts lead to things like Happy Feet and Surfs Up coming up around the same time.  A guy goes around pitching penguin movies and a few people decide to go make their own.  It seems really messed up, but at the same time I think ideas at that level are cheap and its the implementation that's the true value.

Every single deskman can tell from at least half of a story if they want to pay for it and even still if the rest isn't what you told them they don't have to pay because the contract wasn't filled on your part so there isn't really any risk for them if they agree to pay for a story that seems like it could be worth it. After the contract is written though there is really no reason to be afraid they will break it just to take the story from you. It is a shitty practice but most editors aren't complete assholes.\n\nJust remember to leave the juicy bits out from the copy you send but still describe them. If you tell you have an interview of Oprah confessing to murder, I guarantee I personally will make my editor buy the story and tapes from you. The lawyers are going to have a field day making that contract iron clad though.\n\nThere are also couple of other ways to protect you ideas but it depends heavily, what kind of stuff you are writing.
