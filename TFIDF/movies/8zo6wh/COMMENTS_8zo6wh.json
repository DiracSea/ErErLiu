Either that or you don\u2019t get their content. WB did it with lord of the rings too. It\u2019s not just single screen theaters, every run of every standard release is a minimum 2 week release. \n\nGenerally the longer a theater runs a film the more of the box office take they get. So week one it\u2019s 90/10 week 2 80/20. The problem is single screen theaters have no leverage against major studios if they have a nice slate. So Disney can force you to run something, or even keep something on a screen, or they can deny you future films. If you\u2019re a single screen theater you want the top earner for every week so right now Disney is King. And why monopolies are bad. \n\nLarge chains like AMC have move leverage. This is why day-and-date (I\u2019d rather pay $50 and watch it at home opening weekend that go to a theater) isn\u2019t happening for major releases. Every time a studio tries AMC and Regal say \u201cwe won\u2019t show that movie in any theater if you do day and date\u201d. And the circle jerk goes on. \n\nThe other way it goes is this, A studio has an absolute bomb coming, everyone knows it because all the distributors see the movies in advance and the tracking data is almost always on point. The studio will ask a theater to leave a bomb on the screen for some future incentive. Like 80/20 opening weekend of a highly anticipated film instead of 90/10. Or they will agree to not send a film to a rival theater across town. There\u2019s also a lot of rules that studios follow in terms of distance a film can play from itself. So let\u2019s say you got a 3plex and a 2 plex in town and they are 1/2 a mile apart. 2 plex will keep some horrible movie going to prevent the 3 plex from getting the summer action blockbuster.\n\nSo when Solo was tracking bad and the single screen wants to dump it, or put Deadpool 2 back on for the midnight show, Disney can tell them no. Now they can always tell Disney to fuck off, and some theaters do indeed do that. \n\nThe other burn to small theaters recently was that they were effectively forced to lease super expensive digital projectors because film prints don\u2019t really exist anymore, especially major releases. The cost of printing 3500 runs of Solo vs a projector downloading it is has made film prints all but obsolete. Shipping drives is also easier than making prints so that is the alternative for theaters that can\u2019t get a fiber optic line. But traditionally a 90 min film was 4 cans of film that had to be spliced together by a projectionist. Now you have a drive you plug in. It rarely breaks, never melts in the middle of a showing, and you can\u2019t lost 1 of four cans or get stuck because of bad weather. So you used to have a 35mm projector that would work for 20 years just fine.  Now you have a digital projector that, like any other computer, will be obsolete every 5-7 years and so you just continue to lease new projectors endlessly. \n\nSo there you go. \n", "created_utc": 1531885082.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e2l0wbt", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8zo6wh", "parent_id": "t3_8zo6wh", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8zo6wh/ysk_disney_doesnt_play_nice_with_small_town/e2l0wbt/", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "sotruebro", "author_id": "crqoc", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "This is 80% of the reason behind these newer movies record box office numbers. \n\n\nIt\u2019s easy to break records when you don\u2019t allow any competition \n", "created_utc": 1531866884.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e2kiii4", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8zo6wh", "parent_id": "t3_8zo6wh", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8zo6wh/ysk_disney_doesnt_play_nice_with_small_town/e2kiii4/", "score": 44, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "How would Disney know if the theater just quietly put the reels to the side for a couple of weeks and started showing something else?

So open you theater at like 6am, run it 2 times before your normal day even begins. Then pay another employee to stay late and run it one more time as like a midnight showing (which in a small town is probably also a waste) and then maybe run it one time in a real time slot during the day as an early showing. There is 4 times. Sure it cost you a bit of money I guess for a couple weeks, but  I would imagine that even with TLJ the ticket sales for those first 2 weeks would probably have more then covered the extra bit of payroll you used.\n\nI can understand the reasoning on both sides of the deal, each wants to make money.

Can't fault them for that as it was the economically sound choice. It's a stupid business move on Disney's part. They can't treat all theaters as equal. Sooner or later they are going to own so many franchises that they will only be locking themselves out anyways. They are blinded by their own greed.

There are other organizations that have the resources and stature to compete with Disney.  The Bell System certainly was one, and as companies go, it just as pervasive and insidious if not more so.\n\nThe Bell System consisted of over two dozen subsidiaries, or \"associated companies,\" as AT&T liked to call them, in order downplay the fact that they were a monopoly.   Nearly all of these companies were wholly- or majority-owned by AT&T.  First among these was \"Long Lines,\" which was the sole provider of long distance service for every telephone subscriber in the US.  Other entitles, such as Southern Bell, Pacific Bell, and so on, were the sole providers of local phone service to over 75% of the country, their collective territory included most major cities and state capitals.  The two largest independents, GTE (now part of Verizon) and United Telecom (now part of Sprint), served much of the rest of the country.  Some really far-flung rural areas were served by various co-ops and small \"hometown\" operations.\n\nIt did even end there.  Your local phone company, whether Bell or independent, owned your telephone.  Every phone in your home or business was rented.  It was not possible to go to an electronics store and purchase one.  You had to call the phone company and arrange for an installer to come to your house and hard-wire the thing onto your wall.  It was also illegal to modify or tamper with your phone in any way.  That phone, I might add, was probably made by AT&T's manufacturing arm, Western Electric.  Even if it wasn't, it was almost certainly designed by their R&D arm, Bell Laboratories, which also invented a whole bunch of other stuff.  Seriously, do a google search for \"list of Bell Labs inventions.\"\n\nThe reason I mention this is that anti-trust actions don't happen overnight; the government can't compel the break-up of an alleged monopoly by fiat.  Someone (usually the US Justice Department) has to file a lawsuit, and win.  Anti-trust trials tend to be drawn-out, acrimonious affairs, and very expensive to boot. The DoJ filed its suit in late 1974, and the final settlement wasn't reached until mid-1982.  It would be another 20 or so months until the breakup officially came into force.\n\nThe government broke up AT&T because they felt it was in the public's interest.  The implicit acceptance of AT&T's monopoly position starting in the early 1920s was a product of its time.  The arrangement brought harmonization and standardization to what was then an unwieldy patchwork of sometimes incompatible systems that did not fully interconnect.  The furtherance of technology and changing public desires made this long-time arrangement obsolete.  AT&T had long promised to provide lifeline service at a reasonable cost, and in return, the government turned a blind eye to anti-competitive practices.  When AT&T starting providing crappy service and overcharging its customers, they promised to improve.  After years of broken promises, something had to be done.\n\nMickey Mouse is not a lifeline.", "created_utc": 1531897563.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e2l9ok5", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8zo6wh", "parent_id": "t1_e2kszwf", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8zo6wh/ysk_disney_doesnt_play_nice_with_small_town/e2l9ok5/", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "fnord_bronco", "author_id": "ifpit", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I mean saying they're negatively affecting the industry because of an article about a pretty specific problem (small theatres) is a bit dramatic.
