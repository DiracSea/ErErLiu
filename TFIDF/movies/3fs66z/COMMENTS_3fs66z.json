CGI wasn't used for everything in the prequels. Sure most of Coruscant and some other things were done in CGI, but there are far more practical effects in the prequels than people realize. There were tons of set pieces, models, and other physical things created for the prequels. The CG that people tend to dislike from the prequels tends to be Jar Jar Binks and some of the other alien races that were simply blended into the movies terribly. \n\nIf you care to, go back and look through the behind the scenes stuff for Phantom Menace and Revenge of the Sith. Saying the prequels was a shitty cgi fest is insulting to the artists that made both practical and fantastic cgi in the prequels. \n\nAlso, wooden acting has more to do with being directed than it does what surrounds you. The overarching plot aside, the dialogue is terrible in the prequel movies. In addition, plenty of the actors from the prequels have been in other movies that have just as much CGI, but the acting is much better. The difference is George Lucas is a mediocre director, but has a fantastic world crafting mind. A good comparison is look at how wooden Mark Hamill's acting is in A New Hope compared to Empire Strikes Back. The difference is so astounding it seems as though Hamill became a completely different person.\n\nIn all honesty, the overarching plot of the prequels sit on pretty solid ground. After all, they should feel different from the OT. The original trilogy is about a group of rebels holding on desperately against an overpowering Empire, while the prequels are meant to show the fall of the Republic and Jedi and the rise of Darth Vader and the Empire. It shouldn't be shocking that politics becomes a forefront issue in the prequels while it was a backdrop to the OT. \n\nI hope Disney revisits the prequel films and either spends the time to recast/shoot them and integrate the story better, or at the very least attempt to fix them by either re-cutting the films or filming new scenes that can be added to the old scenes. A good starting point would be to have never killed Darth Maul in the movieverse. This would disrupt plotlines in the Clone Wars animated series, but having Maul still be cut in half, but Palpatine salvaging what's left of his body and turning it into part cyborg would be excellent foreshadowing to what would eventually lead to the destruction of Anakin Skywalker and the rise of Darth Vader.\n\nOf course the next obvious point would be to eliminate the Jar Jar Binks character/rewrite and design the character to be far better. After all, Jar Jar Binks ends up playing a pretty important part to granting Palpatine the last step in giving him total control over the Republic. There are a myriad of other changes that could be made that have a chance of making the prequels into fantastic films. The issue of course is why would Disney ever spend the money to do so? There's no point as the audience they'd re-release those movies for is so soured on the prequels they likely would never give them a chance.", "created_utc": 1438726026.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "ctrmdtu", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_3fs66z", "parent_id": "t1_ctrjn1x", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/3fs66z/we_think_cgi_sucks_because_we_only_notice_bad_cgi/ctrmdtu/", "score": 21, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I realize this is probably an unpopular opinion, but the prequels actually used a lot of practical effects.

Now, I'm not an expert so I might have this completely wrong, but as far as I can tell BRDF refers to algorithms that simulate light being reflected off of 100% opaque surfaces, which is unsuited for slightly translucent flesh, and BSSRDF refers to algorithms that try to emulate the effects of subsurface scattering as well as reflectance.
