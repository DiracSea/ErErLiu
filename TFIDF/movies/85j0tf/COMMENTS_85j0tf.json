Certainly I didn't find the production stressful compared to other movies.\n\nLast minute story rewrites and character changes is standard operating procedure at Disney and happens on *every* movie.  If anything, I'd say Moana had less of that than other recent movies. Zootopia and Frozen in particular had very drastic story changes very late in development. \n\nTamatoa was part of early drafts as I recall. It was just one of the last sections to be fully animated so there was more scope to make last-minute changes. And if there's a chance to make last minute changes Disney always does so! HeiHei the chicken wasn't added late in the development either but was there from the start. They changed the character - sure - but it wasn't a last minute addition.  Again, changing character traits late in development is very normal based on test screening feedback. One of the reasons Disney stories are so strong is they aren't afraid to make changes. Nothing is untouchable. Nor should it be.\n", "created_utc": 1521499592.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dvyrj7z", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_85j0tf", "parent_id": "t1_dvyfibr", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/85j0tf/john_musker_the_codirector_of_the_little_mermaid/dvyrj7z/", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "sectionV", "author_id": "d5mwt", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": ">I hate that they don't 2d art anymore.\n\nSo do a lot of the Disney animators.", "created_utc": 1521481111.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dvy86mu", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_85j0tf", "parent_id": "t1_dvy5sz0", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/85j0tf/john_musker_the_codirector_of_the_little_mermaid/dvy86mu/", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Can a brotha get a link ", "created_utc": 1521474402.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dvy0vsc", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_85j0tf", "parent_id": "t1_dvxxd5q", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/85j0tf/john_musker_the_codirector_of_the_little_mermaid/dvy0vsc/", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "IIIIIIIIIIIIlllll", "author_id": "15d4rp", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "[You're Welcome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cpcv-g9TEPI)", "created_utc": 1521472010.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dvxyetc", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_85j0tf", "parent_id": "t1_dvxyapw", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/85j0tf/john_musker_the_codirector_of_the_little_mermaid/dvxyetc/", "score": 6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Malthus0", "author_id": "77wu4", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock.
