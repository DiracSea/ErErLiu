movies just cost a lot more, because typically they use the medium to convey a story. It sounds condescending but it's no way condescending, since Jackie's films were always about conveying the beauty of martial arts first, story second.  I hate the crassness of the analogy but on some level it works: Jackie Chan films are like pornography in that you know what you're watching the film for, and the parts in between the action are mostly filler of run of the mill story. \n\nHell, even the Rush Hour movies and Shanghai films tried to have some story that worked.  The \"rule\" is that action should only be necessary to move the plot along. I love Jackie's films, but many of the fights are contrived and move the story a minimal amount -- as in, they only present a minor obstacle for our hero, but it takes 8-10 minutes of film time for the obstacle to be overcome. But they're a damn entertaining 8-10 minutes. \n\nRush Hour was part martial arts and part comedy and part story. With all the different location shoots, along with the insane salary demands of Jackie and Tucker after the first one, you can't really blame anyone for the fight scenes looking different from 80s/90s Jackie films. American films have unionized crews and tight schedules so that films can be wrapped up on time, because time = money and overtime = 1.5 x money, and that's for an entire crew. \n\nWith many of Jackie's own films taking place in China, it wouldn't be surprising if they lacked unions and got paid peanuts compared to American crews. \n\nFinally, there's the issue of Jackie's fight crew, which appears in many of his own films to the point that literally American actors whose only useful acting skill was martial arts were replaced because they wouldn't be accustomed to Jackie's methods -- it's a lot like music or dancing, there's a rhythm to it and some members fit, some don't. Take Journey for example, their \"new\" singer is a dead ringer for Perry's voice, but he just lacks that certain something, along with the fact that the band openly and softly said that he'd phrase and time the words just a little too differently from the material. \n\nThe Karate Kid film allowed Jackie more freedom with the fighting, due to it being partly financed by china, but considering that he was literally the only real recognizable actor with a resume of at least 3-4 films, the production costs -- even with at least some cheaper American crews -- cost $40-50 million, which is just outrageous when you consider that most of the filming was done in the same area, and even if Jackie took an outrageous $10 million salary (probably closer to $6-8 million at most, considering it was his last American film that anyone recalls), where did the other $35 million go?  It wasn't for on screen talent (as Taraj Henderson had a small roll), and not only did the Asian actors likely cost half as much as they do here, there was only one adult Chinese actor -- most of the actors were kids. There were some beautiful scenery shots, but even allocating *$1 million* to get a total of 3 minutes of scenic shots is crazy expensive. So having Jackie do even 50% of Jackie already costs literally $20 million dollars more, and probably $25 million total, at least -- and no American studio is going to sign off on $20 million being allocated to fighting.  \n\nThere's a reason it has been 6 years and no sequel for a while even though the film made NINE times its budget -- I can't recall an established film franchise making 9x its budget and not having a sequel -- but I would guess that it would cost close to $100 million due to Jaden's parents' negotiating his new salary, Jackie and his team negotiating a higher salary, and getting Henderson back -- we are looking at $40 million in salary alone, add in another $40 million for fighting and $20 million for everything else and the film becomes a risk of flopping, since the first one was a hit, but largely due to budget as $360 million isn't worth a $100 million risk, and Jaden is likely too toxic to pull in over $150 million these days. Even if they started production next year and released in late 2018, it will have been 8 years between films.\n\n**TLDR -- Jackie is a perfectionist, so are many other people. It's just that Jackie's methods don't lend themselves well to American films because no studios will want to pay an extra $20-40 million on top of their fight budget. Doing a scene 500 times with an American crew would cost soooo much money for one scene -- we're talking one week of shooting after weeks of preparing for a 2 minute scene. There's a reason, on top of the Jaden factor, why there is no sequel for the Karate Kid yet, arguably the most \"Jackie film\" of his American films -- and that was half financed by china.**", "created_utc": 1479067891.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d9ythls", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_5cpw2z", "parent_id": "t1_d9yhnwd", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/5cpw2z/after_56_years_and_200_films_jackie_chan_has/d9ythls/", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Death_Star_", "author_id": "box44", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Ha, perfectionist is code for difficult person to work with.", "created_utc": 1479064184.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d9yqkom", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_5cpw2z", "parent_id": "t1_d9yhnwd", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/5cpw2z/after_56_years_and_200_films_jackie_chan_has/d9yqkom/", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Hollywood does that to mask shitty choreography.\n\nLook at this stupid shit http://i.imgur.com/JZhfCyp.gif", "created_utc": 1479060250.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d9ynhh7", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_5cpw2z", "parent_id": "t1_d9yn190", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/5cpw2z/after_56_years_and_200_films_jackie_chan_has/d9ynhh7/", "score": 189, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Dav136", "author_id": "hihns", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Every Frame a Painting is dope.

Western philosophical treatment of eastern philosophy was a joke at least in this one class I took. The teacher didn't understand that the opposing philosophers exaggerated certain aspects of their opponent's philosophy to the point that they were obviously absurd and could not be attributed to the original philosopher.\n\nE.g. Mencius said that Yang Chu would not pluck out a single hair even if it were to benefit the entire world. It was taught in this class, among many others in University readers that I searched that this was what Yang Chu believed. This comes from a false attribution, and leaves off critical portions of the original quote, such as what particular action Mencius and others assume would benefit all and the fact that Yang Chu rejects the premise as impossible in response.\n\nAll these philosophers point to some sort of hidden subjective reality that performing certain actions in a certain way will lead to certain consequences, pretty much just karma, but only appear to disagree on what and how.\n\nObjectivity cannot fully explain how being a filial child or performing traditional rites will make everyone happier and more naturally compassionate, but every philosopher from Confucious onward has some form of what is essentially an opinion on which subjective, conceptual actions lead to which subjective, conceptual results and which are ideal. If you notice the nuances of Confucius answers' (different for each student in many situations), and that they are largely guided by principles, like \"don't do to others what you would not want done to you\" you see that they don't necessarily disagree, but are potentially all saying the same thing in different ways that would benefit contemporary peoples' biases, including the strawmen forms of each other's philosophy that they set up to knock down even when it's not a complete or accurate representation.\n\nMy teacher was unthinking and accepted whatever the popular western interpretation was, which was an overly literal interpretation, and got simple facts wrong as a result, but that's academia for you.

The most well known of these schools are those that were based in Hong Kong during the 1950s and 60s, as many of the attending students subsequently embarked on successful careers in the Hong Kong film industry.\n\nIn learning Peking opera, attending students developed skills in martial arts, acrobatics and tumbling, music and dance and performed these skills for audiences. The schools produced a generation of stunt performers, action choreographers, actors and film directors including some of the most famous stars of Hong Kong action cinema. Public interest in Peking Opera waned in the late 1960s[1] and during the Cultural Revolution most of the schools were closed.\n\nHistorically, pupils had been handpicked at a young age by a teacher (or sifu) and trained for a period of seven to ten years, on contract from their parents. As the teacher provided food and accommodation for the pupils during this period, they accrued a debt to the teacher that was later repaid through performance earnings. After 1911, training took place in more formally organised schools. Typically, students at these schools rose at five o'clock in the morning for exercises. The daytime would be spent learning the skills of acting and combat, and the senior students would perform in outside theatres in the evenings. If they made any mistakes during such performances, it was not uncommon for the entire group to be beaten with bamboo canes. Schools with less harsh training methods began to appear in 1930, but all schools were closed down in 1931 after the Japanese invasion. The modern schools, such as the China Drama Academy and the Spring and Autumn Drama School opened after the war, in around 1952.[2]\n\nFrom Wiki", "created_utc": 1479071052.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d9yw1sy", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_5cpw2z", "parent_id": "t1_d9yurai", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/5cpw2z/after_56_years_and_200_films_jackie_chan_has/d9yw1sy/", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "SleepNowMyThrowaway", "author_id": "kfugu", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "\"I Am Jackie Chan\" \n\nAmazon https://www.amazon.co.uk/I-am-Jackie-Chan/dp/0330375903\n\nAudible http://www.audible.co.uk/pd/Biographies-Memoirs/I-Am-Jackie-Chan-Audiobook/B004EXFASQ?source_code=M2M14DFT1BkSH082015011W\n\nDisclaimer: I'm in no way affiliated with anything here, I just love Jackie Chan and his autobiography is one of my favourite books.
