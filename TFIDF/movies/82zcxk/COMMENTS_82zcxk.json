Of course we want to improve on that and one thing I'm working on is our alumni relations so they will donate to the chapter and SeriousFun. Being able to donate $10,000 one of these years would really be great and a personal point of pride knowing where my chapter came from. Slow and steady, one day we'll get there.\n\nAnyone interested in donated please google SeriousFun and check it out, every dollar helps!", "created_utc": 1520541338.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dve7rk6", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_82zcxk", "parent_id": "t1_dve6og7", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/82zcxk/susan_sarandon_has_revealed_that_paul_newman_once/dve7rk6/", "score": 6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Novice89", "author_id": "6op0a", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Ayy Zeta Lambda represent", "created_utc": 1520546098.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dvecz9d", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_82zcxk", "parent_id": "t1_dveb6w5", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/82zcxk/susan_sarandon_has_revealed_that_paul_newman_once/dvecz9d/", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Jacob19603", "author_id": "5zn1i", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Heyyy!

I really do. You see, I have been in a very unfulfilling relationship for 2 years. I started out happy, but gradually, I lost that loving feeling. The trouble was that his deeply passionate affection for me had not abated in the least; if anything, Brian had fallen so much in love that he would cry every time he said, \"I love you,\" which was a few dozen times per day. This may have contributed to my growing apathy. I am a caring person and I DO love him (like a brother); I certainly didn't want to break his heart. This is why I have remained in the relationship for so long. I have wracked my brains trying to come up with a way to make him want to leave me. His mother had me over for Thanksgiving dinner. She had flown her long-lost brother over from Poland and had spent days preparing a sumptuous feast. Right after Grace was said, I climbed up on the table, pulled down my panties, and took a massive dump on the sage-infused turkey and stuffing. His family has shunned me; he not only stayed with me, he also shunned THEM in return. Even after I doused all his clothes in gasoline and put them, his state-of-the-art home media system, and the teddy bear his deceased grandmother had given him as a boy in his beautifully-restored Shelby Cobra 427 SC and threw in a burning book of matches, he didn't even get mad! He smiled, pulled me close, and said that I was the only thing he couldn't bear to lose. Well, heck, after tat, what was I going to do? So cut to last night. We had just sat down to watch \"King of the Hill\" (the one where Boomhauer gets his heart broken by that dang ol' rich girl-I love that one), and it was going to be a casual dinner night-Tostitos and dip. I had seen this salsa queso dip at publix and thought it would be tasty. I handed Brian the jar and tore open the chips bag. He unscrewed the lid. An unearthly stench immediately assaulted our nostrils. I spontaneously blew grits into the brand new bag of chips. My vomit and the substance in the jar were indiscernible. Same look, same odor. Brian flew into a rage. \"WHAT THE H E DOUBLE HOCKEY STICKS ARE YOU TRYING TO DO-KILL US BOTH????\" I shook my head in confusion, unable to answer. He strode into my bedroom, grabbed the few belongings of his that were I my place, and shouted, \"DONT EVER LET ME SEE YOUR WICKED FACE AGAIN!\" That's it. He's gone.
