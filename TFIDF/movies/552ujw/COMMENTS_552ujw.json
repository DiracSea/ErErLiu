Tokyo Story requires no special film knowledge or even film appreciation. All it takes is the patience to sit down in front of a screen for 2.5 hours with no explosions or car chases.\n\n(Well, actually, there is one other thing that can be difficult: Ozu is one of the few directors to use a \"film language\" that is fundamentally different than the standard Hollywood style. In particular, Hollywood movies tend to film conversations as if we are looking over the characters' shoulders; like we are sitting beside the ongoing conversation. Ozu puts us right in the middle of a conversation and has the actors talk directly to the camera. This difference can be a little disorienting and unsettling at first, but, in my experience, it really doesn't take that long before it feels natural.)", "created_utc": 1475190078.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d87khi4", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_552ujw", "parent_id": "t1_d878n88", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/552ujw/martin_scorseses_list_of_39_essential_foreign/d87khi4/", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "DavidPastrnak", "author_id": "rava5", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "> amazing shots\n\nlike anytime Setsuko Hara is on screen?\n\n> without...anything spectacular\n\nif the shots of her don't qualify as spectacular I don't know what that word means.
