I've seen the Room at least 20 times and thought the Disaster Artist was the funniest book I've ever read. I'm super hyped for this movie especially since it's gotten stellar reviews so far. Otherwise I'd be worried (Franco's impression seems good, but he's way too tall and skinny -- Wiseau is pretty short and stocky). Casting wise; Seth Rogen is PERFECT for his role. So is Sharon Stone. Dave Franco is where I begin seriously questioning things. And it's not just his height (Greg Sestero is literally a tall model who towers over Wiseau) and Dave Franco is short. Plus, everything I've seen from his mannerisms directly contradict Greg Sestero's attitude. Take this poster for example: He never *warmly* smiled (he and his family guffawed at an advanced screening they received) at this train wreck (unless it was with the expectation it would never see the light of day). Sestero was well aware of the train wreck that was being created far before filming ever started. He was probably the first to read the non-sensical script and let Wiseau know how crazy it was. Wiseau brushed it off. Sure, Sestero was slightly passive in much of his criticism, but it was definitely there.\n\nFor example, right before the film played at the premiere, one of the actors (coincidentally the guy who originally had Sestero's role was there) turned around in his seat, and reminded Sestero that this movie would permanently be listed on his imdb page.\n\nIt's important to note that in no way the look on Franco's face in this shot is meant as disappointment. it should ONLY be interpreted as \"I have created a legitimate work of art masterpiece.\" \n\nMost importantly, Sestero was Wiseau's roommate* (this is a funny, somewhat horrifying story) and friend* (also somewhat complicated), but definitely wasn't like this saccharine type that appears to be exhibited in Dave Franco's \"kid glove\" treatment in the clips and the look on his face in this shot. If anything, he viewed Wiseau with skepticism and severe reservations. At the point this film premiered, Sestero was happy enough for Wiseau, but certainly wouldn't have been smiling like this. If anything, Sestero was one of the few people that managed to \"handle\" Wiseau without being fired or quitting (basically because Wiseau bribed and lied to keep him along).\n\nI'm nitpicking, but I freaking loved this book.

It was the premiere, nearly the entire cast was there plus Wiseau and Sistero. \n\nThe film is incredible. It is a faithful adaptation of the book that Greg wrote, and it is just as absurd and incredible as you'd hoped it would be. \n\n\nThis movie does NOT make fun of Tommy or The Room. It is incredibly heartfelt, wonderfully constructed, and hilarious in all the right ways all the way through it. \n\nThe scenes they did recreate are nearly perfect (there was about 10 minutes at the end of the movie where they showed scenes they reshot side by side with the actual movie, and holy shit Franco got every. Last. Detail.), and the performances are respectful and faithful to their source material / actors. \n\nI was slightly worried that Franco couldn't pull the likeness off, but after five minutes or so it was spot on. There were scenes where he looked and sounded exactly like Wiseau, it was great. \n\nThe crowd loved it, there was a Q&A after with tommy hosting, and in line before the film let in they gave out some awesome branded mini foot balls and plastic spoons. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/5p7ofYy.jpg\n\n\n\nThis movie lives up to every bit of hype that I had for it and then some. It's also really fucking good, too. \n\nThe absurdity that went into creating the room is wonderfully captured, I can't even begin to tell you how well all the secondary parts were played. \n\nGo see this. It may actually have a shot at some major awards this year, it's great.\n\n\nOh. And there IS a post credits scene that is not to be missed.
