People didn't go out to see movies like Magnolia, Nightcrawler, or Moon (just citing some favorites around here from the more Indie market.) - People went out to see movies like Avengers, The Dark Knight, and Star Wars.\n\nAnd there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. People are so goddamned eager to crucify someone for killing cinema. It's such a joke, too - yeah, not having real projectors is just _killing_ Cinema. Having to load up gigantic reels that are more expensive in every which way is an expense every cinema should take on. That's why those small arthouse cinemas which pay extra for these things are doing so well, right?\n\nThe thing that's killing cinema is the reality that the cinema isn't relevant anymore. And that's coming from a film student who's been more or less active on /r/movies for eight years. I've been watching movies my entire life - and the cinema experience is just outdated. Don't get me wrong, it's a nice luxury, but come on. If I wanted to, I could be speeding down the highway at 80 Miles Per Hour, and have Guardians of the Galaxy playing in the palm of my hand - hook it up to my speakers, and I'll have better sound quality than the theater. \n\nWhat gets me is that people just can't accept that fact. There is something magical about the memories of the theater - but come on. How often do you _really_ go? If you're an avid movie-watcher, I'm guessing you have a Netflix subscription - and it doesn't go unused. I can find time to go to the movies once a week if I want - by comparison, I can watch seven Netflix movies a week without even really denting my schedule.\n\nAnd that's for an avid moviegoer. For an average person, going to the movies is a once a month - if that - experience. It's expensive. (Hell, it's _always_ been relatively expensive in terms of gas, snacks, and time.) It's not private - there's etiquette that has to be observed, and you're always taking a gamble on the crowd ruining the movie. And that was fine, because it was the only option. Ticket sales began to drop as soon as home video was invented - and now, we've hit the real point of obsolescence. In just about every way except for that classic 'going to the movies' experience, the home viewing experience is just better.\n\nSo, you tell me. Introspective Indie Movie, Big Franchise Blockbuster. I can go see one in a big crowded theater for an experience where I don't necessarily need to pay attention to the whole movie as much as enjoy myself - and I can see the other at home, where I can soak up the plot and themes without having to stand up for that dude to go get his second tub of popcorn.\n\nCan you _really_ blame anyone? The Film Studios are just releasing the movies that audiences want. Yeah, we all liked those semi-Indies that had a great plot, great story, great characters, but they still underperformed the blockbusters by at least a factor of ten times - if not less. The Audiences just aren't responding. The Theatres can't meet audience demands because there's no way they can compete with on-demand - and they're working on a business model that's thirty years old. They're in a dead-end spiral where everyone is constantly looking for cheaper prices, but a better experience; and attempts to modernize lead to people crying heresy, and Quentin Tarantino making lame-ass videos whining about how film is dying.", "created_utc": 1495429952.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1495430371.0, "id": "dhvizsg", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6cjpz1", "parent_id": "t3_6cjpz1", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6cjpz1/netflix_got_booed_at_cannes_but_its_not/dhvizsg/", "score": 9, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Mishmoo", "author_id": "exwp7", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "netflix for $20 a month? did you mean $10?", "created_utc": 1495418839.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dhvbw1s", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6cjpz1", "parent_id": "t3_6cjpz1", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6cjpz1/netflix_got_booed_at_cannes_but_its_not/dhvbw1s/", "score": 17, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "jarek99", "author_id": "1684ee", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "\"They are the perfect representation of American cultural imperialism\"\n\nWhat an idiotic statement.

This was great for Blockbuster, as they made the up-front cost of the video back after a few dozen rentals or so, then it was mostly profit from then on. Most customers weren't going to pay that much for a video up front, so off to Blockbuster people went. After a couple months on the rental market, the price for a copy dropped to $15-$20, and then people would buy a copy for themselves. Everybody was more-or-less happy with this arrangement - Blockbuster made their cash, people got to rent and/or buy movies, and the studios got to sell their stuff twice (once to Blockbuster and again to the consumer).\n\nSomewhere in the mid-ninety's this all went to shit. I remember reading somewhere (but can't find the source now) that Blockbuster wanted to pull in even more cash, so they tried strong-arming studios into cutting them a better deal on movies. Studios balked, told Blockbuster to go fuck themselves, and priced movies at $15-$20 upon release, thereby screwing up the whole rent-then-buy model.\n\nAround this time, lots of folks were getting fed up with ridiculous Blockbuster fees, crappy customer service, and Blockbuster trying to turn themselves into a convenience store.\n\nIf Blockbuster had sense, they would have had the foresight to see where the distribution was shifting and put themselves in the middle of it. But no, they clung on to their antiquated model for far too long. By the time they tried to change things (Blockbuster-on-demand, eliminating late fees, etc) Netflix and others had already taken up Blockbusters' slack.\n\nSo while the 'digital age' may have helped to put Blockbuster under, they really have no one to blame but themselves.", "created_utc": 1495418081.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dhvbd0f", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6cjpz1", "parent_id": "t1_dhva2yw", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6cjpz1/netflix_got_booed_at_cannes_but_its_not/dhvbd0f/", "score": 256, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "psbales", "author_id": "6iwzy", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "The free in store rental got limited to a couple a month though eventually. :(\n\nAlso, they used to put your next videos in the mail right away when you did that, then they changed it to waiting until you returned your store rentals, which sort of defeated the purpose.", "created_utc": 1495416669.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dhvadht", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6cjpz1", "parent_id": "t1_dhva2yw", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6cjpz1/netflix_got_booed_at_cannes_but_its_not/dhvadht/", "score": 36, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "alphasquid", "author_id": "b2fiy", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Blockbuster execs probably curled up into the fetal position when Netflix announced they were going to stream content.
