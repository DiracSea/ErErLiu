If it's just about ticking boxes and absolutely nothing else, why bother including a mediocre movie for a box that's already checked? \n\nAnyone who has been paying attention to the most recent criticism of the Academy knows what's really going on here, it's about trying to appeal to a greater audience.\n\nOver the past 10 years or so, the BP category has become a way of advertising the un-marketable, under-performing \"pet-projects\" of established producers and directors. They all know you can't sell some films with a trailer...films like The Artist, Moonlight or Birdman...hell, probably 75% of the BP nominees since 2010. They just don't have a \"hook\" that will grab attention and interest over the span of 3 minutes. The only way to sell those movies is to turn them into \"critical darlings\", to make sure that the association people have with any of these films is \"People who love movies love this movie\". \n\nThe result of that approach to film awards has been that nobody recognizes the vast majority of the films nominated for ANY major award, not just in the Academy awards either...it's the same with the Globes and SAG. \n\nPlenty of people have been noticing this trend and pointing it out, but Hollywood has since been all-too-happy to ignore those complaints so long as the end-result was that more people watched the nominated movies.\n\nThe problem is that, as the unknown-and-unmarketed film became the rule instead of the exception, people stopped giving a shit about The Oscars and didn't bother to watch the show. It didn't help that the show just started becoming...bad. Bad jokes, bad music, and people who are apparently professional actors looking like cardboard puppets when tasked with presenting an award...it's not fun. \n\nThe whole thing has the feel of a half-baked commercial.\n\nI don't imagine that'll change this year. Hell, my prediction is that this is going to be the biggest shit-show of the lot. It's telling that nobody seems to want to host them, that used to be the big honor.
