Using secrecy, hidden traps, blades, maybe a few raiding parties or a traitor as an assassin.

They relied on a doctor's programming and loyalty to be literally unbreakable. Untrue. They relied on the emperor being aloof and remaining distant in the constant petty feuds between noble houses. Untrue. They relied on the harkonens being too broke and incompetent after losing the most important planet in the universe to be able to launch a full scale invasion. Because of the Emperors participation this was untrue. They relied on no one being reckless enough to use artillery against a shielded position. Very untrue. \n\n\nThe Harkonens broke just about every social convention of the endemic warfare in this very rigid society. No one raised in this society, so focused on custom and convention, could possibly have prepared for these circumstances. And even if they could have, there was *nothing* they could have done to defend against so many sardukar. Not in the time they had anyway.
