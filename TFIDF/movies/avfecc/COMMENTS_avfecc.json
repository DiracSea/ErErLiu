Daniel is incensed because this undermines his view of the Doubtfire scheme as a noble or necessary endeavour instead of just something he's doing for himself, to get to see them. He's still not ready to accept that though, so lashes out with the lime-throw in response instead. The move is inherently funny, but we also feel bad for Stu because he didn't deserve it at all, which also adds to the comedy by making the assault that much more childish and audacious.\n\nThis is all part of the way the movie builds to the pepper scene in the climax, where Daniel finally, completely realizes that he's become the villain in their lives, and gives up *everything* on the spot - his career, his dual identity, his chances of getting back with Miranda - to save Stu. He and Stu awkwardly have a man-to-man handshake afterwards, and Stu and Miranda ultimately end up together(this would be counterproductive to our enjoyment if the movie wanted us to see him as the enemy of justice, again confirming it does not). \n\nDaniel's overall redemption doesn't come until the epilogue, where he turns his talents to something productive, even while thinking he'll never spend normal time with his kids again(ie. the Doubtfire show has already taken off long before he regains partial custody).

Nice restaurant, pretty formal. At one of the tables next to us was what I assumed was a family having a nice dinner: mom, dad, 3 kids and grandma. Nothing out of the ordinary, although the grandma kept getting up and leaving the table and coming back. Which I only noticed because she sort of had to squeeze past my chair each time. Anyway I didn't think much of it - she looked pretty old, figured she just had to use the restroom frequently or something.\n\nAnyway, toward the end of the meal, the dad starts choking on his food. Like hardcore, turning red, can't breath at all choking. Everyone kind of freezes in panic, but the grandma runs over behind him, literally picks him up out of his chair and does the heimlich. I mean she was a big woman but she had to be at least in her 70's - gray hair, old lady glasses, granny dress. But I guess she still had some farm girl strength or something.\n\nSo she has this full grown man up in the air, but then she stumbles under his weight and falls backward. In the process whatever he was choking on gets dislodged and literally flies up into the air from the force of the fall.\n\nObviously everyone in the restaurant is watching at this point. It registers with all of us that he's no longer choking, which was a relief, but then it pretty quickly turned to concern - is grandma OK? I mean she just fell backward and had a full grown man land on her. \n\nShe slowly gets to her feet... and she's clearly wearing a mask, which has partially peeled off from all the commotion. She doesn't realize right away but the rest of the family obviously does. So I look closer and IT'S A MAN! The mom obviously recognizes the guy - sort of stammers/yells his name, and immediately starts gathering the kids to get the hell out of there. \"Grandma\" just peels away the rest of the mask and stands there looking like he's going to cry and eventually just walks out.\n\nI have never been able to figure out what the F was going on. I mean \"Grandma\" was out to eat with the family like she was someone they knew. But then they clearly knew the guy when the mask came off.
