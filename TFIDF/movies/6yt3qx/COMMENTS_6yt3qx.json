Sorceror's Stone and Chamber of Secrets were undeniably centered towards a younger audience, keeping the glee and campiness center stage. There's nothing inherently wrong with this, in fact it could be seen as good\u2026 if not for the later movies in the series.\n\nPrisoner of Azkaban is, aesthetically, a good film. Alfonso Cuaron is a mastermind and I have nothing but respect for his work. That being said, this movie just didn't do much for me. The plot was weighted too much in Harry's *feels* about a character we had never heard of before in the series, as if he was conjured solely to increase the length of the series. The entire story seemed like filler, and the only memorable moment is the twist with (spoilers) Peter Pettigrew, and how Sirius was actually a friend all along. But this still restates my previous point; none of it matters past this movie, except maybe to give Harry someone else to monologue with.\n\nHowever, for all its flaws that I can see, it does put the series on the right direction - to a grittier, more adult aesthetic. Cuaron changed how we see Harry Potter, and David Yates (who directed the later films) absolutely ran with the material. Once \"Goblet of Fire\" released, it was a string of wins after wins after wins. I don't think I've ever seen a series that holds its quality over this many sequels, let alone *improves* upon it.\n\nSo, tl;dr, the films get better as they go along, because they accept that a darker tone is what's best for the films. It takes the worst that can be done by the Wizarding world and gives you hope. It gives you something to root for. It makes the characters *human.*", "created_utc": 1504887116.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dmqhlnj", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6yt3qx", "parent_id": "t1_dmqgtod", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6yt3qx/what_i_love_about_older_dvds_is_the_effort_they/dmqhlnj/", "score": 8, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Calebrox124", "author_id": "7g9eh", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I can dig that. In retrospect, you're right; a lot of Prisoner of Azkaban *was* filler. However, I kind of enjoy that about it. It doesn't feel too involved but it's still in there. A lot of it is Harry at Hogwarts and things just happening as they do without much intervention from Voldemort. I know it's not for everybody, but that's my favorite part about it. It's kind of like a window into how the world would be if Voldy wasn't screwing around everywhere\n\nAs for the first movies being kids movies, I can understand your beef with the contrast, but the way I look at it, and kind of like the movies follow the audience growing up, in a way. if you're 10 years old watching Sorcerers Stone, that movie is a perfect of serious and light-heartedness. And as you grow up, you want more serious stuff, and the movies (somewhat) gradually become more and more grim. Just by looking at color schemes, you can tell the mood of the movie. SS is like a bowl of candy and DH looks like someone threw up a cookies and cream milkshake. \n\nOn the topic of color, that's the main reason PoA is my favorite. It's a lot of blues and blacks with not a lot of green in there like there was in CoS. 2nd place for me is OotP, a lot of illuminated blues in that one and I personally dig that a lot. In fact, the color pallet for GoF is probably the reason I don't like it that much. It just seems so bleak all of a sudden. Like dull grey with a hint of orange that doesn't have enough light on it. \n\nBut back to the story aspect, I really liked HBP since it was very dark and mysterious. Like the calm before the storm. DH1 felt like it had a lack of direction sometimes, but it still has some mega cool bits in there.\n\nBut in summary, the later movies come second the PoA just because they're so goddamn bleak and gray comparatively", "created_utc": 1504890457.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dmqkn0o", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6yt3qx", "parent_id": "t1_dmqhlnj", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6yt3qx/what_i_love_about_older_dvds_is_the_effort_they/dmqkn0o/", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "MrAppleSpiceMan", "author_id": "hu6lm", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Personally I didn't really enjoy the later movies. I like 1-4 because they're exciting and fun still, but 5-8 don't really do much for me. They seem depressing and drained. I get that that's sort of the point with Voldemort returning to power, but the books never lose their sense of fun despite all the dark stuff going on. I guess compared to their book counterparts most movies won't exactly match up, but the movies just feel sort of disjointed. \n\nMaybe it's just the characters for me? In the books Ron is always Ron, he grows up but he still feels the same. In the movies Ron goes from being excited and lively in movies 1-4, but turns quite melancholy  in 5-8. \n\nMy favourite movie is probably 3 or 4, 3 because of the awesome music and atmosphere, or 4 because it just feels exciting and international.", "created_utc": 1504889965.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dmqk72f", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6yt3qx", "parent_id": "t1_dmqhlnj", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6yt3qx/what_i_love_about_older_dvds_is_the_effort_they/dmqk72f/", "score": 9, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Renderdp", "author_id": "8bf31", "subreddit_name": "movies"}]
