I also worked in a movie theater when I was a teenager, and it was a great experience. \n\nCleaning up after other people's shit is not a fun aspect of the job, but it has to be done. And it's not like you ever have time to make it a sterile environment. You run through throwing away the trash and if there's a mess you do your best to clean it up, but it's really at night when the cleaning crew comes through that the restroom and theaters are thoroughly cleaned. \n\nI'm scared for the future of the movie theater experience, because Hollywood is desperate to increase their revenues year over year, and that desperation is coming at the expense of the movie theater business model in many ways. \n\nI ALWAYS buy something from the concession stand, no matter if I'm hungry or thirsty. I always report people who think paying for a ticket entities them to behavior that's disruptive to other patrons. I always not only clean up after myself, but make sure the people who came with me take their trash, or I take it for them. \n\nHaving said all that, I also have some experience with economics and as a business investor, since economics is what I got my undergrad in, and investing is where I made the lion's share of my wealth. \n\nThe movie theater business is a capital intensive business with relatively low margins. That's why everyone is paid so horribly. Even a general manager of a large theater is paid shit compared to other people in other occupations who handle similar responsibilities in terms of personnel and cash turnover. The grunts start at minimum wage and rarely is there an opportunity to earn anything more than a token raise. \n\nYou'll often see theaters go into decline after they're built, because the corporation will tend to defer maintenance costs, because cash flow and return on that capital investment is such an issue. \n\nI know in your mind if theater cleaning could suddenly, miraculously be automated, no theater employees would lose their job, but I'm going to tell you that is simply not the case. \n\nMaybe not on an individual basis, but if theater owners could automate any responsibility that an employee has in a cost effective way, they'd do so, and it would be at the expense of that job existing any more. \n\nThat's still not an excuse to not clean up your trash. You're not actually ensuring anyone a job by leaving your shit behind. You're simply rationalizing shitty behavior because you're too lazy and you feel entitled. Same thing people do when they throw trash out the window of their car, or stick an item from a grocery store they've decided they don't want in the nearest shelf space, rather than returning it where it should go.  \n\nBut if there was some way to ensure all trash was picked up after a screening every single time without having an employee involved, I guarantee you theaters would employ fewer people.

But there are going to be drastic changes to the industry. Not this year, and not next year, but soon. There are going to be bankruptcies and mergers, and a lot fewer theaters opening up. \n\nBTW, one of the things I'd love to see is some kind of return to serials, like these:\n\nhttp://www.filmsite.org/serialfilms.html\n\nI don't really have a special affectation towards serials one way or another, but there's a tremendous need to get people in the movie theaters in a cost effective way. \n\nCreating and distributing serials would be similar to the business model HBO has created, and distribution channels like Netflix, Amazon, are trying to follow in to provide exclusive content. \n\nIt would help bring back storytelling as an emphasis. And if movie theaters were the only place you could see these serials, and they were priced well below a regular movie ticket (say half) with more content coming out on a regular basis for a scheduled period of time, if the content was high quality, with an exclusive to movie theaters only, I think it's one way to help save the movie theater business model, at least on some level. \n\nBut that's what movie theaters are missing as much as anything else. They simply don't have a long enough exclusive on content any more, as content producers feel a pressure to deliver rising quarterly numbers, and a big part of that is moving up distribution models which can increase revenue. At the expense of movie theaters. \n\nIn any case, as far as I'm concerned you're doing God's work. Movie theaters are my cathedral in a number of ways. I'm very appreciative of everyone in the industry who help keep that experience alive, so from the bottom of my heart I thank you.

It's one of the most frightening aspects of being someone with the capability of giving a movie the green light. Your whole job is predicated on producing hits, and you have to be declarative and decisive regarding what an audience wants, but the fact of the matter is you're going to be fired from your job one day because the movies you've okayed don't do well enough, and that's just part of it. \n\nTechnology, Hollywood, and movie audiences themselves have worked hand in hand to create an environment where movie executives are convinced the only way to increase revenues year over year is huge tent pole movies with elaborate special effects which creates a presentation that can't be equaled in a home, much less on a computer or mobile device. And, to an extent, they're right. People will often go see movies these days because they want to see something in particular on \"the big screen\" - the whole Go Big or Go Home campaign.\n\nThey'll also go because they want to either be the ones that tell their peers about the movie, or be in on the conversation when the movie is talked about. \n\nAnd of course, there are the number of social factors involved, too. Then there are random people like me who simply like seeing movies in the movie theater. \n\nThe problem with this reliance on tent pole movies, and the certainty executives have that this is the solution to their business model, is that these movies are absurdly expensive. \n\nAnd because they're absurdly expensive, with people's careers not only at stake, but whole studios betting the farm over and over again, there's a lot of risk mitigation. The biggest one is to get proven stars on board that audiences relate to, whose presence audiences have come to trust will ensure a good movie experience. They hire directors who will attract stars, who have shown they can get a project completed, on time and on budget, and have at least demonstrated some success in delivering butts in the seats. \n\nWhat has happened increasingly as budgets have gone up, is a lack of willingness to take a chance on original content. It's not that the content has to have shown it can deliver a huge audience, say the way Harry Potter or the Lord of the Rings had. But it has to show it has attracted some kind of audience. It has to have been tested in the market in one way, shape, or form, otherwise executives aren't going to take a chance on it. \n\nWhich is why it's not just about remakes and reboots. It's tent pole movies based on comic books, or video games, or children's toys, or the Bible. It takes someone like Christopher Nolan or James Cameron, to be able to get a thumbs up for a tent pole project based on original content. And even directors of their stature face significant challenges in getting that done. \n\nIt's also had the further effect of driving the storytellers to television. There's no room for them in Hollywood. If you want to create interesting original content, television is the only real opportunity to do so. \n\nIf I was given the job of God of entertainment for a day, and everyone had to come and pray at my altar, that's the message I would emphasize. The future of the movie industry and the current distribution model isn't in special effects laden tent pole movies. It's in storytelling. The way it's always been. And if you don't figure out a mechanism to make creating new content, new stories, and new characters in an affordable way, the industry as we know it is going to be radically changed. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing. \n\nIt's not necessarily a bad thing that newspapers have had their business model crushed, but it's certainly had consequences - some positive, some negative.  \n\nAs someone who loves going to the movie theater, and being able to see stories told on the big screen, I'd love for my children to have that experience available to them as well. I'm just not convinced right now it's going to happen, or if it does, it won't be a kind of experience I recognize any more. \n\nBut that's okay. \n\nI think I'm going to go chase these kids off my lawn now. \n\n\n\n ", "created_utc": 1471532407.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d6mnkzc", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_4yaqfu", "parent_id": "t1_d6mm0dl", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/4yaqfu/as_a_person_that_cleans_theaters_one_thing_i/d6mnkzc/", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "36yearsofporn", "author_id": "air3r", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I need a source", "created_utc": 1471524911.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d6minwa", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_4yaqfu", "parent_id": "t1_d6mi4iy", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/4yaqfu/as_a_person_that_cleans_theaters_one_thing_i/d6minwa/", "score": 6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Are you a dad?
