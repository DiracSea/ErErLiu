It would've been thrilling to see the society divide over the two powerful titular characters and what a situation like that would've caused. Could Batman, the efficacy of his methods and his possible popularity among the populace have convinced Superman of his world view being naive and ultimately ineffective, or would Superman's positive influence on people have swayed Batman's conviction in ruthless vigilantism and uncompromising denial and disregard of criminals' rights and value as human beings?\n\nBut no, we got a predictable summer blockbuster with little to no content.", "created_utc": 1476973784.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d90bkua", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_58gow0", "parent_id": "t1_d90avtw", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/58gow0/logan_official_trailer/d90bkua/", "score": 25, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "it's a shame what passes for a ninja these days.
