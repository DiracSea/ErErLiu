It's even more stunning when you read what the animators did any why - standard animation is 24fps (frames per second). To emphasize Miles' inexperience and clumsiness, he was mostly animated at 12fps, while others were at 24fps. In industry terms, Miles was animated on 2s, everyone else was on 1s.  But in the pivotal moment when Miles finally *becomes* Spider-man, they animate him on 1s, it's like the crescendo of a song, or a bass drop - it is *amazing.*\n\nAnd that's not even diving into pure visual style - the use of benday dots and hatching for shadows, the colors, the lighting. The city backdrop is a crowded skyscraper metropolis, but *no* building fades into the background thanks to the chromatic abberation - the red/blue halo some people complain about. It's intentional and takes getting used to, just as anything new takes getting used to. The mix of 3D and 2D is so seamless, you could take a still shot and it will *look* like a comic book panel. There is a lot of 2D animation technique used, like using smears and double-images instead of motion blur.\n\nThe music is on point. They have vocal tracks  that embrace Miles' dual heritage (afro-latino), the instrumental tracks are a wonderful mix of styles from R&B to classic orchestra. The Prowler (one of the villains) has one of the most unique and *terrifying* villain themes you've ever heard. On par with the heart-racing urgency of the opening string screech of Sephiroth's theme song, with the ominous warning of Inception's blare.\n\nCharacters get satisfying arcs, especially Miles and Peter. I wish I could go into this more but I have to return to work. \n\nAlso, check out the youtube video How Into the Spider-verse fixed Miles Morales - it gives you some grounding on where Miles started in the comics, and the changes they made for the film - all great changes that elevate Miles and put him on equal footing with Peter Parker without being his replacement.", "created_utc": 1551283455.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1551283673.0, "id": "eheii3m", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_av82ub", "parent_id": "t1_ehdyict", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/av82ub/spiderman_into_the_spiderverse_to_get_national/eheii3m/", "score": 11, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "TechniChara", "author_id": "g4k8h", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "In addition to what everyone else said, its also is a very unique movie.

In order to give depth of field, instead of just making the background or foreground out of focus, they separated and spread out the different components that make up a finished frame in a comicbook. The outlines and the coloured in parts are overlaid and spread out in this way.\n\nWith regards to the frame rate, some of it is 24fps and some of it is 12fps. The background/environment of the scenes are nearly always 24fps so they're smooth. But the frame rates for the characters changes between 12 and 24fps. This is deliberate, to either make the movements of the characters more destinct and memorable like if you were reading a comic. Or it's to show a difference in two characters. For example, there's a scene where Peter B. Parker is teaching Miles Morales to swing in the woods. Miles is in 12fps to show how rough, awkward and new to being Spider-Man he is, he's clumsy and so his animation looks choppy. Peter on the other hand is in 24fps, this shows how fluent, experienced and smooth he is at being Spider-Man.\n\nTl;Dr: the frame rate will be the same in the digital/home release as it was in the theatrical release.
