Here's what he said per an interview published yesterday:\n\n> You know that I tried to avoid the Macroverse in the first movie because the moment that you go to the other side [of the universe] and change the perspective of the storytelling, it becomes a different kind of movie. It becomes a fantasy movie or some sort of hybrid with a fantasy movie, and I didn\u2019t want to go there on the first one.\n\n> **I want to keep it relatively contained in the second one.** I still believe in the same idea of keeping the perspective of our human characters and not jumping to the other side, because the moment you jump to the other side, you\u2019re revealing things that are actually not cool to reveal if you want to maintain the tension and uncertainty. **So expect a little bit of the other side. There\u2019s more deadlights, that\u2019s for sure.**\n\n(Emphasis added).  \n\nhttps://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/it/282095/it-chapter-two-andy-muschietti-cannot-leave-derry", "created_utc": 1563481274.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "eu5ngvu", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ceuch2", "parent_id": "t1_eu5dh9n", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/ceuch2/it_chapter_two_official_trailer_hd/eu5ngvu/", "score": 26, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "sauce_murica", "author_id": "1svdmx2n", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "That fucking sideeye!", "created_utc": 1563471752.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "eu57uzn", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ceuch2", "parent_id": "t1_eu52j4m", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/ceuch2/it_chapter_two_official_trailer_hd/eu57uzn/", "score": 1358, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "ourlegacy", "author_id": "dygf8", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "https://imgur.com/a/lAGnQEF", "created_utc": 1563476517.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "eu5flkj", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ceuch2", "parent_id": "t1_eu52j4m", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/ceuch2/it_chapter_two_official_trailer_hd/eu5flkj/", "score": 17, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "rcarr13", "author_id": "8n9bcdt", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "[deleted]", "created_utc": 1563478840.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1564075234.0, "id": "eu5jet6", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ceuch2", "parent_id": "t1_eu5f2jc", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/ceuch2/it_chapter_two_official_trailer_hd/eu5jet6/", "score": 286, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Not to forget Valter and Gustaf Skarsg\u00e5rd, two other siblings who are also actors.", "created_utc": 1563479270.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "eu5k4wv", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ceuch2", "parent_id": "t1_eu5f2jc", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/ceuch2/it_chapter_two_official_trailer_hd/eu5k4wv/", "score": 12, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Cahootie", "author_id": "gy8cu", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "They are like scandanavian Baldwins", "created_utc": 1563474975.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "eu5d34w", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ceuch2", "parent_id": "t1_eu56otb", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/ceuch2/it_chapter_two_official_trailer_hd/eu5d34w/", "score": 106, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "WaitTilUSeeMyDuck", "author_id": "3mmh40ts", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "His brother is pretty scary on Big Little Lies.", "created_utc": 1563476382.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "eu5fdng", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ceuch2", "parent_id": "t1_eu56otb", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/ceuch2/it_chapter_two_official_trailer_hd/eu5fdng/", "score": 17, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "WrittenSarcasm", "author_id": "cceow", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Well the whole family is pretty badass", "created_utc": 1563477294.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "eu5guwz", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ceuch2", "parent_id": "t1_eu56otb", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/ceuch2/it_chapter_two_official_trailer_hd/eu5guwz/", "score": 14, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "LordMcze", "author_id": "g69d0", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Oh fuck.", "created_utc": 1563475015.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "eu5d5he", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ceuch2", "parent_id": "t1_eu58m66", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/ceuch2/it_chapter_two_official_trailer_hd/eu5d5he/", "score": 11, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "WaitTilUSeeMyDuck", "author_id": "3mmh40ts", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Yep!
