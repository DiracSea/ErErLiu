Actors rely on the director to tell them what do to since they film so much out of sequence that they need to get \"in the moment\" of the scene. If the director gives bad or no direction, you get even Oscar nominated actors giving shit performances (Star Wars prequels and M Night Shyamalan for example).\n\nSonnenfeld himself showed the mistake in the follow-up, Wild Wild West. Instead of having a straight man and funny guy, he got two comedic actors in Wil Smith and Kevin Kline. Which fucked him because instead of working together in a scene to build laughs, they competed with each other to steal laughs.\n\nI don't mean to say that Smith or Kline did so intentionally or tried to show one another up. But that's just the nature. If you have two characters who are both the \"funny guy\" in a scene, there's no building the comedy. You know, setup punchline setup punchline. Instead, it's my joke your joke my joke your joke. It just doesn't work.\n\nLook at Airplane! from the Zucker Abrams Zucker team. It is hands down an insanely goofy movie. But no more than one character in any given scene at most knows it. Everyone else reacts to the insanity with grim deadpan. And it's *fucking hilarious*.\n\nThen look at Batman Forever. Carry and Jones are literally fighting over every laugh, fighting over every scrap of scenery to chew. And Schumacher didn't do anything about it because he was trying to make the 60s TV Batman, not the grittier 80s/90s Batman.\n\nSo that brings us around to Men in Black. MIB works because the only person \"in on the joke\" is J. He's the audience surrogate whose job is to give smartass observations about the insanity around while everyone else goes on with stoic seriousness. And because this dynamic wasn't there in MIB2 and MIB3, a lot of the magic was gone. Not even counting all the other problems (\"Kids love Frank the talking dog, put him on screen as much as possible!\"), the film was doomed from its start because that dynamic was gone. \n\nK switched to the role of audience surrogate. He's the one who has to ask \"What the hell is that thing?\" and have it explained to him (and thus to the audience). Meanwhile, J is now the inside man and the Basil Exposition. *But they did not switch the straight man/joker roles!* You can't have the guy who knows what's going on making the snarky remarks because then it's no longer the character and the audience laughing at the idiocy, it's not the character laughing at the audience for not understanding what's going on. It's now *insulting* the audience, even if we don't get that's what's happening or that's what's intended.\n\nEven if the sequels had the perfect scripts, they still would have failed compared to the first because of that and that alone. Look at MIB3 - it had a really strong script, especially compared to MIB2. But it still failed because that dynamic was exactly the same as MIB2 - J made the snarky remarks about what Past!K (and therefore the audience) didn't know.\n\nMen in Black is a great comedy and, I believe, the next-to-the-last of a breed (Galaxy Quest was the last). It was a comedy that took its plot seriously and drew the jokes from the characters while grounding the situations in the reality as established in the film. Ghostbusters, Back to the Future, Addams Family, all of them grounded their plots and took them seriously within the rules, drawing the comedy from the characters and their reactions to the situations.

It wasn't from an American perspective, it was from a purely British perspective: the world is ending, London represents the world, we don't need heroes, we need to explore what the social implications are.\n\nHave you ever noticed that every Hollywood movie has the jumps when you expect them, the monsters have as many teeth as you're expecting, and the point of the tragedy is usually to let a hero discover something about themselves, hidden deep within, that they just needed the opportunity to let out? 28 Days later didn't have that - the jump scares were a beat too early, or a beat too late, or the monster just looked too real, or the fear in the actors was too palpable and not contrived... It's one of my favorite all time movies, because it's not Hollywood, same and 5th Element.\n\n----\n\nI have the same kind of theory about the difference between American and British TV. Every. Single. American. Sitcom. is about a little lie that unfurls into a big lie. Fucking all of them. Every single episode would become boring if the person had just said, at the very start, \"I'm sorry I didn't buy you a birthday present this year Monica, I've just been totally run off my feet.

We thought you might like it if you let us take you on a picnic to the park, just the three of us, as your present?\" Instead Chandler sneaks into his boss's office to steal back the present he bought in the hopes of sucking up for the big promotion because he overheard something that Ross was saying to Rachel, but he took it totally out of context, and he ended up having to climb out the window because his boss came in at the wrong moment, and while he was out on the ledge he looked in and saw what looked like Phoebe going down on his secretary, and he couldn't work out why Phoebe was in his office and it wasn't her and he ended up being stuck outside all night until the janitor let him back in and then the shops were all shut and he managed to find the perfect present by stealing it from a passing boy scout who bad-mouthed him, but he tripped a passing horse ran over it, and then he arrived at the restaurant with his clothes all torn and the only way out of his pickle was to fake a heart attack.\n\nAnd British shows are only ever about the social implications. A person makes a gaff, or gets into a bind, and the only thing at stake is how it affects their standing in society.\n\nI'm Aussie, so I see these things from the outside.

You think a terrorist is going to sit still for you?\n\n(Before Hill can respond the blaring roar of the alarm sounds as the drill has begun) \n\nTatum: Watch and learn chief! \n\n(The targets are now holografic. Tatum moves left to the first of two targets. A grey humanoin alien holds out a dish of fire. Tatum kicks the hologram down and pops two shots into it. The dish sets the alien on fire.)\n\nTatum: Welcome to Earth!\n \nHill: Oh my god he didn't do anything!\n\nTatum: He's an alien! We're working for NASA!! I'm going to Mars bitch!! Going to become a space cop!! \n\n(Hill follows after Tatum as the next target arrives. A small running target begins going up a flight of stairs to a door. Tatum takes a shot at it and it ducks.)\n\nHill: He's just running! He is not a target!\n\nTatum: The only good alien is a dead one!  (Shoots the alien before it reaches the door)\n\nHill: Wait stop!! (Hill follows to the last target. The target is a grandmother in 1950's like kitchen. The kitchen set is real and grandma is not a hologram. Played by Betty White.) \n\nGrandmother: Oh hello boys! Would you like some cookies? I just made them. \n\nTatum: Hell yeah! Shoot around is over. (Places gun on table and sits down to eat from tray at table. A bell dings)\n\nGrandmother: Oh another batch is ready!\n\nTatum: Awesome Grandma! Got any milk? \n\nGrandmother: In the fridge dear. \n\n(Hill looks at the grandma and notices that she goes into oven and takes out tray with barehands.) \n\n(Hill takes out gun and shoots Betry White in the head.)\n\n(Tatum drops milk and looks at grandma then Hill, does and double take.) \n\nTatum: What?! Holy shit! Why did you shoot Grandma Cookies!??\n\nYes why did you? (K arrives onto the kitchen set and grabs a cookie and inspects it before eatting it.) \n\n(Hill composes himself amd replies)\nHill: Well sir, I uh saw the first two targets were aliens. But the first alien had a tray of fire and I thought that maybe he burned his dinner and needed a fire extinguisher.\n\n(Tatum is enjoying Hill try to come up with a reason. He goes into fridge and takes out a soda from fridge to watch the shit show)\n\nHill: The next alien midget was running up the stairs. And while I thought that was suspicious, he wasn't hurting anyone and maybe he was like late for class or a meeting and had to run?\n\nHill: And grandma was just about to take that cookie sheet with her bare hands. Why would she do that? No body could do that. No... human. Sir.\n\nTatum: (Whispers but loud enough to be obvious) Or maybe she forgot to put the oven mitts on.\n\n(K wrinkles his browl and takes another cookie and begins walking back to exit) \n\nHill: Sir did I fail? \n\n(K stops in his tracks but without turning snaps his fingers.) \n\n(The grandmother quickly rises back up again with a gapping head wound.) \n\n(Hill and Tatum act shocked at this gastly revival.)\n\nGrandmother: Nice shot dear.

A campaign is the setting/storyline you're running the game through.

If you roll a 1 generally something catastraphocically stupid happens. So like, you were trying to headbutt a lion, rolled a 1 and ended up sticking your head directly into its mouth. If you roll a 20 you're automatically supposed to do something badass. Like, you headbutt the lion, it rears up dizzy on its hindlegs and falls off a cliff.

So Jack Burton rolls 1s and 20s because he's always either a fuckup or a badass.\n\nIn regards to \"the fiction\" campaigns can be long with multiple adventures (play sessions) and players can take the storyline fairly seriously. But Jack Burton showed up late and doesn't really care about the storyline they're trying to experience so he plays on a whim taking whatever action he wants, whether or not appropriate to the characters and setting.

In that situation you could be in, he nails a reply. Charlie Sheen is the epitome of this. \n\nIn UK comedy, the comedian takes the position of you, warts and all, the loser; you identify with the person *failing* up there. Consider Miranda - she falls over, gets caught short, says the wrong thing. Jack Whitehall plays up being weak and finnicky and oddball. \n\nThe Office was an interesting one; it is in the same stance, but without a laugh track I found it uncomfortably awkward to watch, like I needed to run away and hide every minute or so. The characters are so ordinary, and the central few are mostly awful. There I felt like I was identifying with the few acceptable characters and feeling their awkwardness as they witness the slaughter of decency or courtesy.\n\nThe IT Crowd has the same UK bent; none of the characters except Reynholm is a winner, and he is a fairly 2D caricature. The main characters are all misfits and oddballs, often exploring single facets of human personality; Moss's oblivious geekiness, Roy's social anxiety, Jen's overconfidence and yearning to fit in. \n\nFew comedies on either side of the pond seem to transgress this setup; exceptions perhaps are Big Bang Theory (although Leonard tends to be the winner again), Not Going Out (I could never identify with Lee Mack's smugness), probably more that I haven't seen in the US.\n\nI suspect this is a good part of why US shows often have a huge team of writers, while UK shows have one or two. A team of writers can come up with every witty comeback, punchline or takedown, but awful, honest failure is best written alone.\n\nAs an aside, I find it amusing to watch US comedies implicitly accept that there are a lot of class issues in the US which were supposedly got rid of with the British (which often pop up again in dealing with race), while in the UK there are a lot of comedies about class which demonstrate unity. As an example Frasier is a class comedy about a working class father to two affected upper-middle class sons, which largely takes pops at the upper classes while venerating the working class. Yet it also ridicules the lower class in many incidental characters. In Fawlty Towers, by comparison, one bitter middle class snob with a huge chip on his shoulder (Basil) is borne with frustration by every corner of society from immigrants (que?) to wealthy guests. I suspect comedians in the US know there are more class issues than Americans would like to admit, whereas in the UK it is an assumed part of the setup but there is actually less than people perceive.\n\nTLDR: Americans like to watch a winner, the British like to identify with a loser.", "created_utc": 1457105608.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d0nenni", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_48vbql", "parent_id": "t1_d0n7f39", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/48vbql/i_just_realized_that_men_in_black_is_one_of_the/d0nenni/", "score": 9, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "NiceyChappe", "author_id": "b0q7j", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Uhh, Clint Eastwood?
