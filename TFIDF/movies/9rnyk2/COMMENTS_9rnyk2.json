There's no tension in her challenges, because she overcomes all of them just by trying. \n- Kylo can't have a conflicted relationship with the force like Vader did, because Kylo is a cold-blooded mother fucker in TLJ. Once Vader found out Luke was his son, he killed more imperial soldiers than he did Rebels or good guys. Kylo has no such plot twist, and he's killed his master, tried to kill his former master, his dad, and if not for magic non-Jedi space flight he'd have killed his mother as well. \n- All of the OT characters are gone except Chewy, R2, and C3PO. I don't believe any of them can be killed off in a meaningful way that makes the film better. I'm sure that won't stop Abrams from trying though. Technically Leia is still there, but that's pre-recorded so who knows what that means.\n- Hyperdrive is a weapon of mass destruction. Established in TLJ. I don't know how they write any meaningful fleet battles or planet evacuations or anything, when the universe has a known weapon that can mangle giant fleets by traveling at light speed. \n- Luke is dead, so Rey and Kylo are the last of the force users as we know them. Luke can come back blue ghost style, but otherwise there's no next level to this. It's just Rey and Kylo having a showdown, and based on what we've seen Rey pretty much has to kill Kylo - there is no way to believably plot twist that away.\n- I'm not sure what purpose Poe plays in this universe. Obviously he's the fly boy, but he's not the love interest and he's not conflicted by anything. He's Wedge Antilles, except he's getting a ton of screen time. My best guess is that he leads the Resistance as a counterpart to Hux (another useless character wasted), but that is basically an entirely new direction for the character and entirely wasteful. \n- There's no more Jedi. If Rey continues towards a Jedi Temple rebuilding, she has to do it from scratch. \n- The closest thing to a romance in these films was Rey and Finn, which is why Rose came out of nowhere and put that to bed. Finn's only use as a character was to give an emotional connection to Rey (who no longer needs one as she has found her way), and now he's emotionally connected to someone else. They will try and write him as a guy moved by Rose, who decides to finally fight for what he loves. It's gonna be flat. \n- If the Empire didn't end 30 years ago, they will have to figure out a way to write away the New Order more permanently. I'm not sure how you do that. \n\nThe worst thing about all of this: everything points to the need for Lucasfilm to expand beyond a trilogy, create new villains, expand the universe, and take time working the garbage fire we have now into a meaningful ending. Maybe we get two trilogies, and X ends with Kylo building the Knights of Ren into some kind of Sith school, while Rey balances that by rebuilding the temple. Even if they do that though, the fatigue that hits after X is going to be a serious blow to the franchise. \n\nI think X does well in theaters, but is absolutely the most hated Star Wars film.

The main reason for doing that is to shove the burden onto the next film of explaining what Luke has been up to? - why he hasn't returned to help the Republic? - why has he let the new Empire rise? - why is he in hiding anyway? The answers to all these questions is that Old Luke is a sad guy who failed to bring lasting peace to the galaxy, but it falls to TLJ to explain this, so people blame TLJ instead of TFA for ***\"ruining Luke.\"*** Actually TFA ruined Luke by setting up the new Empire, canceling the end of ROTJ, showing the rise of a new Sith, and Luke's reaction to all of this is to hide. TFA could have avoided ruining Luke by showing an entirely new threat blindsiding the galaxy that Luke couldn't have had any way to anticipate or prevent, but then they couldn't have made movies about Stormtroopers^TM and Death Stars^TM and Star Destroyers^TM so...\n\nTLJ just tears off the band aid that JJ Abrams put on the Luke character. ***64 year old Luke was never going to start TLJ*** by saying \"Oh, the Republic's in trouble? Cool, thanks for letting me know, girl who I've never met before. I'm going to go be the main character now, you chill here on Game Of Thrones Set Number 42.\" And then he does a backflip and kicks Snoke into a space well. Maybe him throwing away the lightsaber was more of a harsh wake up call than the fans deserved (and the milk scene DEFINITELY was), but the point was made. If you thought TLJ \"subverted\" your expectations of what Luke was going to do in this trilogy, your expectations were dumb. However, if anyone pulled the wool over your eyes in that regard, it was certainly JJ Abrams not Rian Johnson. JJ Abrams was the guy who turned Luke into a fetch quest and ended the movie with a ridiculously melodramatic helicopter shot implying the fatefulness of Rey & Luke's encounter. Just like many other things JJ Abrams has had a hand in, his best characteristic as a director and storyteller is getting you excited for what you're *about* to see.\n\nThe Force Awakens was \"fun\" if you turned off your brain and just accepted that the ending of ROTJ was canceled and now we get another scrappy rebels vs stormtroopers movie. Unfortunately, you can't make an entire trilogy of stories out of a theme park ride approach to the universe. Eventually you have to deal with character and motivation. TFA only dealt with the OG characters by having Leia comment on how cool Rey is, and then killing off Han as a kick-the-dog moment to establish Kylo's evilness. IMO TLJ gets its share of blame because it also bobbles character and motivation. TFA was a good film from the perspective of setting up Kylo, Rey and Finn.
