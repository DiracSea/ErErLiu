In a plot summary released by the writer, these humans were ignored by the Machines during the war due to some deal, and they moved their consciousness into robot bodies to stay alive. Now they're invading the Matrix to regain biological bodies. Neo and Trinity were prototypes for a new iteration of the Matrix and contained a different machine/human interface, hence Neo's powers in \"The Real.\" Trinity is somehow still alive and she journeys to core to reset the Matrix into the next cycle.!<", "created_utc": 1566337459.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1566338198.0, "id": "exix9lf", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ct5aya", "parent_id": "t1_exis4rq", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/ct5aya/matrix_4_officially_a_go_with_keanu_reeves/exix9lf/", "score": 153, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Folseit", "author_id": "3oi2e", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "> experimenting on the corpses\n\nUh, I hate to make an already disturbing scene worse for you, but I was always pretty sure those people were prisoners taken alive and vivisected, not fresh bodies pulled off the battlefield...", "created_utc": 1566340409.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "exj28lg", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ct5aya", "parent_id": "t1_exizzis", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/ct5aya/matrix_4_officially_a_go_with_keanu_reeves/exj28lg/", "score": 13, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Xyyzx", "author_id": "gzofv", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "\"What's really gonna bake your noodle later on is, would you still have knocked it over if I hadn't said anything?\"", "created_utc": 1566397278.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "exkrjok", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ct5aya", "parent_id": "t1_exj9wt4", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/ct5aya/matrix_4_officially_a_go_with_keanu_reeves/exkrjok/", "score": 11, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "ProbeUranus", "author_id": "pkfdy", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "It was explained in [Matrix 3](https://youtu.be/Q-VPKuKvOvc?t=51)\n\n\n>Neo: Tell me how I separated my mind from my body without jacking in.

He is the opposite of Neo and the stronger Neo became the stronger Smith does. Neo in the way he \"exploded Agent Smith\" in the first film rewrote his code and it changed him from doing his programmed duties of being an Agent and he chose to multiply and destroy everything because he hates choice. Also he is the opposite of Neo that needs to balance out the equation of Neo. Smith dies after Neo reconnects with the Source in Machine City and allows Agent Smith to assimilate him however in doing so Smith is now connected back to the source again and Deus Ex Machina (the baby face robot floating in Machine City) was able to purge/delete Agent Smith like originally and reboot the Matrix since Neo brought the code back to the Source cleaning it of the virus. \n\n>Oracle: Everything that has a beginning has an end.
