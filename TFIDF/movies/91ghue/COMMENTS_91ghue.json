The Australian film industry, much like most of the land mass, it is a desert.\n\nSource: am in the Australian film industry.\n\nEdit: to the many quality films listed below, I completely agree! The key word in my comment is 'years.' In the American film industry in a single year you'll get a lot of turds, but there'll be an any number of gems.\n\nHere no one funds much to begin with so the well runs dry pretty quick. And why should they? Films that don't have brand recognition fail to get viewers in seats to begin with, let alone Australian films. Very, very often they don't make their money back.\n\nIt's not through lack of effort or talent either - some recent favourites of mine include The Dressmaker and Brother's Nest. But with Brother's Nest there was 12 years between that and Clayton Jacobson's last film, Kenny, in which no one would fund anything he made. I hung out with him after a Q&A recently and called the Australian industry an enthusiastic hobby more than anything else.\n\nAlso in terms of producing great actor's, I'll agree. But I wish they'd stop bloody running off to America. I have an appreciation for Hugo Weaving because he's condemned the same thing and does a lot of Australian film (or as much as one can do in the climate). Maybe that's pedantic of me, but the list of famous Australian actors that haven't done the majority of their work in the US is a short one.\n\nOh, and don't even get me started on TV. While you lot in America had a golden age of television, we've had a few great comedies and a few decent dramas, and for each one of those we've had 20 reality shows about renovating houses. And in all that nothing that comes close to a Breaking Bad. I'm sure we're capable of such a thing but it's impossible to break through the mould.\n\nIn spite of all that I try to remain optimistic, and hope each big Australian-American film breathes a little more life into the industry (ala your Fury Roads and Ragnaroks).

I got vibes like JJ was trying to prove his capability to direct Star Wars with 2009 and Into Darkness. As a result, they feel like action adventure films with a strange Star Trek label. Not to say 2009 is bad, but Beyond is much more 'Trek'. Everyone was relatively in-character  (Spock stopped getting pissed all the time) and they killed off the stupid romance plot. The fact that they spend the whole movie around one planet really gives it a \"Star Trek: Insurrection\" vibe, but obviously with a bit more action. Sure, the first two felt more 'epic', but Beyond felt way more restrained.
