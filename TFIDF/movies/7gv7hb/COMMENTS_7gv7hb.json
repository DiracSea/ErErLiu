Many people say it can't be understood. They are wrong. There is a clear story hidden there.\n\nHere is an explanation that I wrote several months ago.\n\n#This is all SPOILERS for Mulholland Drive\n\n----\n\nI saw it because it was highly rated. I realized I was totally lost near the end, and started looking up explanations. I saw a few that were garbage, but then a couple that were onto something. Finally, I found a website with a huge analysis. I think it may have been [this one.](http://www.mulholland-drive.net/analysis/analysis01.htm)\n\nI'll try to give a summary of it, because it's huge, but I haven't seen it in many years, so I might mess up a bit.\n\n----\n\nFirst, you need to understand that most of the movie is a dream, and that's what makes the movie so great. You have this story about a woman named Diane that you will mostly understand through dream analysis. There's no clear demarcation of present day, dream, or flashbacks, which makes the movie (deliberately) confusing.\n\nDiane came to Hollywood to be an actress, but she didn't get anywhere, and is presently working as a waitress. The movie starts off with her having just switched apartments because she is trying to hide from detectives who are investigating a murder. The victim was an up and coming actress, Camilla. This was Diane's best friend and lover. Diane was in love with her, and she had naively believed that the feeling was mutual. But she feels abandoned when Camilla begins spending a lot of time with a man.\n\nMulholland Drive is the focal point of the story because Camilla invites Diane to an event there. Diane thinks that she is finally getting back together with her love, but instead, it turns out that this is her worst nightmare: Camilla is getting engaged. We can see that Diane is shy, lonely, and weak. She feels out of place, and she suspects that a new, similar looking girl at the party, has replaced her in Camilla's life as a female lover. This leads to Diane becoming self destructive, and hiring a hitman to murder Camilla. She soon regrets this, and hates herself and what she has done. We learn most of this through a flashback later in the movie.\n\nAt the start of the movie, we see Diane drop into her bed. That's when the dream starts. Diane is now \"Betty\". Betty is the alternate life that Diane wishes she had\u2014her fantasy. So, by analyzing everything that happens to Betty, we can determine what things went wrong in Diane's life.\n\n* Betty arrives in Los Angeles in a limo. So, Diane's arrival was likely far less glamorous.\n\n* Betty has two older people with her who are quiet and smiling. So, maybe we can assume that Diane was raised by people who were perhaps always bickering and unsupportive, and loud. Their age implies that perhaps she was raised by her grandparents, suggesting that her parents were fuck-ups. i.e. not a good upbringing.\n\n* Betty is staying at her aunt's beautiful condo. In reality, Diane is working as a waitress (and prostitute) to pay bills, and likely started off in a rough part of town.\n\n* Betty is loved by everyone in the industry and it appears she will go far. Ultimately, things fall apart because of some evil-looking conspiracy against her by the elite of Hollywood. This is what Diane wants to believe. She doesn't want to accept that she wasn't good enough to be successful. It must have been a conspiracy against her!\n\n* Rita is Camilla's dream-equivalent. She is about to be assassinated in a limo on Mulholland Drive, but she is saved by a serious car collision, though it leaves her with amnesia. In real life, Diane was brought to a house on Mulholland Drive in a limo, to an event which was, in a sense, a traumatic collision. (This is what's great about the movie. The relationships between dream and reality.)\n\n* Rita is confused, weak, scared, and in need of help. Betty is shiny, pure, beautiful, and in a position to help. In reality, the situation was reversed. Diane was the weak one that latched onto Camilla.\n\n* A new hitman is searching for Rita in the dream. He is a bumbling idiot. This is because Diane regrets hiring the hitman, and is hoping that he fails in assassinating Camilla. This manifests in her dream as incompetent hitmen.\n\n* The restaurant has a psychic who is killed by something horrible he sees. We see later in the movie that Diane (recklessly) meets her hitman at her work. She speaks too loudly, and a restaurant patron (the psychic) appears to hear what she is saying. This manifests in the dream as a \"psychic\" because \"he knows\". The shock on the patron's face when he realizes what he is hearing is mirrored by the shock that kills the psychic.\n\n* The restaurant has a horrible monster behind it. In reality, Diane's hitman tells her that they won't meet again, but he will place a blue key near the dumpster behind the restaurant to indicate that he has finished the job. We see this key on Diane's table in her apartment (indicating that Camilla has been assassinated). In her dream, (this one is interesting) the key is manifested as the blue box (because what else would a blue key open?), and the act of the assassination is manifested as the monster.\n\nIn the dream, Betty hides the box away when she finds it. She is afraid of it. It represent reality. Ultimately, she comes back to it, and opening it collapses the dream, ending the fantasy. She accepts that she has killed the woman she loves, and that the police are close to finding her, so she kills herself. Just before she dies, we once again the see the old couple. Now they are nagging her, perhaps telling her that she is worthless and will never amount to anything, which is her last thought before dying.\n\nThere are many other things that show up throughout the movie that have meaning. Some subtle. For example, Diane sits waiting by a phone next to a lamp with a red shade and we see an odd scene with a man answering a phone in an odd manner. This is supposedly how call-girls used to operate. This is supposed to tell us that she was working as a prostitute. I believe it's implied that Camilla got her into the business. \n\nIt is true that there is *some* interpretation to be made. That's the beauty of it. Your mind will fill in the blanks as you interpret the dream. But the basic story is clear. There are key points that happened. Everything outside of the dream sequence happened. You just get to interpret what the elements of the dream represent, and (for me anyway) it creates a very powerful story. You can feel all of Diane's life-story through the inverse of her fantasy.\n\nI don't think there's ever been any movie like it.\n\n", "created_utc": 1512155108.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dqmefjf", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7gv7hb", "parent_id": "t3_7gv7hb", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7gv7hb/david_lynchs_memos_to_projectionists_for/dqmefjf/", "score": 265, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "MyOtherAltIsAHuman", "author_id": "4d8cy", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "As a former projectionist (RIP 35mm) this makes me smile.

So let's start with the part that is real... \r\n\r\nThe second part: reality\r\n\r\nWe suddenly find Fred (the wife killer) in an interrogation room talking to the cops saying that he killed his wife.  This is the only part that's real.  Fred coming to term with what he actually did and him going to jail.  This part is short in the movie, so it'll be short here.  Now let's delve into the events leading up to this realization.\r\n\r\nThe first part: recollection \r\n\r\nThe events leading up to the realization that he killed his wife is him recalling the events leading up to the murder of his wife.  The movie starts with the mysterious message \"Dick Laurant is dead\".  I'm on the fence on this one.  I believe Fred murdered Dick an doesn't realize he did it. Most of this part deals with Fred denying his actions and making up fake events in his mind to hide his actions from himself.  He and his wife receive a set of video tapes of somebody going through the house.  This represents the truth/reality.  This is something that his subconscious is trying to force him to come to terms with.  This is him going through the house.\r\n\r\nHe and his wife go to a part where the meet the \u201cMystery Man\u201d (MM) for the first time.  He does a trick where he calls Fred\u2019s house and the MM answers.  He represents the actions that Fred is going to do later.  Murder his wife.\r\n\r\nThe next day Fred gets another video showing his wife\u2019s mutilated body.  This is the moment he snaps into reality and realizes the he\u2019s the one that murdered her.  The videos forced him to face reality and he\u2019s sentenced to murder.\r\n\r\nA few details about this part.  \r\n\r\n* There isn\u2019t much detail in any of the scenes.  All the settings are minimal.  It\u2019s like a person trying to remember something, they remember what\u2019s important, not the little details.\r\n* The videos were black and white.  This wasn\u2019t stylistic, they represent surveillance videos.  Surveillance videos capture real events.\r\n* We learn that Fred plays jazz, this will come up later.\r\n\r\nThe third part: (Fugue state)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugue_state]\r\n>Dissociative fugue, formerly fugue state or psychogenic fugue, is a dissociative disorder.[1] It is a rare psychiatric disorder characterized by reversible amnesia for personal identity, including the memories, personality, and other identifying characteristics of individuality.\r\n\r\nIn his prison cell, Fred goes through a transformation where he turns into Pete a young auto mechanic. \r\nPete is release and we notice some major changes.  The details of the scenes are more complete.  We have logos, brand names, music in the background, art.  Fred has created a completely new (believable) reality for himself. \r\n\r\nPete is a great kid, smart, handsome, great at his job, caring parents and girlfriend.  Everybody loves him, including the gangster customer (Mr. Eddy) who will only trust Pete with his car.  Pete has a great life and is loved by all.\r\n\r\nPete meets Alice, Mr. Eddy\u2019s girlfriend who looks just like his murdered wife.  He is immediately smitten by her and they start to have an affair.  This is his real life sneaking into his fantasy life.  This is where it all starts to fall apart.  Alice is really his wife \u201cRenee\u201d, and represents her in the fantasy.  \r\nThere\u2019s a lot of symbolism that I can\u2019t remember (it\u2019s been years) but here are the key points in this part of the movie.\r\nHis past/reality keeps trying to sneak in.  \r\n\r\n* At the garage, jazz music is playing and it bothers him so much that he has to turn it off.  \r\n* He keeps having flashes of light and headaches.  These are usually triggered by something unpleasant, like the feeling of rejection\r\n\r\nThen the finale where he and Alice/Renee have sex in the desert.  During this scene he says over and over \u201cI want you\u201d, at the end she says \u201cyou\u2019ll never have me\u201d\r\n\r\nHe stands up and he\u2019s Fred again.  Her ultimate rejection forces his mind to go back to Fred.  Then we encounter the mystery man again.  Once again, he represents truth.  He tells Fred that Alice is really Renee, then asks Fred what his name is.  He\u2019s forcing Fred to deal with the truth and starts chasing him with a surveillance camera that\u2019s been rigged to work as a camcorder.  Again, surveillance camera is here to represent reality.\r\n\r\nFred runs away from reality, both literally and figuratively.  He jumps in the car and starts driving trying to get away from the truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "created_utc": 1512179057.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dqn0fcm", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7gv7hb", "parent_id": "t1_dqmpftw", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7gv7hb/david_lynchs_memos_to_projectionists_for/dqn0fcm/", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "CobraCabana", "author_id": "gg8jc", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Lost Highway is actually super similar to Mulholland Drive, almost as if they're companion pieces.

Been a little bit since I've watched it, so a few details I can't quite remember.\n\n1.  Before the credits are: the jitterbug dance (which shows a young Betty/Diane beaming alongside the elderly couple) and a POV shot that goes to bed and descends into a pillow.  For the former, I've got a lot of thoughts on the significance of the elderly couple (I think there's subtext that Diane was sexually abused by a family member back in Canada, and that the couple ties into this), but on a surface level it shows that Betty/Diane knows them in some way, which is contradicted by the next time we see them, where they've just met each other on a plane.  This right off the bat lets us know something is awry with the reality we're seeing.  The latter is more explicit: it shows someone falling asleep, and what follows is a dream.\n\n2.  The red lampshade is in Diane's apartment, we learn in the last part of the film.  We see it once (maybe more, can't remember) in the first part, when there's the chain of phone calls regarding Rita still being missing after the failed murder.  The call goes up the chain until it reaches the phone by the red lampshade, belonging to the one who's ultimately behind the hit.  Who of course is Diane.\n\n3.  Kesher is auditioning actresses for the Sylvia North Story.  Near the end, we learn that Diane met Camilla while auditioning for this movie (although in reality it was Bob Brooker directing/casting it).  Diane talks about how she didn't get the part, while Camilla did.  In the fantasy, shadowy powers force Kesher to cast an undeserving actress named Camilla Rhodes (instead of someone deserving, perhaps it might have been Betty, from the way Kesher was captivated by her), which helps Diane cope with why she didn't get the part in reality.\n\n4.  The car accident happens on Mulholland Drive, more specifically at the location that Diane was dropped off before attending Adam and Camilla's dinner party where they announced their engagement.  This was the end of Diane's rope, where any hope of being with Camilla was crushed and she fell over the edge into putting out a hit on Camilla.  The trauma of the car crash mirror's Diane's emotional trauma.\n\n5.  The hitman gives a key once the job is done, that is to say once Camilla is dead.  In the fantasy, the key opens a blue box.  The box represents terrible reality that has been contained and hidden away while Diane lives out the fantasy.  Once the box is opened with that key, the fantasy collapses and Diane is again confronted with what she did.\n\n6.  The last part of the film is not in chronological order, and the bathrobe (which goes from clean to dingy), the ashtray shaped like a piano (which Diane's neighbor takes back at a certain point), and the coffee cup (hmm... not sure about this one) help you keep track of chronology.\n\n7.  Club Silencio represents how we allow ourselves to believe things we know to be false, even if only temporarily.  We are told repeatedly that all the sounds are pre-recorded, yet it is incredibly easy to forget this during the performance of \"Llorando\", because of how passionate the performance is, until the illusion is rudely shattered.  This is a metaphor both for Diane's fantasy and how it will inevitably collapse and also for movies/Hollywood and the fantasy surrounding them, which the film is highly critical of.  I also think Club Silencio factors into the sexual abuse subtext.\n\n8.  Well, Diane certainly seems to think that other factors helped Camilla.  In the fantasy, Camilla hams her way through her lip synch audition but gets the part because gangsters are forcing the director's hand.  Diane on some level believes that real Camilla's success is at least partially unearned, because this helps Diane rationalize why she was not as successful in her acting career.\n\n9.  The man behind Winkie's represents the evil that Diane created when she put the hit on Camilla (which she did at that Winkie's).  In the fantasy, the man who observed her at Winkie's has some inkling of something evil afoot, but he is killed so there are no witnesses (putting the evil out of mind) and the fantasy can proceed.  At the end, the man behind Winkie's unleashes the elderly couple to torment Diane, making her finally face what she did before she kills herself.\n\n10.  Aunt Ruth is filming in Canada (I think?) in the fantasy.  In reality, Diane tells people she came to Hollywood (from Canada) because her Aunt Ruth left her some money.  I believe Aunt Ruth is a fiction (A Untruth?) that Diane uses to conceal the real reason she came to Hollywood: to escape her familial abuse in Canada.", "created_utc": 1512174594.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dqmwy2e", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7gv7hb", "parent_id": "t1_dqmj1e3", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7gv7hb/david_lynchs_memos_to_projectionists_for/dqmwy2e/", "score": 48, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "buyacanary", "author_id": "3mwgr", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Yeah I didn't get any further insight in knowing any of these clues.
