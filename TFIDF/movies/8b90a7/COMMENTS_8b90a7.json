On the call, MILLER said the woman, who he described this time as having red hair and a red scarf, was carrying a \u201cblack bag carry on suitcase with a handle.\u201d  He said she kept checking her bag without taking anything out; kept asking the First Class attendant what the next stop was, and seemed to want to get off the train and leave her bag behind.  The officer detected slurring in MILLER\u2019s voice and asked if he had consumed alcohol that day.  MILLER replied that he had consumed \u201cone glass of red wine.\u201d  Asked if he suffered from mental illness, MILLER replied \u201cno, absolutely not.
