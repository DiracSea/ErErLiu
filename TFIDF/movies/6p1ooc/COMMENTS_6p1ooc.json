They dont even get a category so movies like The Martian get recognized as a god damn comedy. \n\n**edit: couln't let this gem of a reply by u/neotropic9 get buried:**\n\n>It's no wonder The Martian took best comedy.\nDamon's comedic timing was consistently on point. The role was a departure from Damon's typically dramatic films, and he nailed it. The Martian is a laugh-a-minute romp. The film follows funny man Watney across the 4th planet from our sun, interspersed with scenes of zany hijinks from his plucky fellow astronauts. Despite the superficially tense scenario, Damon is able to maintain an atmosphere of playfulness throughout, ensuring that the movie doesn't slip from laughs into nail-biter territory.\nOne thing is for sure, the laughs don't let up. Like when NASA director tells the audience, \u201cAstronaut Mark Watney... was killed.\u201d Of course, we know better! Imagine NASAs surprise when a lowly analyst finds out that Mark Watney has been moving things around on the planet of Mars. He's not actually dead, but stranded. Whoops! But if you think they're going to tell the crew, you've got another thing coming. Wait until you see how NASA's director tries to weasel out of letting the crew know -and then trying to nix the rescue mission! After that fiasco, we see one of the greatest comedic twists of the movie, when Watney's captain, deciding to violate mission orders to save the life of a crew member, says, \u201cthis is mutiny.\u201d\nStranded on Mars, Watney's survival becomes increasingly unlikely. The people of Earth wait for the inevitable. But then, by combining the science and engineering of his friends at NASA, the bravery of his crew, and his own force of will, Watney is able to travel to another vessel and modify it for a triumphant escape, in an ending that can only be described as hilarious. Knocked unconscious by the g-force (good gracious!) and then woken up only to find he has broken ribs (ha!) Watney has to leap into the arms of a fellow astronaut on the end of a tether (that's a new one!). Needless to say, the audience was left in stitches. (Speaking of stitches, one of the film's strongest comedic moments comes when Watney is forced to sew up his own bleeding wounds, grimacing and shaking throughout.)\nIt's no wonder The Martian picked up Best Comedy.

The role was a departure from Damon's typically dramatic films, and he nailed it. The Martian is a laugh-a-minute romp. The film follows funny man Watney across the 4th planet from our sun, interspersed with scenes of zany hijinks from his plucky fellow astronauts. Despite the superficially tense scenario, Damon is able to maintain an atmosphere of playfulness throughout, ensuring that the movie doesn't slip from laughs into nail-biter territory.\n\nOne thing is for sure, the laughs don't let up. Like when NASA director tells the audience, \u201cAstronaut Mark Watney... was killed.\u201d Of course, we know better! Imagine NASAs surprise when a lowly analyst finds out that Mark Watney has been moving things around on the planet of Mars. He's not actually dead, but stranded. Whoops! But if you think they're going to tell the crew, you've got another thing coming. Wait until you see how NASA's director tries to weasel out of letting the crew know -and then trying to nix the rescue mission! After that fiasco, we see one of the greatest comedic twists of the movie, when Watney's captain, deciding to violate mission orders to save the life of a crew member, says, \u201cthis is mutiny.\u201d\n\nStranded on Mars, Watney's survival becomes increasingly unlikely. The people of Earth wait for the inevitable. But then, by combining the science and engineering of his friends at NASA, the bravery of his crew, and his own force of will, Watney is able to travel to another vessel and modify it for a triumphant escape, in an ending that can only be described as hilarious. Knocked unconscious by the g-force (good gracious!) and then woken up only to find he has broken ribs (ha!) Watney has to leap into the arms of a fellow astronaut on the end of a tether (that's a new one!). Needless to say, the audience was left in stitches. (Speaking of stitches, one of the film's strongest comedic moments comes when Watney is forced to sew up his own bleeding wounds, grimacing and shaking throughout.)\n\nIt's no wonder The Martian picked up Best Comedy.

Reminded me of Avatar a movie I really didnt enjoy very much as it was all about how destroying the environment is so evil and why cant we just live in harmony with the environment like the Avatar aliens do. Well maybe if we could ride flying bird things to our jobs we could. It was again over-preachy and felt very forced.

It's been awhile since I'd seen it and there were things I had never picked up on. I'm sure I'm the slowpoke to this realization, but the way Ripley acts in the beginning is so much like (not sure how to put this) someone who has been sexually abused. It mirrors the violation, having something alien inside you (on the nose), battling with the nightmares and depression, and the incredibly courageous act of staring your fear in the face and facing it, which Ripley does when she changes her mind and takes on the mission.\n\nWeaver's acting is so intense and raw. In a way, it's almost a shame, because I've never been able to Sigourney Weaver as anything but Ripley. Even in Ghostbusters. Everything she does as Ripley is completely believable and she conveys so much with her face, it's astonishing.\n\nRipley consistently stands up for herself throughout the movie, she demands respect and backs it up with her actions. When she's briefing the crew and they're acting flippant, she takes control and makes her point in all seriousness. \n\nThe compassion she has and the empathy she shows towards Newt is very powerful too, and simply acted. She knows too well the trauma Newt has been through and what she would have had to do to survive. \n\nThe fact that she even goes down to the surface and doesn't stay in the orbit ship is super gutsy too, she's the only one who really knows what's down there. \n\nOK, I'm just gushing at this point but, seriously, Ripley is badass. \n\n\nOne more thing, it's peak James Cameron (there are so many parallels between this and Avatar I'd never caught. Maybe it's just how Cameron sees stories or something. The same faceless corporation, the same smug, double-crossing, young corporate hawk. The dropships are eerily similar. The same sort of aesthetic to the soldiers - it's the future but they are grubby, wear aviators in spaeships, atc. There are huge, world-changing machinery on both worlds - terraforming and mining. The Aliens Lieutenant that first meets her and the lead of Avatar look eerily similar. Of course they both have ~~Ripley~~  Weaver in them.\n\nAlso I hadn't realized James Horner did the score. \n\n\nAnd if that wasn't enough, it's got a totally bitchin'[Reebok shoe](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--t5bYoQH_--/c_scale,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/abkr6jsh6bkyohbpvafw.jpg)", "created_utc": 1501038559.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dkq7q4p", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6p1ooc", "parent_id": "t1_dkmixnm", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6p1ooc/sigourney_weaver_looks_back_on_ripley_and/dkq7q4p/", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "sjmahoney", "author_id": "3u8av", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I agree.

It's overly aggressive with its opinions, any and all opposition on the discussion panels gets ridiculed or overridden by both Nye and the people he agrees with. \n\nIt's a shit-show and I honestly feel bad that these people were the best they could find to write an adult science show. America grew up with Bill Nye and people from both political isles and all walks of life respected him. Netflix had a genuine opportunity to make a hard-hitting, science-based show that was educational to adults and backed up by numerous studies and tests and they just...squandered it and ruined Bill Nye. \n\nThis is coming from someone who agrees with most if not all of the subjects the show covers. The only thing that's outstanding about the writing is how outstandingly bad it is.
