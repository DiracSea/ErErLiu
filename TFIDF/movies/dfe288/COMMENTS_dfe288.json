And since the movie lost $100M there are no profits to share so anyone who negotiated for a percentage of the net, gets no money...\n\nThis is what New Line Cinema did to Peter Jackson and the Tolkien Trust on the Lord of the Rings trilogy.\n\nhttps://collider.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-lawsuit-finally-gets-settled/", "created_utc": 1570637322.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1570637774.0, "id": "f33ew8c", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_dfe288", "parent_id": "t1_f32zpdw", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/dfe288/singer_from_original_lion_king_turned_down_2/f33ew8c/", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "slick8086", "author_id": "5mjh9", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Yes, but it's not easy to prove so it's difficult to legislate well", "created_utc": 1570629470.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "f3309t2", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_dfe288", "parent_id": "t1_f32zpdw", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/dfe288/singer_from_original_lion_king_turned_down_2/f3309t2/", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "shadovvvvalker", "author_id": "7o9fd", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "no, because they make it true", "created_utc": 1570629577.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "f330i6n", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_dfe288", "parent_id": "t1_f32zpdw", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/dfe288/singer_from_original_lion_king_turned_down_2/f330i6n/", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "muffinmonk", "author_id": "4aj3l", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I LOL'd out loud", "created_utc": 1570630463.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "f332abo", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_dfe288", "parent_id": "t1_f32zpdw", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/dfe288/singer_from_original_lion_king_turned_down_2/f332abo/", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "viperex", "author_id": "6r4xu", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Guillotines.", "created_utc": 1570631681.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "f334oey", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_dfe288", "parent_id": "t1_f32ztsp", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/dfe288/singer_from_original_lion_king_turned_down_2/f334oey/", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "rexonym", "author_id": "1kp0013k", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Nans(i*)    ingonyama    bakithi      Baba\n\n/na\u02d0ns       i\u014bg\u0254\u02c8\u0272a\u02d0ma   \u0253a\u02c8\u0260i:t\u02b0i    \u0253a\u02d0\u0253a/\n\n\\*there is elision of this *i*", "created_utc": 1570636195.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "f33ct9w", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_dfe288", "parent_id": "t1_f33bnav", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/dfe288/singer_from_original_lion_king_turned_down_2/f33ct9w/", "score": 6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "karmaranovermydogma", "author_id": "5k7rb", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Be kind, rewind", "created_utc": 1570633717.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "f338cmv", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_dfe288", "parent_id": "t1_f32whyc", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/dfe288/singer_from_original_lion_king_turned_down_2/f338cmv/", "score": 2, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "photokeith", "author_id": "339co", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I guess?
