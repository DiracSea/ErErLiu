[{"body": "Dave Batista, unlike most of the WWE superstars' foray into film, is a character actor. Your impression of seeing him onscreen is that of the character he plays as opposed to the star behind it (BR: 2049 exemplifies this imo as I was engrossed in his character for how short a time he was onscreen). Contrast his 2049 performance to Drax in GOTG, whom he just disappears into the persona of his character. Compare him to Dwayne Johnson or John Cena; who don't really go beyond playing themselves. I like them, their charisma is palpable but I get the feeling they are hired for their star power more so than their acting range.

He was never tasked with being the top guy nor did he connect with the crowd with pure charisma. What he had over Johnson and Cena was the physical presence to tell the story in the ring. \n\nThis is why Bautista's career as a character actor is thriving. He never had overwhelming expectations prior to his first big role. It was a part of an ensemble to a team of no-name Marvel characters. Exceeding expectations there coupled with not being the most household name from the WWE is what put Big Dave over the top. You couldn't have cast Johnson or Cena as Drax without it being a bit jarring. But with Bautista, he was able to be a chameleon and blend in. Now, he has established his fit in Hollywood. And that's not a dig at all. It's much harder to go downward in the totem pole as it is to go upward. Bautista has that luxury. And quite frankly, I think he prefers it that way.

And I think it's also important to note that for any of those actors who play themselves in different roles, is that it would be hard for anyone to match their specific set of traits in a way that feels genuine. \n\nThese are people who are MADE to play very specific character, and it would be very hard for someone else to fit themselves into that particular mold. I think it would be really tough for someone to act like the Rock and not come across as a knock off. And obviously there is flexibility, Pain and Gain versus let's say Moana. \n\nIt's really a lateral comparison too in a lot of instances. \n\nObviously some actors are just straight up more talented, more skilled, or more experienced than others. Daniel Day Louis seems like the go to example, though Gary Oldman is really high on my list of actors. \n\nBut aside from the standouts, it's less about who is a better actor and more who is better for a specific role. And, like you mentioned, Tom Cruise, The Rock, and uh lets say uh Jeff Goldbloom are people who if you have them in mind for a role then THAT IS WHO YOU WANT. \n\nInterestingly I had a tough time thinking of as many actresses who fall into that category. Whoopie Goldberg in her heyday perhaps, Kathy Bates (though she's also super versatile.
