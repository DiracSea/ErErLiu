It's not a western in a conventional sense but the film itself uses American western movies and motifs in it's characterization somewhat. But the Irish idea of the 'West' has particular connotations that the film explores, using some 'western' elements to draw parallels.\n\nUltimately the 'West', in Irish culture and in the film, has been seen as a bastion of older ways and traditions that could be accessed or re-discovered by exposure or travel in to the west of the country. This is relatively recent, really since [an Gorta M\u00f3r](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_(Ireland)) (the Great Hunger) in the 1840's. Before this many Irish people only spoke Irish but after only pockets of native speakers remained along the western seaboard. When the [Gaelic Cultural revival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaelic_revival) began in the 1880's and into the early decades of the 20th century there was a great interest in recovering and recording what had been lost and the West was seen as the repository of this culture and knowledge. Poets such as [W.B Yeats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._B._Yeats) expressed this perception of the west in their work frequently. The linguistic and cultural revival in many ways created this unique idea of the Irish west.\n\nThe film plays with and mingles Irish and American Western tropes and narratives quite beautifully.", "created_utc": 1518380518.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1518380610.0, "id": "du3ercs", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7wu1px", "parent_id": "t1_du3draa", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7wu1px/first_image_of_hugo_weaving_in_upcoming_irish/du3ercs/", "score": 106, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "fuckyoubuttlicker", "author_id": "o1d2d", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "*The Wind That Shakes the Barley* is a great film about the Irish independence war in the 1920s.

However, what must be considered is how the political and economic situation in the decades leading up to, and including the years of the Hunger, was (mis)managed to create the environment where this level of catastrophe could occur.\n\nIt has been called a famine, hunger, genocide, contrived starvation and other things and it remains contentious to this day. But by 1845 a huge number of the population worked large areas of land for absentee landlords (they lived in Britain instead of their land holdings in Ireland) growing grain, raising livestock etc for export and the profit of said landlords. The workers were retained on tiny plots on which they could grow their own food. The potato was the only food which could reliably provide enough of a yield on such small plots of poorer land in terms of nutritional and caloric output for they and their families to subsist.\n\nThis economic/political model loaded the gun, the monoculture in the variety of potato used for subsistance aimed it, and the blight fired it. Inaction and strict adherence to the ideology of non interference in the market to reduce the price of other foods exacerbated the scale of the calamity in the early years. \n\nThere was also certainly an opinion among some in senior positions in Britain that the catastrophe was divine punishment to the Irish and others who saw it as an aid to their aims of fully colonising the island of Ireland (an enterprise which was already underway for 700 years by that time, although it had never been fully achieved in that time), hence they felt the disaster should be allowed to continue and not be mitigated by them so as to more fully conquer Ireland.", "created_utc": 1518388467.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "du3m0fu", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7wu1px", "parent_id": "t1_du3kbcf", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7wu1px/first_image_of_hugo_weaving_in_upcoming_irish/du3m0fu/", "score": 27, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "fuckyoubuttlicker", "author_id": "o1d2d", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "You're correct but there was also a similar dependence on potatoes by the poor across Europe and the blight was worse in many other countries such as Spain.
