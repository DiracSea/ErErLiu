At some point in the past 5-8 years, people have stopped understanding that taking incessantly during a film is socially unacceptable.

Whatever.  Here are the rules my wife and I have about going to see a movie in a theater:\n\n1. If we want to see something opening weekend, like a blockbuster-type, we go Sunday morning as there are fewer issues overall.\n2. If it's a film we are seeing opening weekend with other people during prime-time hours, we go to the Alamo theater. It's a further drive, but it's worth it. They care about bad behavior and deal with it.\n3. We use the trailer time to determine whether or not there's an asshole talker/potential problem and see if anyone around us is as irritated. If it looks like no one cares about people talking, honestly, we are ready to go get our refund. \n4. If we do decide to leave, we don't bother complaining to the manager about the issue. We just tell them someone wont stop talking and ask for a refund or a voucher. Lodging a complaint is a protracted hassle that always involves some younger employee who really doesn't know what to do about it. Besides, we've already missed a bit of the movie just by getting the refund, and we aren't going back in.\n5. We just don't go on cheap Tuesdays anymore. More power to you if you do. Cheap movies are great, but if you are hoping for that ideal movie experience with the big screen, Dolby sound, full immersion... it's not happening on Tuesday.\n\nI know that sounds petty, but I'm not spending movie theater money just to be pissed off for 2 hours at inconsiderate people, stewing in a muted range about whether I should tell them to stop while simultaneously wondering why other people aren't.

You get to sit in the big comfy chairs and watch a movie on the big screen. It's big, it's loud, it's immersive. You get to see cool new trailers for what's coming up next.
