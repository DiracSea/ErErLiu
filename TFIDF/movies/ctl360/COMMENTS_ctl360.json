It's one of a few books I can't read before bed without having trouble getting to sleep.\n\nKubrick adapted a movie about an angry, off kilter recovering alcoholic who is trapped in a spooky hotel with a family he doesn't like very much who ends up going bat-shit crazy and gleefully tries to kill them after a little bit of ghost woo-woo encouragement and a lot of writers block tips him that few feet it took for him to be over the edge.  I enjoy the movie and I find it creepy in a few places but it doesn't scare me - in fact it works better for me as a movie if I headcannon it as all the spooky stuff is in the dad's head as he goes insane and the son just picks it up with his gift from his dad so he sees it too, especially if you factor in the mom's actions.", "created_utc": 1566452180.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "exncydt", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ctl360", "parent_id": "t1_exmw6ti", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/ctl360/the_shining_sequel_doctor_sleep_officially_given/exncydt/", "score": 8, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "kayjee17", "author_id": "d3sf8", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "In the book, he's abusive before the hotel too.
