Despite not being famous for much other than being a Munster, this man was highly prolific. He was a vocalist and sang for a good handful of productions. He based his portrayal of Jud upon Stephen King's own accent and appearance. King is extremely Maine in the way he talks, walks, and speaks. It would be an insult for Lithgow to attempt to do this accent in the first place, but it would be even worse to do it and fail. Lithgow would know this being a very seasoned actor. He wouldn't dare attempt to step into a dead man's shoes, especially if his failure to respect that also ended in a failure to do it properly. He seems like he's going to put his own touch on it, and that is 100% fine with me. If you're going to remake the film, you ought to do it slightly different to make it interesting. \n\nFor instance, Jason Clarke sounds like he's put the Maine/East accent into his character a bit more than Dale Midkiff did, who is the original Louis Creed. You can see Clarke is being a bid more woodsy and outdoorsy, whereas Midkiff seemed to adopt the idea that him portraying a doctor meant he should be more reserved and formal. This is a good thing though. A remake, again, should be slightly different in characters if it's retaining 90% of the script.\n\nI think I should also say, though he doesn't sound like it, Lithgow does have a New Yorkish and even slightly Maine-ish accent. It's extremely subtle but you'll notice it more when he's emphasizing certain words or speaking in a more assertive and loud manner. I can't think of a film right now where you can hear it really well, but it's there. His normal speaking tone and voice is upstate New Yorkish, and in the trailer I heard a bit of Maine in there. Overall though you wouldn't place his tone and accent as being from anywhere but a place like New York, Rhode Island, maybe Vermont. He has that sound, although again, it's more uptown than the rural folks who put drawl and emphasis on words.", "created_utc": 1549555713.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "efy8tbl", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_ao42ag", "parent_id": "t1_efxzh08", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/ao42ag/new_poster_for_pet_semetary/efy8tbl/", "score": 20, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "mistershoe88", "author_id": "pltfi", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Really?
