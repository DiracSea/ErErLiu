In the original ending, Hancock is basically an unstoppable monster who kidnaps a woman, kills a bunch of police trying to rescue her, and then tries to kill himself. \nGranted, that ending probably never would have made it to production, and the movie was stuck in development hell for a long time. Still, it would have been an interesting subversion of a super hero movie to see someone like superman without the moral compass.

I think it\u2019s more a mental kind of laziness. Very smart people can have this attitude towards a lot of things such as movies. People approach film as a consumable that should require zero mental energy, which I guess is valid for entertainment but is a problem where art intersects with that.\n\nNo offence to Americans, but having the bulk of film money come from the US worsens the problem. There seems to be a practice of always remaking stuff from UK, Europe, Australia, NZ, etc.  The way the US version ends up being different is this blunt, exaggerated, often cliche version of the original. It enables this approach to film as something within the safe narrow confines of what people already know.\n\nFor example, there\u2019s a good Australian film called Animal Kingdom based on a real life crime family in Melbourne with some great performances too. It was transformed into an American TV series of the same name, reset as a crime family in California, with the same plot points but this very classic melodramatic American style that overexplains what was nicely understated in the film and that loses what was unique or interesting about the original. \n\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of potentially good movies marred or even ruined by overexplaining. I found it confusing that people found Inception confusing. Primer is confusing.

She was again raped at the beginning of the film in the subway. It is not clear whether she started repressing memories that invoke hallucinations from this point on or if she has always done this. From her cold, distanced behaviour towards her family and that she could never accept the love of her mother, let alone her father, showed that it was likely there was a traumatic past. It seems like her mother knew about the abuse and keeps trying to 'make up for it' with superficial niceities, she herself is clearly filled with repressed guilt. That cowboy hat played a role in the trauma as well, which can be seen to her reaction to it and her 'hallucinations' with the father of the young girl in the hat.\n\nShe subconsciously made up the memory of the guy floating on air as she could mentally not cope with the reality of her rape. The subsequent, alien-like manifestations represent the guidance of her subconsciousness. Their role is a bit blurry, maybe I'd need to watch it again, but maybe it's intended like that. The 'angels' protect her from her memories. Repression in traumatised victims is usually actually a rather healthy response to trauma; Or let's say, not thinking about it and just moving on. Many people seem to think that facing the trauma or reaching some sort of closure would be healthy, but that's far from the reality. So the aliens/angels/the subconsciousness actually protect her.\nThe young girl isn't real. She was probably never there, or maybe left the kindergarten sometime and the protagonist started imagining her. She is trying to protect her (past) self, be the person she wished she had when she was a child. It's a way of realising and reflecting on herself without having to face the reality that it was her who was the victim.

Kaye disowned the final cut of the film, as he did not approve of its quality.[2] He unsuccessfully attempted to have his name removed from the credits.[3][4] The final cut was critically lauded and Norton was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance in the film.\n\n> The battle over artistic control of the film, which has become part of Hollywood folklore, all but destroyed Kaye's career. He delivered his original cut on time and within budget \u2013 but when the producer, New Line Cinema, insisted on changes, the arguments began.\n\n> The debate quickly escalated. Kaye spent $100,000 of his own money to take out 35 full-page ads in the Hollywood trade press denouncing Norton and the producer, using quotations from a variety of people from John Lennon to Abraham Lincoln. He attended a meeting at New Line to which (to ease negotiations) he brought a Catholic priest, a Jewish rabbi and a Tibetan monk. When the company offered him an additional eight weeks to re-cut the film, he said he'd discovered a new vision and needed a year to remake it, and flew to the Caribbean to have the script rewritten by the Nobel Prize-winning poet Derek Walcott. Finally, when the Directors Guild refused to let him remove his name from the New Line version of the film, he demanded it to be credited to 'Humpty Dumpty' instead, and filed a $200 million lawsuit when the company refused.[5]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Kaye_(director)", "created_utc": 1522361078.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dwhzf13", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_881vur", "parent_id": "t1_dwhxlcg", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/881vur/my_friend_wrote_and_directed_a_movie_exposed_with/dwhzf13/", "score": 155, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Divorced.", "created_utc": 1522373529.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dwibei5", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_881vur", "parent_id": "t1_dwi52ml", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/881vur/my_friend_wrote_and_directed_a_movie_exposed_with/dwibei5/", "score": 25, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Dastardly_Dengar", "author_id": "1rwmdno", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Edit: My comment describes an action that happens in the film, a verb, not who does it, not who it happens to.
