My family and I were standing in a crazy long line waiting to get into the theater when I saw this beautiful giant man walk by with his wife. I was like, \"Encino man??!\" but my older siblings hushed me. Once we made it into the theater, we sat 2 rows behind the man I'd seen earlier. I saw a theater worker come over to him and they spoke for a moment. I saw the side of his face and couldn't shake my belief that this might be the caveman from my favorite movie. This time, I nudged my mother and exclaimed, \"Mom, that's Encino man! I love him, mom!\" she hushed me quickly. But the beautiful man turned in his seat and smiled at me. **It was Brendan Fraser**, I knew it.  I sat there excitedly in my seat, not only was I going to see Jurassic Park, but I got to see my Encino man too! I was nudged out of my gleeful daze by my brother who motioned to the theater worker I'd seen earlier. He had one of those old-fashioned candy-striper box things with a ton of candy on it. He smiled and said \"a guest has bought all the kids candy and you get first pick.\" I was so excited I squealed to which Mr. Fraser turned around and shot me that big beautiful smile again. I squealed out a big thank you, I love you! Then the dinosaurs came on and my day was made.

JD was a fresh new idealistic doctor who worked tirelessly to convince to do dialysis and stay alive, but she continuously refused. She could tell he was incredibly stressed out, and asked him \"how are you doing\"? And all JD says is \"I'm scared\". Then she hugs him in a loving and comforting way that only an old lady could do. It was so cool how this lady kept teaching him things throughout the episode. \n\nEdit: Found the scenes, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gn--7WFOlx8", "created_utc": 1519345369.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "duoj09y", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7zf7e1", "parent_id": "t1_duo4acp", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7zf7e1/brendan_fraser_on_his_comeback_disappearance_and/duoj09y/", "score": 16, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "thefarside86", "author_id": "dwip9", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "90% of everyone will have forgotten about it.", "created_utc": 1519341266.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "duof5l1", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7zf7e1", "parent_id": "t1_duo80v5", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7zf7e1/brendan_fraser_on_his_comeback_disappearance_and/duof5l1/", "score": 10, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "mainfingertopwise", "author_id": "wey88", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "[deleted]", "created_utc": 1519321446.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "duntirh", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7zf7e1", "parent_id": "t1_dunsf56", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7zf7e1/brendan_fraser_on_his_comeback_disappearance_and/duntirh/", "score": 183, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Specifically.....a sad Dr. Cox scrubs episode.", "created_utc": 1519321636.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "duntqe9", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7zf7e1", "parent_id": "t1_duns9hs", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7zf7e1/brendan_fraser_on_his_comeback_disappearance_and/duntqe9/", "score": 22, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "_the_dennis", "author_id": "n245qoo", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I can't believe you've done this ", "created_utc": 1519322113.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dunu99b", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7zf7e1", "parent_id": "t1_dunsdsc", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7zf7e1/brendan_fraser_on_his_comeback_disappearance_and/dunu99b/", "score": 29, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Cabotju", "author_id": "16nmef", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I think the unwanted wiggling around of a finger on your taint would be considered closer to \"rape\"", "created_utc": 1519316426.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "duno1za", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7zf7e1", "parent_id": "t1_dunn784", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7zf7e1/brendan_fraser_on_his_comeback_disappearance_and/duno1za/", "score": 535, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "boxerofglass", "author_id": "11le1s", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I hole-hardedly agree, but allow me to play doubles advocate here for a moment. For all intensive purposes I think you are wrong. In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies. We often put our false morality on a petal stool like a bunch of pre-Madonnas, but you all seem to be taking something very valuable for granite. So I ask of you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there. Although there is some merit to what you are saying it seems like you have a huge ship on your shoulder. In your argument you seem to throw everything in but the kids Nsync, and even though you are having a feel day with this I am here to bring you back into reality. I have a sick sense when it comes to these types of things. It is almost spooky, because I cannot turn a blonde eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric. I have zero taller ants when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness. You just need to remember what comes around is all around, and when supply and command fails you will be the first to go. Make my words, when you get down to brass stacks it doesn't take rocket appliances to get two birds stoned at once. It's clear who makes the pants in this relationship, and sometimes you just have to swallow your prize and accept the facts. You might have to come to this conclusion through denial and error but I swear on my mother's mating name that when you put the petal to the medal you will pass with flying carpets like it\u2019s a peach of cake.
