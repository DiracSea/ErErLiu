With each iteration they've gotten more and more formulaic, the big CGI action scenes get less and less exciting, and once you realize all the dialogue is just quips and platitudes, it's something you can't really switch off when watching the next one.  Don't get me wrong, I think they're hugely enjoyable (like the Fast & Furious movies), but they're disposable entertainment for someone like me who's more interested in what's being said rather than which actor is saying it.\n\nRagnarok and Spider-verse (and Homecoming, to some extent) were a breath of fresh air because they weren't just good *Marvel* movies, they're just...good movies.  While Spider-verse did everything a Marvel movie *should* be doing in terms of plot and character and making the big actions scenes smart and engaging (and bringing the same formula to life in a different way), Ragnarok spun it on its head.\n\nSimon Pegg made a great point about Hot Fuzz; that it wasn't just satire making fun of the action genre but rather a love letter to it.  I think Taika accomplished the same thing with Ragnarok.  It's the *Hot Fuzz* of Marvel movies.  It plays with all the tropes and formulas of Marvel movies, a lot of the jokes are much more subtle (the neck-brecking speed from the silly scenes with Strange to Odin's \"k im dead now bye\"), while some are much more blatant.  It's clear that it's not just the cast and director having fun with the characters but the writing too and that's what's so important.  Despite being such a gag-heavy movie, it hits its emotional beats, the actions scenes are as stunning as they are emotionally driven, the soundtrack is actually creative and colourful and interesting, and (most of all) it's very smartly written.  Which, again, is an odd thing to say about a movie wearing its silliness on its sleeve.\n\nHot Fuzz, and the whole Cornetto trilogy, are masterpieces and while I wouldn't go so far as to say Ragnarok belongs with them, I think it's closer to them than it is to other Marvel movies.

I mean...if I stop being Spider-man...\n\nBRUCE: The bad guys will still be there. There'll just be one less hero to stand up to them.\n\nPETER: Ya, but they won't come after MJ! Or my aunt, or your old girlfriend, or...\n\nBRUCE: Probably not. But they could just as easily end up as innocent bystanders when some maniac with a bunch of bombs shows up, or an alien army appears, or even just a drunk driver swerves onto the sidewalk.

She sacrificed herself so we could get one of the Infinity Stones. She willingly choose to...die, so we could bring everyone else back. If I had been there, I would have begged her not to. I would have stopped her. Barton was there, and even he... <Peter looks confuesd> Hawkeye. \n\nPETER: Oh. I didn't know he...had a name.\n\nBRUCE: Ya. Clay Barton. He worked for SHIELD when he met Natasha. He was supposed to kill her, but instead he brought her into the organization. He was her oldest friend. He told us they fought over who would die to get the Soul Stone. And...Natasha won.\n\nPETER: That's a horrible prize. Oh...I'm sorry, I didn't mean...\n\n<Bruce chuckles>\n\nBRUCE: No, you're right. It was horrible. And it was her call. Not Barton's. Not mine.  Not anyone else's. She choose to do what had to be done, so we could win. Do you know why?\n\nPETER: She was a hero?\n\n<Bruce shakes his head>\n\nBRUCE: Because she believed in us. We were her family. The Avengers. All of us. She believed in what we were doing, that we could get it right when she was gone. Natasha wouldn't have gambled her life away if she didn't think we could do it. She believed. That's the point I want you to understand, Peter. The ones who love you, the ones who know who you are and still choose to be next to you, despite all the danger...they do it not just because they care, but because they believe in you. They see the hero you are, the hero you can be. They make the choice to stand in the fire, right there beside you. And the best thing you can do to honor that choice, is to be the hero they see.\n\nPETER: But what if...what if they get hurt? What if they die?!\n\nBRUCE: You help them as best you can, you grieve if the worst happens, and you keep going. Because that's what they would want you to do. Keep going.
