I hate this. I love twist endings, but it's hard to find movies with twist endings without asking for twist endings, and if I *know* there's a twist ending, I'll usually guess it even when I'm trying not to.\n\nThe solution I've found is to ask people for recommendations of movies that are \"**unpredictable**.\"\n\nPredictable films tend to follow almost exactly the rules of their genre: It's a rom-com or an action flick or a slasher movie, so you know pretty much every beat to expect in the story, and you go see it because that's what you're looking for. But other films keep you guessing about what will happen next. Those are the films I enjoy, and sometimes they have a \"twist ending,\" but often they don't. So that's what I ask people for.\n\nAs an example, I talk about the film *Contact*. *Contact* doesn't have a twist ending, but if you go in not knowing anything about the plot, there are multiple moments in the story where what you might guess would happen in the story isn't what happens, just because life doesn't always go the way we expect. Unpredictable movies aren't necessarily about shocking you with \"So-and-so was secretly the villain the whole time!\" plot twists; they're about keeping you engaged in a story because they defy the paint-by-numbers conventions. So I ask people, \"What are your favorite examples of unpredictable films like this? But please don't tell me anything about them other than the initial premise of the film.\" And some of the films they name will turn out to have plot twists, but many won't. That way, I still get to be surprised.\n\nAnd then if someone says, \"Oh, and it has a plot twist,\" I slap them.", "created_utc": 1566223431.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "exeraoa", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_csfo0b", "parent_id": "t3_csfo0b", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/csfo0b/saying_a_movie_has_a_great_twist_is_the_exact/exeraoa/", "score": 9, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "geekyjustin", "author_id": "d66us4i", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "inb4 the insane \"spoilers don't matter lol i have no concept of surprise and tension being attractive elements in entertainment\"  comments", "created_utc": 1566215109.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "exeh5vy", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_csfo0b", "parent_id": "t3_csfo0b", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/csfo0b/saying_a_movie_has_a_great_twist_is_the_exact/exeh5vy/", "score": 414, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "girafa", "author_id": "4epsp", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Yes holy fuck this is such an annoying thing to deal with. \n\nAnother one is \"spoilers without context\".
