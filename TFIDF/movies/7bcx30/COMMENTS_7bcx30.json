Someone else can/ should double check me on this (I am on mobile and fliping back and forth) but that is my understanding.\n\nAlso, arguing the $171.9m in taxes they pay and putting all of that to the bond payments/ interest makes it a net loss. Disney does not exist in a vaccume so they put a demand and load on the general infrastrucure (roads, sewers, water, etc) that are paid for by the city. The extra traffic from visitors (that the city is prevented from taxing per their Disney agreement) now means the citizens of the city have to pay for all of the cost inccurred.\n\nI have not crunched all of the numbers and since we don't have the details it would be difficult to do accuratly but that comes up as a net loss or break even at best. Add on to that the effect of many employees living in other cities but using the roads, infrastructure, etc of the Anehime and paying no taxes (other than sales) and you have a a deeper impact.\n\nNow to me the biggest issue is that this is unfair treatment of the other businesses in the city. Disney effectivly is getting all of its limited tax payments put back as direct investment into their business- a very nice deal that I doubt any (or at least few) other business is getting. So, this is from the liberal side a big business not paying its fair share and from the conservative side government meddling in the free market to pick winners and give unfair advantage.

For one, they aren't desperate for a hit and the last X-men films (***Apocalypse, Deadpool, Logan***) all made good money. Fox isn't ready to reboot the X-men either and Marvel will want *the* X-Man, Wolverine, above all else. \n\nOnly, Jackman is clearly done with it (if he didn't do ***Deadpool 2***, he's not coming back for multiple films in the MCU. \nHe's also starting to age noticeably, but Fox isn't ready to reboot yet. \n\nAs far as Fantastic 4, while Fox might be inclined to let Marvel & Feige take a whack at relaunching to have new Avengers, AFAIK they aren't chomping at the bit. Spider-Man is the crown jewel of Marvel and Sony's fumbling of the character was painful for Feige & team to watch.  F4 is far behind Spider-Man, Avengers & X-Men in terms of Marvel branding.\n\nThat said, if Fox went to Marvel, they'd probably say yes.
