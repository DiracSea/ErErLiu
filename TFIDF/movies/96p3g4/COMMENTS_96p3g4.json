Instead the nominee ended up being Michael Dukakis, and Bush best him handily. \n\n\nHart was against war in the Persian gulf and so there\u2019s a sort of feeling out there lamenting the 88 election in particular since there likely would have been no war in the Persian gulf in the 90s. Also, Hart was the kind of sharp candidate that saw the potential of technology and sponsored technology-forward legislation.

Basically the Democrats are so beleaguered and dumbfounded that we are in this situation with Trump as president that we are digging up every shitty thing that happened over the last 3 decades to somehow come up with a magic formula to fix whatever it is that is happening right now. \n\n", "created_utc": 1534094126.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e42fzk3", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_96p3g4", "parent_id": "t1_e42d07x", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/96p3g4/new_image_of_hugh_jackman_in_politicalbiopic_the/e42fzk3/", "score": 38, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "DietCork", "author_id": "aba37", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I wasn\u2019t alive at the time but we did cover this when I was in college and it has more to do with the absolute circus that it became in the media.

So WB did more Superman scenes with Cavill, who was still with his facial hair, and then edited out the hair with CGI in post-production.
