The whole government turning on its agent plot is terribly uninspired.\n\nI know the UK parliament is getting a lot of flak recently, but just divorce your mind from that and accept the fantastical elements of a Bond film. I'd like to see Craig's Bond do a mission for M and have no \"going rogue\" shit.\n\nEdit: Wow gold?? Thank you kind stranger!\n\nEdit #2: Silver too?
