(Animate on the twos). \n\nHigher framerates \u2260 better graphics. In fact, *super* high framerates in film are typically associated with low-quality soap operas. Framerate is a cinematographic tool, just like any other, and so sometimes a lower framerate is preferable (and this is particularly true in animation, where lower framerates can be used to achieve certain effects). \n\nIn the case of Spiderverse, the characters were animated on the twos (12fps) in order to \"remove the motion blur and get snappier poses.\" [[Source.]](https://www.indiewire.com/2018/12/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-breaking-the-visual-rules-of-animation-1202027410/) One of the top-priority goals in the striking visual style of Spiderverse was to remove motion blur. You could pause on any random frame of that entire movie, and it'll look like a panel out of a comic book, worthy of a desktop background. This wouldn't be possible if motion blur was there to ruin the shot.  \nHowever, the backgrounds in the film actually move at a full 24fps, so this discrepancy cases the characters to \"pop\" out of the frame more. \n\nThat source I linked is really worth a read-through. The amount of work that went into completely demolishing every single rule and precedent for how animated movies are made is frankly astonishing, and its technological feats alone make Spiderverse worthy of an Oscar.

At this point he's suffering from a sort of schizophrenia, and I believe the dial he is tweaking is the refresh rate of the footage...he lowers it, and that lets his brain fill in the gaps in-between and he sees what he imagines is there, and then raising the refresh rate he sees reality again.

I was a classic rock and grunge kid, and that is where my interest lies. Movies are a little different. I can enjoy modern movies, but I love 80s and 90s movies. There is just something about them that is captivating. From the use of practical props on set, to the little things like all the desks being without any computers or a tiny green and black screen, to the fact that EVERYONE smoked inside of everything. Its like watching a time capsule that you yourself lived in. And that is the key. Music for most people is an emotional thing. You attach emotions to music and events in your life, and hearing the song revives that part of you for a brief moment. For me, listening to Goo Goo Dolls Iris reminds me of the first girl I was head over heels for and she broke my heart. While the pain is much less now, listening to that song brings me back to the movie we saw together \"City of Angels\", and the first time I kissed her. Another song is Wallflowers One Headlight. That one is associated with the death of my cousin that tore my family apart.
