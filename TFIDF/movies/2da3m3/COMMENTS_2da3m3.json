I worked on the film \"Death to Smoochy\" as a lowly PA, and I had never before and have never since seen someone on set like Robin Williams.  He never turned off.  After DeVito yelled \"cut\" Robin Williams would still go with his manic improv.  It was a lot of fun being on that set on days when Robin Williams was shooting.  He had a non-stop engine/drive to entertain.  Really fun stuff.\n\nWe were filming in Times Square the day of Super Bowl XXXV (when the Ravens killed my G-men), and after we wrapped for the day, the production had rented a floor of ESPN Sportszone, and the whole cast & crew went over there to watch the game.  \n\nOf course, the crew had started a pool for the game, and everyone bought a box or two - actors included.  DeVito won the first quarter.  Edward Norton had the halftime box.  And (if I remember correctly) Robin Williams won both the 3rd quarter and final score (I think the score had the same last digits at end of 3rd and end of game, right?).\n\nOf course, we lowly crew shrugged our shoulders when the multi-millionaire actors won every.single.box.  \n\nBut to Robin Williams credit, he took the money from that and then some and bought the crew gifts at wrap.  It wasn't much.....just a stupid \"Death to Smoochy\" hat, but it was a nice gesture.  I've heard stories of actors buying the entire crew gifts before, but - other than this example - I had never seen it once in the 5 years I spent working in film production.\n\nAnyway, I felt like sharing this somewhere, so I thought I'd leave it here. I will forever remember Robin Williams energy both when the cameras were rolling but especially when they weren't, and I will always remember his generosity to the crew.\n\n\nSide story - a couple years later I was working on another film, and we were shooting in Central Park.  Who rides by on his racing bike in full biker gear - hat, racing glasses, skin tight pants, etc. - than Robin Williams.  He hops off the bike and says hello to some of the cast members and the director, and he was still the same exact guy he was a few years earlier.  Just so funny to see him in spandex and tinted sunglasses running around a set doing his improv.

As Robin is/was one of my favorite comedians and actors, we arrived early and sat in our seats primed with excitement for the show. While we were sitting alone up on the second tier balcony (as we were an hour-plus early), a woman came up and asked us if we were big Robin William fans. \"Of course!\" we both replied, listing off all our favorite shows (Aladdin, Hook, etc.) he was in and apart of when we were kids.  Turns our Robin bought a couple tickets in the front row for loyal fans who could only afford nosebleeds. It was probably the most amazing thing that has ever happened in my life.

We decided to wait for Cal Trans to clear it since it was only a small slide...most people turned around.  In any case, after the rain stopped, my parents let me get out of the car and stretch.  I started playing with some of the mud and was getting pretty messy.  As I was playing, this guy approached me and started asking what I was doing?  It wasn't an adult looking down on a child. It was a genuine question based on curiosity.  I explained that I was trying to make a city or something and this guy says, \"It also makes great war paint...\" and scoops up some mud and puts it on his face.  He continued this stream of consciousness riff of ideas for mud...\"you can make pots and bowls. You can pretend it's poop.  You can start a spa.\"  I was giggling uncontrollably and thoroughly enjoying the distraction.  My dad finally got out of the car to see who I was laughing and playing with.  My mom was horrified to see that I had mud in my ears, hair, and clothes. My playmate  introduced himself and we were pretty floored to find out it was Mork.  I have never forgot that moment.  When I was much older, I went to one of his shows and had an opportunity to send him a note.  I thanked him for that day and those memories and included a current pic and my address.  I didn't expect him to remember or acknowledge the note.  About a week later, I got a package in the mail. It was a basket of mud facial products with a pic of Mr. Williams with a mud mask.   The card said, simply:\" Try to keep it out of your hair this time. MUDSLIDE 81'!\"\nThat he took the time to play with me and make the bad circumstance good taught me an important lesson.

Then in the next breath, we tell stories about assholes, self-entitlement, anger, etc. not realizing that so many of those people are probably suffering. You don't have to tolerate or like the negative, hurtful things people do, but if you want to get to the root cause of the stigma surrounding mental illness, treat them with as much compassion and patience as you can.\n\nYou lay around all day and shirk off your responsibilities? You're irresponsible and a loser. You're a jerk to everyone you meet, berating others and putting yourself up on a pedestal? You must be a giant asshole. But then suddenly you say depression or anxiety, people are understanding even though your behavior hasn't changed.\n\nWhen you're depressed, you hide it. Nobody knows how you think you're a worthless human being. It's easier when everyone else thinks you're worthless, too. It's easier to let the darkness swallow you.\n\nRedditors talk like mental illness is easy to spot or that those who have it are easy to sympathize with. Not true. **At all.** The next time you encounter someone who is unlikable and difficult and rude in every way, they could be suffering more deeply than you know. Depression and mental illness doesn't just turn you into the worst of yourself. It turns you into a completely different person. So forgive the people in your past who have hurt you.\n\nThe two things I remember most about my depression was how everyone said if they saw someone in need, like myself, they would help. Nobody helped me. I made myself unbearable. Why would they? But then I also remember the kindness. Even if it was just a single compliment or a little of encouragement.

The messages it teaches seem to speak miles to the idea that, at the end of the day, it might not all be perfect, but life is worth living. Hell, even the rebuild titles are lessons in a sense. I don't think I will ever see the argument against a person's total isolation ever made as well as 1.0: You Are (Not) Alone. \n\nEva seems to put it right (something I attribute to Hideaki Anno's bouts with depression, or at least so I've always heard). Life is not some beautiful or perfect thing in how one would expect. The moment that childish awe of the world fades away, that becomes all too apparent. But it's what one chooses to do after learning of life's inherent difficulties which really matters. Choosing to focus on this isolation is choosing self-destruction, but no one can really blame any person for seeing it that way and making that choice. At the same time, one can still choose to accept the pain, whatever one's problems are in life (and believe me, everyone has them), and decide to continue, deciding to do something about it and maybe try to make a difference however one wants. Maybe it's just standing for one's self and enjoying something, maybe it's taking the weight of the world on one's shoulders. Neither is really actually the right choice, and no one can really choose for anyone else, but one can choose to continue living: one can choose to \"Not Be Alone. \"\n\nThat's what I found Eva has always taught.
