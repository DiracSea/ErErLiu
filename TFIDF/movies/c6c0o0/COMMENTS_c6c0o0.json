My question is this:  *How many times have you seen the movie?*\n\nThere have been a few Coen Brother movies that I literally *did not like* the first time I saw them.  *A Serious Man* being the one I probably disliked the most on first watch, but there have been others.\n\nI only say that because -- and again maybe it's just me -- but for one their movies hold up very well on repeat viewings.  But also because there is just *so much* I tend not to notice the first time through.  The Coen Brothers do not tell stories the way you're used to.  I know the phrase \"subverting expectations\" is a cliche these days, but the Coens have been doing it since day one.\n\nMy favorite thing to say about their movies is that *They don't ever tell you the story you* ***expect***. *They tell you the story that* ***they want to tell***.  By which I mean, oftentimes in their storytelling you have certain expectations.  Like -- and I won't mention which movie this is because spoilers -- *not having the main character die offscreen*.  Normally filmmakers don't **do** things like that.  \n\nThe Coens, though, they tell you the story their way.  There will be plotlines left unresolved.  But the story they tell is the one they chose to tell, and most importantly this:  *They're telling the story the way they do for a reason*.  All of their movies have some sort of *point*.  It's just not always the point you're *expecting*.\n\nSo while I don't have any specific comment that might convince you *Blood Simple* is a great movie, I would only ask that you watch it again.  Maybe you won't like it, who knows.

This time, I was going through a very bad spot in an abusive relationship.  I was at my safe serene place in nature that I've been to a hundred times. I was partially drunk and high on cocaine, which has never been my thing but it was a \"if you cant beat em, join em\" sort of thing with my ex who was heavily addicted.  \n\n\nI smoked as per usual, in my shit mood, and... I don't really talk about what I saw. I talk about my details of my many beautiful, introspective, and enlightening DMT experiences. This one, I do not. I am not a religious person at all. However, that time I've seen what can only be described as a Hell. With the crazy geometric complexity. Luckily, I am obviously an experienced neuronaught so, I tapped into the part of my brain that is grounding an told myself \"this will be over eventually, ride it out, you did this to yourself\" and just sat in my horrific experience for 15 minutes.  \n\n\nI can still see the images to this day, it didn't fuck me up for weeks like a bad LSD trip can, but I'll definitely never forget that moment in time and what I witnessed.  \n\n\nOn the other hand: I've had beautiful experiences every other time. One of the first times I managed to leave my body, I saw the mother and father of all creation in a womb. The father disappeared and wound up behind my \"presence\" they were both talking to me in a language I could understand but not decipher, it was a feeling, not actual words in our normal sense.  \n\n\nThey we're both telling me that everything will be okay and to just go with what is presented to you. They told me they loved me in a parental way, then I came back to where I was sitting.  \n\n\nSo don't let my one bad trip take away from the beauty that DMT can show you, rather, take my experience as a way to approach psychedelics mindfully, because it will exacerbate what you are feeling. Read the Spirit Molecule, listen to the Stuff You Should Know about LSD to dispel the common myths passed around by everyone to this day. I don't think they're for everyone but, if you educate yourself thoroughly before going in, you have nothing to be afraid of in that world.  \n\n\nAlso, the crazy thing about psychedlics isn't that you're \"trippin on drugs\" its that that little crystal, or synthesized plant matter isn't what is showing you these things, thats not possible. It's that these things are unlocking your mind to these other actual worlds that you cannot experience otherwise. It's very humbling and educational.   \n\n\nIf anyone ever has any questions about pretty much anything psychedelic, feel free to PM me and I will answer to the best of my ability or at least point you to the wealth of knowledge available on that topic(erowid).  \n\n\ntl:dr Shit can go weird with any intoxicant, Set and Setting are important, educate yourself(a shit ton) if you're going to drop in.

I can imagine there are short-term (addictive) medications that can alleviate these feelings though, no? Hopefully you are able to deal with this better in the future, sometimes life really shafts us with these health problems.\n\n**One comment** - are you saying that bad trips feel like you're coming onto land? That they aren't as bad, and you can tell when they're over? If so, I'm not sure if you've had the \"worst\" trip you can have, and I'd consider yourself lucky given your - quite frankly - traumatic experience with anxiety. My understanding of bad trips are not that friendly or simple, and they are far less distinct than what you described. They bleed into the next day - the day after that. They leave you with a warped sense of the world and take away any familiarity you thought you had. \n\nThey are miserable. The complete loss of self-identity that you may experience during bad trips transcends explanation. The beginning stages of ego loss - before the terror can be washed away by a lack of self - are what I imagine a traumatic brain injury might feel like, or even schizophrenia. The nature of these trips are truly psychotic. They aren't just terror, they really are you completely losing your mind and quickly becoming capable of harming yourself and others. You can even delude yourself into believing terrible things, not being able to recognize anything you ever knew, for a truly perceptual eternity. So I don't think that doesn't stick with you. \n\nWhether that relates to your panic attacks (if that's what you call what you experience), I can't say, because I don't know what that feels like. But bad trips are relentless is all I'm saying.\n\nAnd finally, **one question** - what disorder have you been diagnosed with, if any?
