If you look around for information on Cleopatra today, you\u2019ll find a whole lot more on the infamously bugshit production than you will on the movie itself. The movie cost about $44 million to make\u2014more than $350 million today\u2014with some people estimating that it might\u2019ve gone as high as $60 million. It was the most expensive movie that had ever been made. By a lot. 1959\u2019s Ben-Hur, which had previously been the most costly film in history, had a budget about a third the size of what Fox ended up spending on Cleopatra.\n> \n> The story of Cleopatra\u2019s making is a long and convoluted one, and if you\u2019re interested, I recommend the fascinating account that Vanity Fair published in 1998.
