It's a 3 hour film that quite simply doesn't feel like 3 hours and it's just so immensely satisfying a conclusion that is astounding in how well it's executed.\n\nThe Russo Brothers, Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely and of course Kevin Feige, take a damn bow.\n\nEDIT: Yup, downvoted for an opinion. Par for the course.\n\nEDIT 2: Yes, Endgame has more CG than Lawrence or Ben-Hur. Yes, it's a totally different storyline. Yes, they're all very different films. My comment however is in reference to the ambition and the sheer scope of filmmaking on display. Both Lawrence and Ben-Hur were famously gargantuan productions and a remnant of old-school epic filmmaking. For all its flash and flair, I got that feel from Endgame as well. That's what I meant. If you didn't, then I respect your opinion. But for me, personally, Endgame embodied the epic feel I'd gotten when watching both those films. Also, those of you personally insulting me in the comments and messaging me directly asking to kill myself, I hope you learn to love something as passionately as you seem to spread hate.\n\nEDIT 3: It's so weird to me that by virtue of it being a Marvel movie, automatically, going by some of the comments here, we're not allowed to even consider the possibility that this movie was a masterpiece. Endgame managed to invoke feelings in me that very, very few films have managed to do. It made me mourn for a character as though I'd lost someone near to me. It made me joyous to see a character just realize his self-worth. Maybe it may not have hit you as hard as it did me but I would be lying to myself if I just went along with the general r/movies mentality of 'anything that has CG or superheroes is lesser cinema' and just nitpicked and piled on this film that I have loved.

He did what Anthony Hopkins was *supposed* to do for Thor, which was make people see them as \"movies\", not just \"comic book movies\".\n\nThe biggest reason Winter Soldier was such a turning point is that it showed you could make a different general if film, fit it in the universe, and people will still watch.

They could have EASILY had Theon get a last dying strike in against the undead lord, enough to distract him, while Aria struck from behind.  OR, to wrap everything up in a bow, they could have used the birds to distract too -- a nice scene of all the undead lords firing bows into a mass of black birds, while in the midst of the birds, the unlead lord was tricked and defeated by Theon & Aria.  It would have at least made everything make sense and give Theon a useful final strike.  To do all of that they barely need to change the layout and play-through of that fight.
