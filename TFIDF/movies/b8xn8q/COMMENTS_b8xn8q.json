Once with the revolver and once (presumably, given his outfit) after he was assaulted on the train.\n\nIn fact a lot of his progressively unhinged scenes look to take place wearing the same outfit, so might be in the span of the same day.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if his mother dying is his breaking point and then he has *that* \"one bad day\" while he's trying to cope with the loss.\n\nHis dancing coping mechanism doesn't work anymore. The trailer also implies the speech is referring to him talking about \"cold blood\" since it's near his scenes with the pistol. But I'm betting the pistol scene actually comes at the end of that day and he was dancing with the gun contemplating suicide. Then for whatever reason the speaker/speech made him reconsider.\n\nObviously by the end something has to happen because he's completely changed / the joker we know, the way Joaquin carries himself post-transformation shows that.\n\nEdit: So watching it over the suicide part is definitely a stretch, or at least tied to the speech because those might be completely different scenes.

It makes us all speculate what would drive a man to become like the Joker, and the story lingers in our minds even after we\u2019ve left the theater and come here to discuss. I think that makes his characters a million times more interesting.\n\nThis trailer looks good, but here we are served a definite answer. A guy who works as a clown who clearly has mental issues as well as mommy issues. I wonder if fleshing out that background so explicitly will work well or on the contrary, demystify everything that makes the Joker a great character in the first place.\n\nI always thought The Joker was by far the most interesting as a response to Batman rather than being a guy that organically turns into the enigma that is the joker. Crazy intelligent criminal sees a crazy guy that dresses up as a black bat and beats up criminals, decides to dress up as a fucking clown and do criminal acts to mock the hell out of the guy that dressed up as a bat.

He has access to a lot of explosives, like all the grenades in his jacket, and he was able to bomb an entire hospital which what looked like a demolition.
