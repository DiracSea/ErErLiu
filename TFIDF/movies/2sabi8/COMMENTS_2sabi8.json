It can be pretty rewarding, but that sense of accomplishment certainly comes with a price: Namely, that it becomes all but impossible to enjoy your own work. \n\nThere was a video game, for example, on which I worked for quite awhile. I was only one person on the development team, and the scope of my responsibility was fairly limited... but by the time that the title was released, I was well and truly sick of it. Not only that, but I could still see all of the compromises that were made, all of the design changes, the artistic choices, and *everything else* that went into the game's creation. I couldn't *experience* it like a first-time player, just as I expect George Lucas couldn't experience the enjoyment of watching *Star Wars*.\n\nFor quite a few people, *Star Wars* is an iconic and important piece of media. I can remember hearing stories from my father about being absolutely stunned by the spaceship battles and glowing swords from *A New Hope*. That feeling - that sense of awe and wonder - is undoubtedly what a filmmaker hopes to evoke, but it's something that they can never enjoy in their own work. Hell, we've seen what happens when George Lucas goes back and tries to watch his older films: We wind up with \"Special Edition\" re-re-releases with [hokey musical numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiDRgDmXGi4) and [terrible audio choices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yxuDU8gims).\n\nWhile those are definitely *bad* changes from most perspectives, I can't help but think that they were brought about by an inability to see anything but the rough edges and problems.\n\nPersonally, I hope that George Lucas *does* get to enjoy Star Wars this time around.\n\n**TL;DR: Creators often lack the ability to appreciate their own work, and instead only see ways that it could be \"improved.\"**", "created_utc": 1421165128.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1421165991.0, "id": "cnnmzls", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_2sabi8", "parent_id": "t3_2sabi8", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/2sabi8/george_lucas_on_episode_7_the_only_thing_i_really/cnnmzls/", "score": 134, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "RamsesThePigeon", "author_id": "59k8h", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Since when is crucifying people for stuff they said years ago an acceptable form of journalism?

Star Wars to me is about the universe in it's entirety.\n\nI loved the original movies when my dad watched them with me as a boy and was instantly hooked. A few years later the prequels came out.\n\nEpisode 1 gave life to a ~~dying~~ dated franchise (outside of the small EU following). I loved the movie as a kid and it drove me to other mediums of Star Wars like The Phantom Menace video game, Star Wars Racer, an interest in reading when I started the Jedi Apprentice series with Qui Gon and Obi Wan. \n\nThen Episode 2 came out and I still loved it, but I was bit older and could tell that some of the writing seemed silly. BUT I loved it for the addition to the Star Wars universe and what it added to the story as a whole. This made me play even more games (KotOR 1 and 2, Droid Works, the fucking awesome Dark Forces/Jedi Knight series, Tie Fighter, XWA, dozens more), and inspired me to read the EU and learn about all the cool stories and lore not shown on the big screen.\n\nEpisode 3 came out and I was even older and even more privy to the fact that the writing was junk, but it was part of the universe so I loved it for that and I continued to play the games and read the EU and the whole nine yards.\n\nUltimately what I'm saying is that I understand why people dislike the prequels but I guess I'm just a big enough nerd and in love with the franchise so much that I can look past all that and see Star Wars for what it is as a whole (the books, the video games, the comics) - and as much as the prequels maybe felt weak they still contributed to the universe in a big way.\n\nI love the prequels, not because they're great movies, but because they're Star Wars.\n\nEnd rant.\n\nEDIT: Several users have explained to me that \"dying franchise\" wasn't the most correct term I could have used. I simply meant that I didn't see Star Wars as a franchise lasting past the 90s w/o the prequels.

It's clear now that if he'd had 100% creative control and infinite budget for the original films, they would have been pretty crappy.\n\nMost of the things that worked in the originals were things that he accidentally stumbled onto.  You know this is the case because later on, he was unable to identify what it was that made star wars magical.  He replicated so many of the wrong things while leaving the true heart of Star Wars out of the prequels entirely.\n\nIf you look at the originals through unbiased eyes, you start to see that most of the movie worked IN SPITE of Lucas's terrible writing:\n\nObi Wan says \"strike me down and I'll become more powerful than you can possibly imagine\".  This was Lucas stealing from Gandalf's resurrection in Lord of the Rings.  Except Obi Wan doesn't come back as a more powerful anything... he comes back as an impotent ghost who does virtually nothing to help luke, or anyone... let alone doing more than he could have if he'd lived.\n\nThen you look at \"Vader killed your father\"... this is isn't Obi Wan lying to luke... this is George Lucas having no long term vision when he wrote the original script.\n\nThen look at Leia being Luke's sister.  Wow, mindblowing, right?  Except it isn't.  It has zero bearing on the plot, and only serves to make a HUGE story that much smaller.\n\nThen there were the Ewoks.  Fucking fighting teddy bears.  As a kid I loved this... as an adult, I realize that they simply do not fit at all.  The original script called for a planet full of Wookies.  THOSE, I could believe would turn the tide in a fight with the empire.  But fucking teddy bears?  Really?\n\nAlso, we end the trilogy with the second death star (SOOOO imaginative!  TWO death stars!  WHOA!  NOT JUST ONE?  BUT TWO?! OMFG LUCAS IS A CREATIVE GENIUS!) being blown up.  So I guess the rebels win, right?\n\nOH, EXCEPT FOR THE ENTIRE FLEET OF STAR DESTROYERS UP THERE THAT WERE HOLDING THEIR FIRE?  Yeah, Lucas doesn't even attempt to address this, because he's a shitty, shitty writer.  We have to rely on apologetic fan fiction from Timothy Zahn to give us a lame, lame, lame explanation.\n\nAlso, let's look at the Emperor's plan to turn Luke to the dark side:  I know, I'll make him really angry.  And then I'll trick him into fighting with his dad... and then, somehow, MAGICALLY, he'll start being my servant?\n\nTo see how stupid and lame that idea is, all you have to do is look to the prequels, where Anakin DOES suddenly switch to the Dark Side.  He has even better reasons to do it, and it still comes off as being totally forced and stupid.\n\nThe fact is, those movies were based on terribly shitty scripts, with tons of plot holes... but we didn't care because they had charm, characters we loved, and special effects that were amazing and believable.\n\nLucas's prequels gave us an even stupider plot, a cast and dialog without charm, and special effects that were so obviously fake that they destroyed the suspension of disbelief.\n\nLucas sucks.  His earlier success was mostly accidental, and based largely on the work of others, turning his silly script into a magical movie.   When he got total control, we saw the limit of his abilities. \n\n\n", "created_utc": 1421170470.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "cnnq36z", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_2sabi8", "parent_id": "t1_cnnmylw", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/2sabi8/george_lucas_on_episode_7_the_only_thing_i_really/cnnq36z/", "score": 42, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "flossdaily", "author_id": "3s2sa", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Because he is.

They're only on Endor because of the shield for the Death Star 2. Their hubris is so great that they don't even consider that the ewoks could be a threat. They're so primitive and such a non threat that they ignore them. The rebels take advantage of this and completely take the stormtroopers off guard. Remember that the ewoks defeat them with a little help from rebellion fire power. Honestly, the fact that the Empire even decided to build a second death Star shows their hubris. After, ESB they truly think they've crushed the rebellion and are invincible. Despite the fact that they did so without a super space station, they decide to spend all their resources on a second one. Why not just build like 5 executors instead?

The Jedi are extremist nutjobs in the prequels. The kill any enemies of the Republic on sight, and if anyone uses the Dark side of the force, they kill them on sight as well. \n\nThe guys they're fighting against are separatists. They want to separate from the Republic. Do the Jedi try to make peaceful negotiations to allow the secession of part of the Republic? Nope, they bring in every Jedi and try to kill everyone. When the battle doesn't go their way, they activate a clone army to finish off their enemies.\n\nNow lets think what a clone army is. Are the clones citizens? Can the clones choose not to be soldiers? Nope. They are slaves. The Jedi are using an army of slaves to kill all of their enemies.\n\nThey also take children from their homes at a young age into their cult to train them to be warriors. Now maybe the parents of these children offer them up willingly, but why? Are they doing that because they are afraid of the Jedi? Or are the compensated somehow (child slavery?). Either way it's pretty weird to start training children at a young age to be warriors. Once someone is trained in the Jedi art, can they then leave the order? Given all the rules against love and attachment, it seems there would be a great many people that would leave the Jedi order because they're so strict. But it seems they don't so maybe it's not permitted to leave.\n\nAnyway there's nothing that outright says the Jedi are evil, but many of their actions in the prequels were morally reprehensible. The use of a clone army is the big one. \n\nI don't think it was intentional, but the Jedi are portrayed as this really fucked up cult in the prequels.\n\n", "created_utc": 1421225945.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "cnoj70l", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_2sabi8", "parent_id": "t1_cnnsmj9", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/2sabi8/george_lucas_on_episode_7_the_only_thing_i_really/cnoj70l/", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "ban_this", "author_id": "atddt", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFBhR4QcBtE", "created_utc": 1421180194.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "cnnw8z8", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_2sabi8", "parent_id": "t1_cnnsmj9", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/2sabi8/george_lucas_on_episode_7_the_only_thing_i_really/cnnw8z8/", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "cflfjajffwrfw", "author_id": "jq9qw", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "FUCK YOU RICK BERMAN", "created_utc": 1421172954.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "cnnrls9", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_2sabi8", "parent_id": "t1_cnnr04r", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/2sabi8/george_lucas_on_episode_7_the_only_thing_i_really/cnnrls9/", "score": 13, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Yes, it's Mike Stoklasa", "created_utc": 1421174705.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "cnnsp8x", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_2sabi8", "parent_id": "t1_cnnsd94", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/2sabi8/george_lucas_on_episode_7_the_only_thing_i_really/cnnsp8x/", "score": 11, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "manhugs", "author_id": "7aan5", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "[Black haired guy] (http://img.4plebs.org/boards/tv/image/1374/47/1374478821374.png) from Half in the Bag doing their character [Harry Plinkett] (http://i.ytimg.com/vi/MJCeNSQU-K4/hqdefault.jpg)", "created_utc": 1421188181.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "cno1mme", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_2sabi8", "parent_id": "t1_cnnsd94", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/2sabi8/george_lucas_on_episode_7_the_only_thing_i_really/cno1mme/", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "LegacyLemur", "author_id": "hm84l", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "It's the fat guy in half in the bag.
