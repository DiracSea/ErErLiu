I\u2019m very close to canceling my service based solely on this one unbearable design flaw.\nIf I want to read a description of whatever I\u2019m thinking about watching, I should be able to do it without having my eyes and ears assaulted. In fact, I frequently skip over titles (including, of course, a lot of Netflix original content) simply because I don\u2019t want it to come blaring through my screen and speakers before I\u2019m done perusing.\nI don\u2019t even see why this is an option. Nobody wants this.\nStop.\n\nEdit: wow, I did not expect my wine-fueled rant to gain anywhere near this much traction. I finally understand \u201cRIP my inbox\u201d. I\u2019m thrilled to see so many people here share my sentiment.
