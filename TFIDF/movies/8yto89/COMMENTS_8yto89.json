He was absolutely incredible and in my option, probably had the most fascinating life any person could have (closely followed by probably Cleopatra or Julius Caesar). I actually just finished the book while [visiting the Badlands](https://www.flickr.com/photos/145592693@N08/42694310334/in/dateposted-public/) in South Dakota this past week! \n\nAnyway, the dude did sooo much more than what we give him credit for today. From Child Labor Laws, to Women rights, to starting the FBI, Food and Drug Laws, and even had the idea for the league of nations farrrr before anyone thought it would be a good idea.\n\nHe was a smart naval tactician, an amazing police chief (who we still look to and implement practices he developed), an amazingly prolific writer, and rancher, a deputy sheriff in the Badlands, a Vigilante at *two* points (not kidding) . On top of all that he was a crazy conservationists and protect nearly 198 million acres of land. \n\nHe did scores of other stuff too, like trust busting of course, winning the Nobel Peace Prize for stopping a war between Russia and Japan, refused a commander position in the army and volunteered as a front-line colonel  fought in Cuba and cared dearly for his troops. He immediately, at 51, asked to lead another squadron in WWI on the front lines. You name it, he did it.\n\n\nI have tons of TR stories I like to share, but my favorite is probably his relationship with the \"Emperor of the Badlands\" (Antonie-Amedee-Marie-Vincent Manca de Vallombrosa, The Marquies de Mores) a Frenchman who wanted to gain the throne in France and was raising money by doing all sorts of schemes in the Dakotas. He nearly challenged TR to a duel and Teddy confined to his friend that he would have chosen long rifles at 7 paces, because the Marquis was a better duelist. The Marquis quickly backed off.\n\n\nEdit:\n\nAnother great one is during the 1901 Republican nominations TR was unanimously voted to be the Vice President except for one vote...his own. He was adamant about not becoming the VP because he claimed \"It is a stepping stop to nothing but oblivion\". The big republican bosses figured he could actually do the *least* amount of damage as the VP because every other role TR ended up in he would make it powerful and gain more popularity. Senator Hannah said to McKinley when TR became the VP that \"your only duty to the country is to live for four years.\" \n\nEdit: because people are asking for more:\n\nTR had a really great relationship with Booker Washington - a southern black professor, who TR invited to the White House and became the first black to ever dine there. TR, as you can imagine, got a lot of backlash for this, and Washington sent a clipping from the *the Baltimore Herald* that recounted a true story of his (Washington's) encounter with a elderly southern colonel:\n\n\"Suh, I am glad to meet you\" The colonel said. \"Always wanted to shake your hand suh. I think, suh, you're the greatest man in America.\" \n\nWashington modestly replied that he thought President Roosevelt was the greatest man in America\n\n\"No Suh!\" Roared the old man, \"Not by a jugful, I used to think so, but since he invited you to dinner, I think he's a --- scoundrel\" \n\nRoosevelt was vastly amused by this story and stated \"I think that is one of the most delightful things I have ever read, it is almost too good to be true.\"\n\n  ", "created_utc": 1531584957.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1531606199.0, "id": "e2dqxd5", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8yto89", "parent_id": "t1_e2doqpl", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8yto89/disney_would_control_40_of_the_us_box_office_if/e2dqxd5/", "score": 566, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Ace_of_Clubs", "author_id": "75wkj", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Please explain for the non-Americans.\n\nedit: thx guys", "created_utc": 1531583791.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1531589641.0, "id": "e2dpr93", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8yto89", "parent_id": "t1_e2doqpl", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8yto89/disney_would_control_40_of_the_us_box_office_if/e2dpr93/", "score": 280, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "One of Disney's goals is the death of Netflix.

It is huge. This thread is discussing the prospect of Disney controlling 40% of the content entering US theaters. This is an unfathomable amount of money we're talking about, and what's more, Disney not only would control what is entering the theater but could potentially exert its influence over every aspect of media consumption. Look at the lift of companies. There are TV stations, streaming services and movie distribution companies. This demonstrates that Disney controls its own content from supply to demand. This is is something that Teddy would not have wanted back in the day, hence my comment. Now, some users accurately point out that Teddy wasn't totally against trusts, as should be the case. Trusts are an important part of our economy. But when corporations control as much of the market as Disney does it's hard to argue that any competition can make an impact with viewers.

How do we even judge it? Some people are extremly succesful but not necessarily the best at their job. For example, I'm not willing to say Zuckerberg is one of the best CEO of all time but Facebook has been hugely succesful under him from a startup to one of the largest company in the world period. And it's what, 15 years old? Obviously, he launched facebook at the right time, under the right circumstances and leveraged his advantage. I don't think he's anywhere near the best CEO out there.\n\nI'm not stupid. I know why people say Iger is good. He revived Disney and bought Lucasfilms, Marvel and now (pending the vote) FOX. But there are so many factors in play and it's hard to say how much is about him personally. His acquisitions is all timing. Heck, in many alternative realities FOX probably wouldn't be selling off the movie/tv production side of their business and maybe Lucas decides he doesn't want to sell to  Disney specifically and WB has SW.
