These settings together create an appearance that we (especially in the US, I hear) are accustomed to as part of the cinematic experience.\n\nVideo cameras (modern ones especially) work differently from film cameras and lack the grain of film, record at higher frame rates, and can easily use a wider variety of their equivalent to shutter angle. \n\nThe result is a video appearance that looks quite a bit different from film. We are more familiar with it from home videos and low-budget productions that use video cameras instead of film cameras, including daytime drama television, or 'soap operas' (so named from the productions having been sponsored by soap companies that were marketing their product to the major audience of such dramas: homemakers).\n\nVideo that does not have the cinematic 'film look' is often described by viewers as looking 'fake' probably because it looks more like actors on a set. That description can be confusing because since the video in fact is of actors on a set it can also be described as appearing more 'real'.\n\nFilmmakers often post-process digitally recorded video to add effects that mimic the 'film look' in order to avoid this fake/real video appearance, partly so that audiences can more easily maintain suspension of disbelief.\n\nAudiences who have been exposed to a lot of video that has not had this 'film look' post-processing done tend to be less critical of the omission.\n\nedit: To be clear, the 'soap opera' effect means different things to different people because there are a variety of effects in play that affect the image style, and because different viewers are sensitive to different aspects of the appearance. While high frame rates contribute, the effect long pre-dates widespread availability of high frame rate video (beyond the difference between 24 and ~30 fps film/video rates). Different viewers will have different opinions about whether a given clip looks 'soap opera-y' and about whether that characteristic is good or bad.\n\nAs an example of high-resolution, high frame rate video that doesn't feel very 'soap opera', check this out [in 4k or HD at 60fps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4AD3KApo1k). It's got lots of examples of people moving around and also some nice long pans that look a lot quite a bit different than an equivalent pan at 24 fps. It should feel pretty 'real', with very high quality video, without that 'fake' or 'soap opera' feel. This should help to show that there are a lot of factors other than just frame rate that contribute to the impression that a viewer gets.\n\nAlso, be aware that there are many different algorithms for frame interpolation. They have different advantages and drawbacks and varying quality. The simplest method of averaging two frames together to produce an intermediate frame (averaging which can be done with a variety of different kinds of filters) can result in pretty poor results with excessive blur and loss of small moving features. More advanced implementations can do a much better job, but they require more powerful processors and still introduce noticeable artifacts under some conditions.

It's actually a desirable effect for fast-moving games with unpredictable motion. \n\nA filmmaker worth his salt knows every shot inside out, and will plan so there aren't a lot of camera pans too fast for 24 FPS (unless they're deliberately trying to disorientate the audience). On a football match or a golf game, the camera guys are trying to keep up with real events outside their control -- flying balls and players running around unpredictably -- which means fast pans, tracking shots of multiple moving objects, and a lot of noticeable stutter on a large high def display at broadcast framerates, which can be quite distracting. \n\nI think manufacturers switch it on by default because they expect to be selling to sports fans primarily (big sporting events are huge sales spikes for the TV manufacturing industry), and the smoothing effect doesn't really hurt news, soaps, reality TV, most documentaries or sitcoms.\n\nIn theory, only movies and cinematic TV dramas are negatively affected, because we've all learned an unconscious association between footage shot about 24 frames-per-second and the cinematic look. And yeah, the smoothing is hideous if you notice it on a movie.\n\nOn top of that, you have the fact that the TV is \"inventing\" fake frames from the previous and following real frames, and they're not always great at doing so convincingly.", "created_utc": 1543993486.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1543993805.0, "id": "eb4idy0", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_a36g35", "parent_id": "t1_eb4fzyh", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/a36g35/tom_cruise_urges_home_movie_watchers_to_turn_off/eb4idy0/", "score": 234, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "alphahydra", "author_id": "buixg", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": " It looks worse than a camcorder, imo.

High fps does give things less weight, partially because ur brain fills in the gaps on a lower FPS between the frames, and also because the fine granular motion u see at high fps, makes things more calm and controlled looking, less harsh and and punchy.  Just go into ur favorite 3D package and slow down an animation using \"time warp\" and compare it to slowing down the footage to the same speed by taking out frames (the way a video editing package would slow stuff down), and note that 1 gives u a \"slow mo\" effect, while the other one makes it feel more \"epic\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn top of this animating at high fps, theres just more frames to look over per every second of footage, as very complex fine motion still has to be done frame by frame to be convincing and not floaty or stiff.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIts not as easy as, just press the \"increase framerate\" button. Filmmakers want to control every frame of the movie and set the tone.
