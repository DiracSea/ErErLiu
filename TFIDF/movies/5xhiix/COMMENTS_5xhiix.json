Like\u2026 HUGE. The story opens with Santiago suffering eighty four days without catching a fish because he\u2019s the unluckiest son of a bitch on planet earth. Honesty, if you were in a boat for eighty four days, it\u2019d be hard NOT to catch a fish\u2026 even by accident. Santiago was so unlucky that his apprentice, Manolin, was forbidden by his Ma and Pa to fish with him. But as the Fresh Prince used to say, \u201cParents just don\u2019t understand\u201d. So the boy visits Santiago\u2019s shack anyway, ignoring the inherent risks of unsupervised playtime with an eldery man who talks to himself. Manolin helps out, moving Santiago\u2019s fishing gear, making food, and talking about baseball. Especially Joe DiMaggio, who used to bump fuzzies with Marilyn Monroe. The next day, Santiago tells Manolin that he\u2019s going way out into the gulf Stream. WAY OUT north of Cuba. Lady Luck is returning. On the eighty-fifth day of his crappy lunch, Santiago drops his lines and by noon, gets a bite from what feels like a big-ass fish. He\u2019s sure he\u2019s a winner. He fights and fights and fights and fights but can\u2019t pull the monster in.Santiago\u2019s leaky old boat is pulled by the fish for two days and nights as he holds on for dear life. Even though he\u2019s bloody and beat, Santiago begins to appreciate this mighty adversary. He starts calling him \u201cBrother\u201d or maybe even \u201cBro\u201d. It\u2019s sort of a love story if you really think about it. And like most romantic comedies, the reader pictures a delightful outfit changing montage, followed by the inevitable interspecies wedding. But on the third day, Santiago is freakin\u2019 EXHAUSTED, and decides he just wants the fish to do what he says and not always swim wherever it wants. So he stabs it. With a fucking harpoon. It\u2019s a mess. Super gross. Blood everywhere. Because, like many men his age, Santiago has difficulty expressing his emotions and fears with words instead of giving in to base desires and imposing his gigantically terrible position on any given subject through unblinking violence. Typical. Anyway, he straps the marlin to the side of his skiff and hits the road home, read to act like a total show off to everyone and probably gouge people on the price. But guess what? Pretty soon sharks begin to attack the bleeding Marlin\u2019s carcass, because as we all know, life is a tragic opera and just when you think you\u2019ve finally found something good and true, sharks come along and rip it all to fucking shreds while dry-humping your dignity with their crazy-weird shark dicks. Sure, Santiago tries killing a few of them, but drops his harpoon because his hands are just as old as he is. By nighttime, the sharks have pretty much eaten the entire marlin. Only a bleach-white skeleton remains, silently mocking him in the murky darkness. Santiago realizes he\u2019s still unlucky, REALLY unlucky (DUH!) Ma calls the sharks \u201cdream killers\u201d. Which isn\u2019t really all that fair, I mean, the sharks were just doing their job and the marlin\u2026 Jesus, don\u2019t even get me started on the marlin. It was just hanging out one day, minding it\u2019s own business, maybe thinking about ways it could be a better provider for it\u2019s family and WHAM! Harpoon in the brain. Who\u2019s the \u201cDream killer\u201d now, fuckface! The hypocrisy is pretty much boundless at this point. Eventually Santiago makes it ashore. Leaving the bones of the marlin and the boat, he hobbles to his shack. He makes it home and crashes, like I said \u2013 He\u2019s super tired. The next morning, a group of fisherman gather around Santiago\u2019s boat. One measures the skeleton and, holy shit shingles! It\u2019s over 18 feet! The head of the fish is given to Pedrico (Strange that this is the first mention of him) and the other fishermen ask Manolin to send their glad tidings to the old man. Manolin brings Santiago newspapers and coffee when he wakes and they decide to fish together again.

Like... HUGE. The story opens with Santiago suffering eighty four days without catching a fish because he's the unluckiest son of a bitch on planet earth. Honesty, if you were in a boat for eighty four days, it'd be hard NOT to catch a fish... even by accident. Santiago was so unlucky that his apprentice, Manolin, was forbidden by his Ma and Pa to fish with him. But as the Fresh Prince used to say, \"Parents just don't understand\". So the boy visits Santiago's shack anyway, ignoring the inherent risks of unsupervised playtime with an eldery man who talks to himself. Manolin helps out, moving Santiago's fishing gear, making food, and talking about baseball. Especially Joe DiMaggio, who used to bump fuzzies with Marilyn Monroe. The next day, Santiago tells Manolin that he's going way out into the gulf Stream. WAY OUT north of Cuba. Lady Luck is returning. On the eighty-fifth day of his crappy lunch, Santiago drops his lines and by noon, gets a bite from what feels like a big-ass fish. He's sure he's a winner. He fights and fights and fights and fights but can't pull the monster in.Santiago's leaky old boat is pulled by the fish for two days and nights as he holds on for dear life. Even though he's bloody and beat, Santiago begins to appreciate this mighty adversary. He starts calling him \"Brother\" or maybe even \"Bro\". It's sort of a love story if you really think about it. And like most romantic comedies, the reader pictures a delightful outfit changing montage, followed by the inevitable interspecies wedding. But on the third day, Santiago is freakin' EXHAUSTED, and decides he just wants the fish to do what he says and not always swim wherever it wants. So he stabs it. With a fucking harpoon. It's a mess. Super gross. Blood everywhere. Because, like many men his age, Santiago has difficulty expressing his emotions and fears with words instead of giving in to base desires and imposing his gigantically terrible position on any given subject through unblinking violence. Typical. Anyway, he straps the marlin to the side of his skiff and hits the road home, read to act like a total show off to everyone and probably gouge people on the price. But guess what? Pretty soon sharks begin to attack the bleeding Marlin's carcass, because as we all know, life is a tragic opera and just when you think you've finally found something good and true, sharks come along and rip it all to fucking shreds while dry-humping your dignity with their crazy-weird shark dicks. Sure, Santiago tries killing a few of them, but drops his harpoon because his hands are just as old as he is. By nighttime, the sharks have pretty much eaten the entire marlin. Only a bleach-white skeleton remains, silently mocking him in the murky darkness. Santiago realizes he's still unlucky, REALLY unlucky (DUH!) Ma calls the sharks \"dream killers\". Which isn't really all that fair, I mean, the sharks were just doing their job and the marlin... Jesus, don't even get me started on the marlin. It was just hanging out one day, minding it's own business, maybe thinking about ways it could be a better provider for it's family and WHAM! Harpoon in the brain. Who's the \"Dream killer\" now, fuckface! The hypocrisy is pretty much boundless at this point. Eventually Santiago makes it ashore. Leaving the bones of the marlin and the boat, he hobbles to his shack. He makes it home and crashes, like I said - He's super tired. The next morning, a group of fisherman gather around Santiago's boat. One measures the skeleton and, holy shit shingles! It's over 18 feet! The head of the fish is given to Pedrico (Strange that this is the first mention of him) and the other fishermen ask Manolin to send their glad tidings to the old man.

Huge.\" to \"Like ... Huge.\" - he added a space before the ellipses.\n\n/u/drylube fixed the typo \"Honesty, if you were in a boat\" to \"Honestly if you were in a boat\" - but also removed the comma.\n\n/u/drylube added a typo by changing \"eighty four days\" to \"eight four days\".\n\n/u/drylube fixed the line \"it'd be hard NOT to catch a fish\" to \"it'd be hard to NOT catch a fish\" - which is the correct version from the OC.\n\n/u/drylube also changed the line \"But as the Fresh Prince used to say, \"Parents just don't understand\".\" to \"But as The Fresh Prince used to say. \"Parents Just Don't Understand\".\"  \nas a note on that line change, I don't believe the fullstop \".\" was in the OC, the comma \",\" was - but it's difficult to tell. But the capitalization of words was correct on /u/drylube's part.\n\n/u/drylube also changed the line \"So the boy visits Santiago's shack anyway, ignoring the inherent risks\" to \"So the boy visits Santiago's shack anyway ignoring the inherent risks\" - he removed the comma. Neither version is correct to the OC; instead, there should be a fullstop there, and \"Ignoring\" should be capitalized.\n\n/u/drylube also changed the part \"talks to himself. Manolin helps out,\" to \"talks to himself. Manolin helps out.\" - neither is entirely correct. Where each fullstop is, there should be a comma. The OC has two commas.\n\n/u/drylube incorrectly changes \"Manolin helps out, moving Santiago's fishing gear, making food, and talking about baseball\" to \"Manolin helps out. Holding Santiago's fishing gear.

Additionally, he removed the space after that sentence. Interestingly, the OC has most in common with /u/kataclysm's version, but has either a colon \":\" or semicolon \";\" instead of the comma after \"DiMaggio,\"\n\n/u/drylube also incorrectly changed the phrase \"WAY OUT\" to \"Way Out\".\n\n/u/drylube also incorrectly changed \"eighty-fifth\" to \"eighty fifth\".\n\n/u/drylube also fixed \"crappy lunch\" to \"crappy luck\".\n\n/u/drylube also incorrectly changes \"and by noon, gets a bite\",  to \"and by noon gets bites\", \n\n/u/drylube also changes \"big-ass fish.\" to \"big ass fish.\" He also removes the space after that fullstop.\n\n/u/drylube also fixes \"He's sure he's a winner.\" to \"He's sure it's a winner.\"\n\n/u/drylube also fixes \"He fights and fights and fights and fights\" to \"He fights and fights and fights\" by removing the last two words - \"and fights\" appears one too many times in /u/kataclysm's version.\n\n/u/drylube also adds a space after the fullstop in \"but can't pull the monster in.\"\n\n/u/drylube also incorrectly changes \"Even though he's bloody and beat, Santiago\" by removing the comma.\n\n/u/drylube also fixes \"Bro\" to \"bro\" by removing the capitalization, making it in line with the OC.\n\n/u/drylube also incorrectly removes the comma from \"And like most romantic comedies,\"\n\n/u/drylbue also incorrectly changes \"Because, like many men his age,\" to \"Because like many men his age,\" by removing the first comma.\n\nThe OC also has the line \"with words - instead giving in to base desires - and imposing\" - /u/kataclysm wrote \"with words instead of giving in to base desires and imposing\" without the dashes, adding \"of\"... meanwhile, /u/drylube wrote \"with words instead giving in to base desires and imposing\" - he also removed the dashes, but didn't add in \"of\". Very weird how both of them did it wrong in such a similar way.\n\n/u/drylube also corrects the word \"position\" to \"positions\".\n\n/u/drylube also incorrectly changes \"Anyway,\" to \"Anyways\" by replacing the comma \",\" with an \"s\". Weird change there.\n\n/u/drylube also fixes \"read\" to \"ready\".\n\n/u/drylube also incorrectly changes \"crazy-weird\" to \"crazy weird\".\n\n/u/drylube also changes \"he's still unlucky\" to \"he is still unlucky\".\n\nNow both /u/kataklysm and /u/drylube make the same change from the OC: both change \"(Duh!)\" to \"(DUH!)\". This is very weird. /u/drylube additionally adds a fullstop after the end-parens.\n\n/u/drylube also fixes \"Ma\" to \"He\" as per the OC.\n\nNow /u/kataclysm writes \"Which isn't really all that fair, I mean, the sharks were just doing their job and the marlin...

Each in different ways , interestingly.\n\nNow, all 3 of them have a typo, the OC, /u/kataclysm, and /u/drylube - \"minding it's own business\" should be \"minding its own business\".\n\nAgain, all 3 have the same typo, \"it's family\" should be \"its family\".\n\n/u/drylube also changes \"Who's the \"Dream killer\" now, fuckface!\" to \"Who's the \"dream killer\" now, Fuckface!\" - meanwhile, in the OC, neither \"dream\" nor \"fuckface\" is capitalized. /u/drylube fixed one thing while messing another up.\n\n/u/drylube also incorrectly changes \"and the boat, he hobbles to his shack.\" to \"and the boat. He hobbles to his shack.\" - I don't know why he added the fullstop and capitalization where the comma should've been.\n\n/u/drylube also, for the most part incorrectly, changes \"He makes it home and crashes, like I said - He's super tired.\" to \"He makes it home and crashed like I said, he's super tired.\" As per the OC, /u/kataclysm is mostly right, except for the capitalization of \"He's\".\n\nBoth /u/kataclysm and /u/drylube incorrectly change \"group of fishermen\" to \"group of fisherman\". I don't even know why you would make this typo. Very weird.\n\n/u/drylube also changes \"Strange\" to \"strange\".\n\n/u/drylube also adds a comma after \"America\".\n\nFinally, /u/drylube also incorrectly removes an \"and\".\n\nAll in all, TLDR, there are many minor differences between the versions; some are fixed, some are ruined. But judging how so much is similar, many of the mistakes are the same, I'd wager that /u/drylube copy/pasted from /u/kataclysm, fixed a few errors, then changed a few areas once every 5 sentences or so, hoping that I wouldn't catch the fact that he's a dirty cheat.\n\nThis analysis also took me 90 minutes to do, so looks like I'm the loser.", "created_utc": 1488652268.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dei9fhs", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_5xhiix", "parent_id": "t1_dei5abg", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/5xhiix/official_deadpool_2_teaser_no_good_deed/dei9fhs/", "score": 1091, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "swng", "author_id": "h69ls", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "The old man and the sea is the story of a fight between an elderly, accomplished fisherman, Santiago, and a really big fish. Like ... HUGE... The story opens with Santiago suffering eighty four days without catching a fish because he's the unluckiest son of a bitch on planet earth. Honestly if you were in a boat for eight four days, it'd be hard to NOT catch a fish... even by accident. Santiago was so unlucky that his apprentice, Manolin, was forbidden by his Ma and Pa to fish with him. But as The Fresh Prince used to say. \"Parents Just Don't Understand\". So the boy visits Santiago's shack anyway ignoring the inherent risks of unsupervised playtime with an elderly man who talks to himself. Manolin helps out. Holding Santiago's fishing gear. Making food and talking about baseball. Especially Joe DiMaggio, who use to bump uglies with Marilyn Monroe.The next day, Santiago tells Manolin that he's going way out into the Gulf Stream. Way Out north of Cuba. Lady Luck is returning. On the eighty fifth day of his crappy luck, Santiago drops his lines and by noon gets bites from what feels like a big ass fish.He's sure it's a winner. He fights and fights and fights but can't pull the monster in. Santiago's leaky old boat is pulled by the fish for two days and nights as he holds on for dear life. Even though he's bloody and beat Santiago begins to appreciate this mighty adversary. He starts calling him \"Brother\" or maybe even \"bro\". It's sort of a love story if you really think about it. And like most romantic comedies the reader pictures a delightful outfit changing montage, followed by the inevitable interspecies wedding. But on the third day, Santiago is freakin' EXHAUSTED, and decides he just wants the fish to do what he says and not always swim wherever it wants. So he stabs it. With a fucking harpoon. It's a mess. Super gross. Blood everywhere. Because like many men his age, Santiago has difficulty expressing his emotions and fears with words instead giving in to base desires and imposing his gigantically terrible positions on any given subject through unblinking violence. Typical. Anyways he straps the Marlin to the side of his skiff and hits the road home, ready to act like a total show off to everyone and probably gouge people on the price. But guess what? Pretty soon sharks begin to attack the bleeding marlin's carcass, because as we all know, life is a tragic opera and just when you think you've finally found something good and true, sharks come along and rip it all to fucking shreds while dry-humping your dignity with their crazy weird shark dicks. Sure, Santiago tries killing a few of them, but drops his harpoon because his hands are just as old as he is. By nighttime, the sharks have pretty much eaten the entire marlin. Only a bleach-white skeleton remains, silently mocking him in the murky darkness. Santiago realizes he is still unlucky, REALLY unlucky (DUH!). He calls the sharks, \"dream killers\". Which isn't really all that fair. I mean, the sharks were just doing their job and the marlin'....Jesus, don't even get me started on the marlin. It was just hanging out one day, minding it's own business, maybe thinking about ways it could be a better provider for it's family and WHAM! Harpoon in the brain. Who's the \"dream killer\" now, Fuckface! The hypocrisy is pretty much boundless at this point. Eventually Santiago makes it ashore. Leaving the bones of the marlin and the boat. He hobbles to his shack. He makes it home and crashed like I said, he's super tired. The next morning, a group of fisherman gather around Santiago's boat. One measures the skeleton and, holy shit shingles! It's over 18 feet! The head of the fish is given to Pedrico (strange that this is the first mention of him) and the other fishermen ask Manolin to send their glad tidings to the old man. Manolin brings Santiago newspapers and coffee when he wakes and they decide to fish together again.
