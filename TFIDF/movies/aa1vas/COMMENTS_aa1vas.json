He broke ground in many ways, not least of which being to help establish television as a medium for carrying quality educational content.\n\nHe did things like in the wake of black people being banned from or ejected from public pools, invited the mailman on his show- a black man- to come in and soak his feet in a small pool. He brought children of all races, creeds and with varying disabilities on the show and treated each of them with kindness, dignity and respect.\n\nThe plot will likely be about the arc of the show- its inception, creation and evolution, and if they do it right, will simply place the relatively placid show against the very chaotic backdrop of the US during that time. The show ran from 1968 to 2001, but Rogers had been doing similar work on the predecessors of the show since 1953.\n\nDuring each show Rogers would talk frankly and quietly about things that affected kids, as well as going on tours of places like factories or stores and just meeting regular people doing things in their regular lives.
