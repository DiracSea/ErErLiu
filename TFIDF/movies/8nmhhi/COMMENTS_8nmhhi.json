Isn't it weird how much you can learn and heal from someone dealing with some other kind of pain than yours. Forces your head out of the vicious cycle and makes you realize pain is pain.

I felt like nobody else could help because they didn't go through what I did, it was my pain to carry. The first time I did group I got it. Just like I couldn't pull myself out of the hole, neither could someone with the exact same experience. I needed perspective. Nobody shared the exact same experience but we all shared the hurt. \n\nI do think forgiveness is the last step. Not that it will ever leave me, but at least be able to look at it with a sense of completion. I forgave everyone else pretty easily, it's taken me a while to forgive myself. I think I feel scared that if I stop hurting I will forget the enormity of it all. I'm realizing it's not about hurting, it was about love. I'm sorry for rambling.
