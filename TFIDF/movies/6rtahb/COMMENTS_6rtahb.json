The Revenant is not something that should make $500 million WW. Sure, I\u00f1\u00e1rritu got some popularity after Birdman, but I highly doubt his popularity was anywhere near enough to carry it to $500 mil. That is on DiCaprio. Same goes for Baz Luhrmann. The Great Gatsby made almost as much as Baz's last 3 films combined at the domestic box office. \n\nScorsese is a trickier situation as the majority of the films he has made in the past 15 years have had DiCaprio, so it is hard to attribute who deserves more credit. I am not going to count Silence against Scorsese because that is a film with incredibly limited reach and on the other hand, Hugo was not catered to Scorsese's demographic audience. Basically, I think DiCaprio increases the reach vastly of some great films that otherwise might have done at best okay.
