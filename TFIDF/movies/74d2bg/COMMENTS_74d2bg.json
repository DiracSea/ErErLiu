Obviously, without the direct sales revenue aspect, though.\n\nBasically, buy Indie scripts that major studios would never consider to be blockbusters for stupid cheap amounts of money. Then, give them an insanely strict budget with no wiggle room to go over. When you buy 60 scripts for the price of one blockbuster, statistically most of them will be flops, but there will be a handful that will bring in BIG returns on initial investment (see list of movies before). Essentially, it\u2019s the same principal as cold calling (for any telemarketers out there), or if you invest in a portfolio of very risky penny stocks.\n\nI\u2019m glad to see the \u201cbase idea\u201d is being recreated, since it\u2019s been highly profitable, and it gives us movie goers a shot to see a lot of movies that otherwise never would have existed.\n\nFor a really interesting look into Blumhouse\u2019s production model, I highly recommend this podcast from NPR\u2019s Planet Money: [Episode 650: The Business Genius Behind Get Out](www.npr.org/sections/money/2017/03/29/521950337/episode-650-the-genius-behind-get-out) ", "created_utc": 1507207710.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dnxv5vb", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_74d2bg", "parent_id": "t3_74d2bg", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/74d2bg/netflix_is_seeking_out_risky_movies_that_studios/dnxv5vb/", "score": 9, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "stillnopickles14", "author_id": "151rdf", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "They should throw huge amounts of money at Neill Blomkamp immediately.

They are making the movie with the most currently popular people and trying to cater to the current trends.

The driving force isn't putting butts in seats, well not in the same sense. Their drive is to create interesting content that people will watch, regardless if it is good or not. But that doesn't mean they don't create crap, in fact lots of time they lean into creating crap but they don't have a worry about it failing or they don't worry about it getting bad reviews because they know their is a market for good bad movies (ie.

Horror is a pretty hit or miss genre, so I appreciated that it was a competently made horror movie with a cool premise, and the score was great. I really didn't give a shit about any of the characters though, and some of their decision making was cliche horror movie \"characters making inexplicably dumb choices.\" I also found there were a few too many moments where the monster - which had previously been shown leaping at people and horrifically killing them - would hang back a bit with the protagonist and not go in for the kill, which is always frustrating in horror movies.
