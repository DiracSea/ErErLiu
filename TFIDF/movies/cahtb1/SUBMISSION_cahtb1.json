IMO each of the films in the Disney Renaissance years could have pulled them a lot of money if they had released them over the course of a few years.  Those are some of their most popular properties.  But with them coming out so soon, one after the other, the public probably doesn't respect them as much nor would they be as anticipated as they could be.   At least Marvel knows how to play the 'peaks and valleys'/ cyclical nature of public interest, and so they wisely space out many of their films.  But if Disney forces its supply on movie goers, they might just find people balking at its oversaturation of the market and so may rebel in their entertainment choices some way, reflecting in lower revenue for Disney.  As it's said in Spiderman, \"with great power comes great responsibility;\" the Mouse is slowly dominating the entertainment sphere but if it can't let people step back and breathe, or delivers cookie-cutter films (which is a downside of tapping into franchise-building or nostalgia trends), the cheese pile it hoards will start to smell and it may not be able to easily escape it.", "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "title": "Opinion: I think it was foolish of Disney to remake so many of their popular movies within the span of a year: Dumbo, Aladdin, Lion King, Mulan.
