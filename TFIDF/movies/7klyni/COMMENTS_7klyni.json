[{"body": "Whoops! Forgot this part.\n\n**Films not on follow list with updates**\n\n* **Coco** - Coco is steadily marching its way towards $500M worldwide, and while certainly a strong US run has helped the biggest single country gross for the film is actually in China, where the film has become a major surprise hit and this week surpassed the US domestic gross ($150M) with $152M. In fact the film is such a surprise success over there that the Chinese film board has granted a rare extension for the film. For those who don't know, China only allows US films to play for a limited run, but occasionally fans will demand a film stay so much that the board grants an extension. This is no small extension either, as it will allow the film to run until January 23rd, a full month extra. With this much expanded room it's almost certain Coco will pass $200M in the country. \n\n* **Justice League** - I guess every weekend since it opened has been a rough weekend for Justice League but this one particular stung on two fronts. First this marked marked the first time that Wonder, the film that opened the same week as Justice League, actually made more than Justice League weekend with Wonder at #4 with $5.4M and Justice League at #5 with $4.1M. While Wonder certainly has had incredible legs, let's not forget that Justice League opened $65M more than Wonder so for it to already be beaten by it is rough. If that wasn't enough the film closed in China to $104.3M, which to give perspective is lower than what Ant-Man made in that country ($105M). Justice League will probably go down as the highest grossing box office disaster ever. \n\n**Notable film closings** \n\n* **Dunkirk**  -  The latest from Christopher Nolan proves once again he has an incredible rare talent to be a critical and box office darling as his WWII drama closed to $188M domestic and $525.2M worldwide on a budget of $100M. There was concern going in that Dunkirk was finally the film where Nolan would take it on the nose in terms of too much ambition. From discussing a moment in WWII history not well known outside Europe (though this year saw not one, not two, but three movies about Dunkirk) to the unique time dilation effect of the narrative the film seemed like just too much for general audiences. However people went for the film hard as while the film opened to a very good $50M, it held remarkably well over the summer months. As expected Nolan's home country went crazy for Dunkirk, where it grossed a massive $75M, though it also surprisingly was a decent hit in China as well grossing $50M over there. Despite this clearly being WB giving Nolan a favor for him making them all of the money, Nolan proved that he's pretty much unable to make even his most experimental film not be a hit. \n \n* **Happy Death Day** - It's been a damn good year for Blumhouse who closed out the year with a great October low budget hit, as this high concept horror film closed to $55.6M domestic and $114.1M worldwide on a budget of $4.8M. As with any BH film that is a remarkably low budget for such a good return, and while not quite at Split or Get Out level it's a good example of BH really capturing a smart high concept idea and marketing the shit out of it, very similarly to their Purge series. While critics didn't love the film's Groundhog's Day meets Scream pitch, audiences did and it opened very well and held fine. Now that almost certainly the studio is looking at their second Best Picture nomination for Get Out, they have really become a massive powerhouse force in the industry.\n\n* **American Made** - While Tom Cruise's latest didn't quite live up to his heights, it still showed there's enough love for him out there as American Made closed to a decent $51.3M domestic and $134.8M worldwide on a budget of $50M. The film which tried to recapture some of that 1980s Cruise magic with his beloved director du jour, Doug Liman. The film didn't make much of a splash at home but managed to scrounge up enough here and there for a solid hold, if nothing remarkable. With two films this year just barely justifying their existence it feels like Tom Cruise is holding on to the last legs of his box office stardom, and it's not clear when exactly that's going to really end. \n \n* **Tyler Perry's Boo 2! A Madea Halloween** - The sequel to Madea's surprise success didn't come anywhere close to the first but did manage a solid pull of $47.3M domestic and $48.3M worldwide on a budget of $25M. The original Boo! last year was a major hit, scoring $73M. Not only did Boo 2! open $9M less but it also had stronger drops. It's not enough to say kill the whole franchise but if this drop continues for Boo 3! I would say kill the franchise ASAP.", "created_utc": 1513639209.0, "distinguished": "moderator", "edited": false, "id": "drg1xfo", "is_submitter": true, "link_id": "t3_7klyni", "parent_id": "t3_7klyni", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7klyni/box_office_week_star_wars_the_last_jedi_has_the/drg1xfo/", "score": 1, "stickied": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "mi-16evil", "author_id": "4vrqm", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "How in the shit does **Ferdinand** have a $110M budget?\n\nWhat a disaster for Blue Sky.", "created_utc": 1513612098.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "drfc0rx", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7klyni", "parent_id": "t3_7klyni", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7klyni/box_office_week_star_wars_the_last_jedi_has_the/drfc0rx/", "score": 6058, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "BunyipPouch", "author_id": "a1s4w", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "It's not just Star Wars.

Avengers was the sixth movie (IM, Hulk, IM2, Thor, CA:TFA, Avengers) and Justice League was the fifth (MoS, SS, BvS, WW, JL)\n\nThe problem isn't the amount of time or movies that WB spent before Justice League, but that they didn't spend the time properly introducing us to the characters. Suicide Squad had nothing to do with Justice League and more than half of BvS is spent on Lex Luthor constructing a reason for Batman and Superman to fight. Which means we effectively had 2.5 movies to introduce and make us care about Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman. The first three were actually well established, but only Cyborg of the last three were properly handled and Superman was missing for most of JL and when he did pitch up they had to retcon him into a nice guy instead of broody Superman. So our last two heroes are totally underdeveloped, then the villain still had to be introduced, their plan and motivations explained and two battles shown\n\nThey run out of time because they didn't plan the character arcs properly. The secret to a team up movie is that all the characters need to be where they need to be development wise *before* they team up. If you have to waste half the movie making a character into what they need to be for the team, then you'll lose out somewhere else. If you haven't even introduced all your characters before the movie, it just makes it worse\n\nMarvel had Black Widow and Hawkeye in Avengers without giving them their own films, but they had been in Iron Man 2 and Thor respectively so we had gotten to know BW well enough and Hawkeye was written into the plot in a way that the movie itself made up for his motivations when added to his shallow background. In Avengers he's essentially jist a secret agent who's friends with Black Widow, then he gets brain controlled and after being released he's out for revenge (until an alien army invades and everyone HAS to fight). This IMO is also why a lot of Age of Ultron focuses on fleshing him out more\n\nThis became more of an essay than intended, so TL;DR: Marvel avoided the pitfalls by setting up characters before hand and limiting the amount of characters that needed development in Avengers while WB tried to introduce or develop the entire team in Justice League and then still had to focus on the villain and plot", "created_utc": 1513647247.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "drg8mol", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7klyni", "parent_id": "t1_drfq4nc", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7klyni/box_office_week_star_wars_the_last_jedi_has_the/drg8mol/", "score": 27, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "RavenK92", "author_id": "zckrc", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Pretty sure he was following WB's agenda.
