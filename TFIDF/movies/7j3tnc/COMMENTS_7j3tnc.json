Since they changed all that, there was no reason to have the other mark. In the movie Greg agrees to be mark, and no other mark was hired.\n\nI think that hurt the movie a lot. Gregs past was just as important to the story as tommys(past as in pre-room). Yet the movie treated Greg as sort of a side character. The emotional core of the story revolved around Tommy being jealous of Greg and Greg being afraid of failure. Yet in the movie there is only a few brief glimpses at Tommys jealousy, such as his hatred of Alison Bries character. \n\nHad they kept some of that in, as well as a lot of the characters they cut(seth rogan is a combination of like 5 directors).
