From an American-centric viewpoint I can say this would resonate immediately with just about anybody here. \n\nI immediately think of [The Killdozer](https://youtu.be/PZbG9i1oGPA). Guy thinks he's being fucked over by those in power, they're abusing the law to harass him. After all just because something is \"*the law*\" doesn't mean it's moral or just. Slavery was at one point quite legal, segregation of schools/marriage, women's suffrage and on and on. So he decides to fabricate a homemade tank basically and goes on a vengence-spree across town against those he feel has wronged him. To millions of people there is a gleeful little *FUCK YEAH!* singing in their hearts as they see something like this. Standing up against the powers that be.
