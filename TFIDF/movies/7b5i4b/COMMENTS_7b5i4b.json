We also know that kyber crystals in the Disney canon change color depending on the user's force alignment. My theory is that the kyber crystal he wears is the same one from his old green saber from RotJ.\n\nWe haven't seen any of the other Knights of Ren, and we don't really have any indication that they're still alive. I think that Ben became angry at Luke over something and recruited other students (who weren't really old enough or hadn't earned the right to their own lightsaber yet) to join Snoke's First Order, but that Snoke required that they slaughter Luke's Jedi first. Luke arrived right as the Knights were finishing off the new Jedi order he had been building and then flew into a blind rage, slaughtering the Knights of Ren one by one as maliciously and violently as possible. While this happened his kyber crystal began to \"bleed\" (as it's being called) and turn red, and he stopped just short of killing his nephew when he realized he had begun to fall to the dark side as well. \n\nLuke's spirit wasn't broken by the death of his students, but in his own lack of self-discipline. When he says he's scared of Rey's power because he's seen it before, he's talking about *himself*. He doesn't think he's worthy to train new Jedi, and he wears his kyber crystal as a reminder of what he sees as his own taintedness. I think this is also supported by Kylo's actions in Episove VII - Hux at one point says that Kylo should be careful of letting his own ambitions get in the way of objectivity. Luke isn't building a new Jedi order, and he isn't currently a threat to the First Order - Kylo simply cannot get over the fact that he couldn't beat his uncle and the message that sends about the Dark Side's shortcomings. Moreover, he believes that the only way to purge the Light Side from his conscience is to eliminate Luke to prove once and for all that his teachings were inferior nonsense. \n\n", "created_utc": 1509986903.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dpfj3cj", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7b5i4b", "parent_id": "t3_7b5i4b", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7b5i4b/star_wars_the_last_jedi_international_poster/dpfj3cj/", "score": 367, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "NobleHalcyon", "author_id": "batc7", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Light Luke: who are u?\n\nDark Luke: im u but darker", "created_utc": 1509987816.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dpfjzul", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7b5i4b", "parent_id": "t3_7b5i4b", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7b5i4b/star_wars_the_last_jedi_international_poster/dpfjzul/", "score": 88, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "iamnicholas", "author_id": "kep92", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Oh wow this is pretty badass", "created_utc": 1509979700.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dpfchc6", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7b5i4b", "parent_id": "t3_7b5i4b", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7b5i4b/star_wars_the_last_jedi_international_poster/dpfchc6/", "score": 184, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Whompa", "author_id": "4nm56", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "have they just forgot about Domnhall Gleeson's character?\n\nedit: spotted him now haha", "created_utc": 1509981810.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1509982135.0, "id": "dpfeb3i", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7b5i4b", "parent_id": "t3_7b5i4b", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7b5i4b/star_wars_the_last_jedi_international_poster/dpfeb3i/", "score": 102, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "satanismygirlfriend", "author_id": "md1z5", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I may be stupid, but who is that right behind Finn?", "created_utc": 1509983034.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dpffeyw", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7b5i4b", "parent_id": "t3_7b5i4b", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7b5i4b/star_wars_the_last_jedi_international_poster/dpffeyw/", "score": 29, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "liljakeyplzandthnx", "author_id": "nw1u5", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Ha, and it is in Czech, how convenient, now I know when I can get tickets.", "created_utc": 1509984499.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dpfgs48", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7b5i4b", "parent_id": "t3_7b5i4b", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7b5i4b/star_wars_the_last_jedi_international_poster/dpfgs48/", "score": 26, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "ravenQ", "author_id": "cw1rr", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I want to see Luke have an epic Lightsaber battle.

They are \"one with the Force.\" The Sith, on the other hand, bend the Force to their will. \n\nIf you think of the Force as the consciousness of the galaxy at large, the Jedi attune to that conscious will while the Sith attempt to subvert or dominate it. Or perhaps as a river, the Jedi ride down the natural flow of the river while the Sith divert it with dams or canals. In other words, they corrupt its natural flow to wield it. It is why a great deal of Jedi training dealt with the control of emotions and avoiding attachments, because it makes it less likely that you will impose your own will on the Force and more likely you can connect to its natural flow.\n\nSo by that interpretation, balance means no dark-siders at all.
