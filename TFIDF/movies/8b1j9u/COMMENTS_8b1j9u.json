All I wanted was a cohesive trilogy of trilogies that could be collectively titled **The Rise and Fall of the Galactic Empire.** Thrawn is and always will be the logical conclusion of the sequence. Dark force users could have been explored *ad ifinitum* in other awesome stories, but Thrawn could have been adapted to be hiding in the outer rim and consolidating the remaining Imperial factions for thirty years. Here is a logical farewell to the Galactic Empire; the swan song embodied in a man that *lives and breathes* the ideals of the Empire, but is ultimately and irreducibly alien. *He walks amongst us but is not one of us.* \n\nI love the idea that Leia would at this point be the chancellor. Her soul could have been burdened with the leadership of the fledgling New Republic, the PTSD of the events of the OT, the saga of motherhood. Imagine her waking up with a start from a flashback/nightmare of her torture aboard the Death Star. \n\nI never wanted to see Luke the Ultimate Warrior. I wanted to see Luke the *Teacher.* I wanted to see echoes of Yoda's tutelage in Luke's training. I wanted to see him struggle with gaps in his knowledge, seeking to fill those gaps, and being wary of his own struggle between light and dark. I wanted to see him walk the halls of the Masasi temple with the grown children of Han and Leia Solo, to impart subtle vicissitudes of the Force unto them in their adulthood as they struggle with light and dark themselves and begin to bear the burden of keeping peace and stability in the New Republic. I wanted to see the younglings adore Luke, and for his sense of humor and optimism to emanate in his lectures and exercises with them. \n\nI truly believe that the Thrawn trilogy could have been adapted to the age of the main characters. SPOILER ALERT: Imagine the daughter of Han and Leia Solo, struggling with light and dark herself, have a light saber duel with a clone of her uncle 30 years younger! Imagine her shock and confusion, especially after receiving conflicting Jedi teachings from Joru'us C'baoth - the only other Jedi master in the Galaxy at that time. \n\nSorry, I am rambling with wishful thinking. I mostly regret missing out on a cinema version of the spine-chilling scene where Thrawn calls out to the group of villagers:\n\n**I seek the Guardian of the Mountain!**\n\nSide note: Thrawn could have found *Camino* cloning cylinders at Tantis. Nothing would have stopped the Emperor from squirreling away Camino cloning technology at his private storehouse.
