In addition, it also demonstrates how well you can do cinematically basic stuff like direct your actors or light a scene. Actually, one consistent criticism of the Jon Watts spiderman movies that I hear on and off film critique is that the movie is lit like a TV sitcom, which makes sense because he's done alot of work in TV. He does very good/funny banter and interactions though, which is the important part of those movies. \n\n\\- Marvel's action sequences, typically the hardest parts to make especially for a director that only has a few features under their belt, is actually not directed by the directors themselves.

On the one hand, it's very anti-auteur and has put off talented creators like Edgar Wright and Patty Jenkins, but on the other hand, it does make some slick action beats and enables the main director to focus on what they're good at (e.g. Joss Whedon, Jon Watts and Taika Waititi can focus on funny character interactions, Scott Derrickson can make some horror-y stuff, Ryan Coogler can make a movie laden with smart social commentary, etc.)", "created_utc": 1569966817.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "f2564x9", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_dbx68a", "parent_id": "t1_f24qxga", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/dbx68a/jordan_peele_has_inked_a_fiveyear_exclusive/f2564x9/", "score": 31, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "rageofthegods", "author_id": "bjuy2eu", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "It seems like Marvel or other big time studios brings in indie directors as they notice the spectacular stuff they pull off with little to no budget, and hope they can do the same for big budget films. \n\nAs for how they're picked over others, good question.

That doesn\u2019t fall into marvels  philosophy in how they\u2019ve been making movies 2015+.

They analyzed their past,  and realized that they\u2019re most successful movies were the ones where  they tried different things and made them unique (look at CA:WS &  GOTG vs T:DW).\u00a0\n\nLike it or not, A:AoU was just avengers 2.  There really wasn\u2019t really anything different, plot wise. Don\u2019t get me  wrong, James spader as ultron was fucking amazing, but that was about the extent of the uniqueness of that movie.  And the box office shows, as AoU didn\u2019t make as much as avengers, even  tho the characters have only become more popular since avengers.\u00a0\n\nI guarantee Ike Perlmutter didn\u2019t just step down from the movies in 2015. Kevin feige probably presented his case for reviving marvel from the upcoming superhero fatigue, and disney execs agreed, because they know that what feige is proposing will work. But why?\n\nThis is where we\u2019re going to take a moment to  look another one of Disney\u2019s biggest successes: Pixar. Why is Pixar so successful? I could go for a really long time analyzing that, but one of  the key reasons is that all the Pixar movies are unique and tell amazing stories in different ways. Pixar is the biggest name in animated movies right now, and its because almost every single one of their movies was wildly successful in the box office, but also critically. I mean come on, TS4 has like 97% on RT, even after 4 movies. \n\nBut going back to Marvel, and I'm telling you, this is literally why Feige is a fucking genius, Marvel realized that in order to avoid superhero fatigue, they needed to make superhero movies less superhero, and more movie/artistic. And who are the best people that make artistic movies? Generally, the answer is people who make indie movies. So they hire directors that have artistic visions and not just people who know how to please crowds, because they know, in the end, those artistic visions will make the MCU much more diverse and much more popular than if they continued to make the same type of movie. That's why every marvel movie after 2015 has been wildly successful and grown at gigantic rates. Because they stopped making superhero movies, and started making art (kinda). Obviously they are all action movies, but they are still very unique. \n\ntl;dr - Marvel realized they needed to stick out in the world of action movies, and the best way to do that (both literally and financially) is to have artistic indie directors make the movies in distinct styles, allowing every movie to feel unique but still connected, just like the real world.", "created_utc": 1569967880.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "f257phv", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_dbx68a", "parent_id": "t1_f24qxga", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/dbx68a/jordan_peele_has_inked_a_fiveyear_exclusive/f257phv/", "score": 16, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "vamsi0914", "author_id": "ivlg9", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Well, they are no namers to the public but not within the industry.

So, when Red was coming down to find Adelaide, she was experiencing dual perspectives, and escaped to the life she knew was better. Children often forget traumatic experiences, and Adelaide does as she learns to speak and only think of Red's original memories as her own. What I was liked was how when Adelaide follows Red down into the tethered world, it shows her recurrence of those memories in that place and her more feral tethered side. !<\n\n>!(2) You're absolutely right about Adelaide's knowing glance, and her exchange of understanding with her son that she was once tethered and refuses to be now, relying on him to accept her secret. She definitely didn't realize who she was when she confessed everything to Gabe in the house, but in the gruesome acts of killing the tethered in self defense she starts to remember. !<\n\n>!(3) That is a SUPER interesting point you point about thinking they would be killing themselves! So, the tethered below are clearly aware of both their fractured, denigrated circumstances, as well as they are dimly aware of the lives they share above ground. But the reason Red is so special and introduces to them the idea of killing their doppelgangers is exactly because she was the first of the tethered to ever live above ground herself. To ever live never knowing about their life of suffering and then cruelly having it forced on herself. I don't think the concept of killing the overworlders was introduced to them until her, because she had enough experiences in her young life to understand things like human speech, dancing, the concept of her own conscious, how to lead others, and how to feel murderous vengeful rage LOL! Compared to her, the other tethered have incontinent animal brains, but she and Adelaide are evidence of the fact that it doesn't need to be that way for them. !<\n\nSorry, this novel I've written is dedicated to you, but I'm glad to talk about it with you.", "created_utc": 1569995881.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1569996167.0, "id": "f266ttt", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_dbx68a", "parent_id": "t1_f25h6pd", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/dbx68a/jordan_peele_has_inked_a_fiveyear_exclusive/f266ttt/", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Blirby", "author_id": "172b1h", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "i love you're tearing this movie to shreds", "created_utc": 1569978791.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "f25n72r", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_dbx68a", "parent_id": "t1_f25h6pd", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/dbx68a/jordan_peele_has_inked_a_fiveyear_exclusive/f25n72r/", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "karmagod13000", "author_id": "94jte", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I think >!Red!< does act like she is the >!original!< though in many ways. \n\n>!In an attempt to create a mind control device, half-minds that could only be controlled from one direction were mistakenly created as the tethered.
