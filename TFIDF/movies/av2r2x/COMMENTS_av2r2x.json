Basically, as you see in the beginning of Last Jedi, Finn still doesn't care about the rebellion. He's actively trying to leave because all he cares about is his friends. When he goes to Canto Bight with Rose, he finally sees what all the other rebels see: how corrupt the world is and why the rebellion is needed. Finn wouldn't have attempted the sacrifice like he did at the end if he hadn't experienced what he did with Rose. Granted, Rose stopping him from sacrificing himself was pretty stupid because *the entire rebellion* was about to be LASERed as far as they knew.\n\nSo basically if you think the Canto Bight arc is unnecessary, then you didn't understand an integral part of Finn's character.
