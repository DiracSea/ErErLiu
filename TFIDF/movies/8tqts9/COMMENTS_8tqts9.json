It seemed to be an inquiry into the fate in society of the great black superstar jock. Think Kobe, think Shaq, think LeBron, think Michael. These guys are so phenomenally gifted they seem to defy not just gravity and physics but also cause and effect, death, taxes and the rule on no free lunch. But . . . at the same time, they are marginalized, freakified, exiled, dehumanized, exploited, objectified and generally turned into product. That can't be fun and the wages of such treatment on the soul has never been directly treated in a movie.\n>\n>So as I say: It's kind of unusual, it's kind of amusing (I enjoyed Smith's subversive anger at \"the little people\" and his hunger for the cure-all brown beverage), and then the movie takes the strangest turn in quite possibly movie history, which I will not disclose. It's as if the screenwriters were working in their bungalow one day, stuck on a plot point, and one said to the other, \"What if --\" and the other said, \"No way,\" and the first said, \"Okay, genius, you come up with something better!\" and genius never did.\n>\n>The movie changes course, tone, concern, story issue, everything so abruptly and never recovers as it goes on to become a very strange thing. But of course they never explain it. That may be the most insane part, the fact that no theory is ever broached by which the oddness and what follows is fit into any kind of context. I suppose the term I'm looking for is \"creation myth,\" which \"Hancock\" boldly lacks.\n\nBut TLDR; the second half of the movie was so different from the first its like they stole it from another movie.\n\nImagine if Cloverfield and 10 Cloverfield Lane had been the first and second half of the same, instead of being two different movies. That was Hancock.\n\nI remember reading at one point that this was likely do to the number of times the movie was handed to different people throughout its production, even going through multiple directors.

A pair of leather boots also steps into frame. Camera rises to reveal a man in a black suit, but trimmed to knees and elbows. The man with boots has blue jeans, but still has the short sleeved jacket. \n\n\"Roit awful, these buggahs.\" says the senior officer. Played by Chris Hemsworth. \n\n\"Jeez-O-Pete, that son-bitch is huge! We got them back home but they ain't *that* big. ***DANG***.\" says the new recruit, an Appalachian. Played by Shia Labouf. He takes a swig from a bourbon-filled canteen through a scraggly beard. \n\nWe watch as the two approach a bonfire surrounded by two junkers and a couple of natives. We see one Asian man leading a conversation. \n\n\"Ay y'all! Watch y'all up to at this time-a night?\" shouts Shia. \n\n\"Roit! This lad saw ye from the road and we thought we moit check on these blokes! Doin' all roit?!\" follows Chris. He grabs Shias collar and gives him a stern look. High pitch violins set the ominous tone. \n\n\"Oh, yes, we are doing very well, thank you. We apologize for the noise and potential confusion. We will quiet our festivities if we are causing any trouble.\" says the Asian man. The natives nod quickly before lowering their heads.\n\nChris walks up to the Asian man with a sense of authority. \"Ohhh, no need. We just thought we'd check.\" \n\nShia follows suit and wraps an arm around a native. \"Oh sure. We were just bein a couple good sameritans and all that. Youns seemed to be havin a caniption or somethin, but y'all seem alright now that we got a good close look.\" Shia hands the native his flask. The native nervously sips. \n\n\"Now I wouldn't say that just yet.\" Chris says quietly as he tightly grips the Asian man's scalp, pulling back his skin, as if it were a mask. An alien skull becomes visible through the thin covering. \"Roit. Aren't beings from the Alpha-134 Quadrant under a direct 'No Crossing' order? This is a galactic felony. Do you know this.\"\n\nThe alien struggles, gasping through his disguise. \"Oh, yes, we know. We are very sorry. A terrible tyrant has overthrown our government. We are but stowaways searching for prosperity!\" \n\n\"Prosperity! Well, shoot. That's what we're all about!\" says Shia \"if y'all want some-a that pursuit of happiness, then ya shoulda just said so. Whatcha say, C? Should we let em be?\" \n\n\"Hold on, S. Alien Asian Man, what's this blokes name? The man who made you flee to the bloody desert?\" says Chris. He loosens his grip. The alien chokes, catching his breath. \n\n\"Oh, he is horrendously horrid. Quite the worst, honestly. He goes by Shaka. He wishes to spread his rule. In fact, part of our journey is to warn the Earthlings, you, that he will be here within a week. Fully armed.\" says the alien. \n\n\"Well, Dang. That ain't good.\" says Shia \"C, whatcha think 'bout this tale? Is he truthful?\" \n\n\"I'm not sure, S.\" says Chris \"but I do know that I spy 2 handles of Beam in that junkah.\"\n\n\"I'll be, you got some eyes on you, son! You ain't kiddin!\" says Shia. \"We joinin' or we shootin?\" \n\nChris gives another stern look to Shia, then to the natives, then to the alien. He smiles. \"What kinda hosts would we be if we didn't drink with our guests! May we, Alien Asian Man? We'll make sure youre taken care of tomorrow. Can't say much about the hangover, tho.\" \n\nShia runs to each of the natives, shaking their hands. \"Shoo fire, Imma bout to get lit y'all! Campfire drinkin's my favorite. Just absolute favorite! I apologize in advance for any bruises I may cause, though. I ain't got good control over my temperament when I'm blasted. Love you, though. Remember that.\" The natives seem a little concerned again. \n\nThe alien man goes from concerned to excited. \"But of course! Let us make merry! My friends, family, we have found freedom!\" \n\nAs the group drinks and has fun, probably with a pop song playing in the background, we rise to the stars and blast toward a fucking massive Klingon-looking ship. We see Shaka. He's a mean motherfucker who looks like a giant cracked-out koala. He clenches his fist, garnished in extravagant jewelry. The stones are the mini galaxies from the first movie. \n\n#\"The Men in Black are all that stands before me and my control over all galactic trade.
