He noted he was unclear if Walter White would appear in the sequel but said he would \"absolutely\" appear in the movie if Gilligan were to ask him.\n\n>\"It's a great story and there are a lot of people who felt that they wanted to see some kind of completion to some of these storylines that were left open [in the series finale],\" Cranston said. \"This idea, from what I'm told, gets into those \u2014 **at least a couple of the character show were not completed, as far as their journey.**\"\n\n-\n\noff the top of my head, characters whose journeys were \"incomplete\" at the end of Breaking Bad:\n\n-\n\nMain Characters:\n\n* Skyler White: living in a small apartment, raising Walt Jr. & Holly alone; working low-end job. estranged relationship with sister Marie. With Walt & the Neo-Nazis dead, she no longer needs to live in fear of them; but she still hasn't faced the full consequences of money laundering for Walt or her cover-up of Ted Beneke's financial crimes (including hiring Huell/Kuby to pay the taxes back which left Ted seriously injured). She is one of the few characters that still is in ABQ and has significant knowledge of Jesse.\n\n* Marie Schrader: Hank's widow and has an estranged relationship with sister Skyler. Knows Jesse from when he was working with Hank & Gomie. I doubt her kleptomania comes back as a plot point, but how her character deals with the loss of Hank is an open book.\n\n* Walt Jr: should be receiving millions from the Gray Matter \"charity\" soon, has never met Jesse. \n\n* Jimmy McGill aka \"Saul Goodman\": managing a Cinnabon in Ohama, NB, as seen in \"Better Call Saul\". I don't really see his story being touched on for the movie - plenty to cover on his show.\n\n-\n\nSupporting Characters:\n\n* Skinny Pete / Badger: Most likely contacts for Jesse\n\n* Huell: still sitting on bed?\n\n* Brock: Andrea's son and was the neo-nazi's leverage over Jesse to get him to continue to cook meth. Likely living with Andrea's mom after Andrea's murder. Almost certain to play some sort of role in Jesse's future - he'll want to ensure that he's safe.\n\n* Jesse Parents & Kid Brother: Jesse's relationship with his parents wasn't touched on again after he bought the house from them, so does that relationship stay severed? Jesse did cover for his younger brother's marijuana usage before getting kicked out from the house in S1\n\n* Wendy: probably still the same meth-addicted prostitute\n\n* Francesca: Saul's assistant. as seen in Better Call Saul's flash-foward scene, she stayed in ABQ after Saul fled (and helped destroy evidence), and had some unknown pre-arranged phone call to him. \n\n* Kaylee Ehrmantraut: Mike's granddaughter, likely still living in ABQ with her mom after Mike's death. \n\n-\n\nIf I had to guess what the general plot of the movie would be:\n\n* After escaping the Neo-Nazi compound, Jesse Pinkman wants to start a new life, but has unfinished business in ABQ - namely ensuring that the children harmed by the events of BB are taken care of - especially Brock.\n* With the police finding Walt's body (and recent sightings of him around town), known associates of Walt & Jesse are put under police protection/surveillance, limiting Jesse's options for help (like Skinny Pete, Badger, Wendy, and his estranged family).\n* Jesse turns to an unlikely ally - Marie Schrader, who wants the full story/closure in regards to what happened to Hank. (remember, as far as she knows Walt killed Hank, but Hank/Gomie's bodies should be exhumed soon since Walt gave Skyler the coordinates to trade in). Jesse tells her the actual story, which opens the door for her to reconcile with Skyler.\n\n... and I have no idea where the story could go from there. I think both Jesse and Skyler want to move on and start a new life, but since they could incriminate each other there's going to be a sort of prisoner's dilemma conflict between them. If they enter a reluctant partnership, perhaps Jesse & Walt Jr. meet for the first time and discuss their drastic different relationship with their father figure, Walt. \n", "created_utc": 1550091683.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "eger8fa", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_aq90sx", "parent_id": "t3_aq90sx", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/aq90sx/breaking_bad_movie_is_a_sequel_starring_aaron/eger8fa/", "score": 16, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Ray3142", "author_id": "5kyal", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Will Air?
