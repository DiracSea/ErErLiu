[Warning: Long post on the movement in film and pop culture called New Sincerity, which Kingsman is, and Austin Powers is the antithesis. It's about zero tongue in cheek or cynicism, about guilty pleasures being just pleasures, and in Kingsman, it's about being a sincere love letter instead of a parody or satire or send up.]\n\nI'd say the movie was the classic \"love letter to [insert genre] films.\"\n\nGalaxy Quest is closer to a satirical love letter than Kingsman, what with the \"why would anyone even build this, why does it even exist?\" when Sigourney Weaver is referencing the part of the spaceship that looks like an NES side-scroller obstacle course. \n\nKingsman didn't really have those types of parts. The tongue was never firmly planted in cheek, which makes it more of a pure love letter, a truly romantic love letter with no meta-levity really other than some mentions like \"I always wanted to be the hero\" and \"a spy film is only as good as the villain\" and \"this ain't that type of movie, bruv.\"\n\nBut that wasn't really pointing fun at spy films, just acknowledging it. \n\n* New Sincerity\n\nI'd say it's closer to the [*New Sincerity*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Sincerity) \"movement\" (that moves at a glacial pace) -- **literally described as post-postmodernism** -- that goes against what Daniel Craig has famously said about how Austin Powers has rendered spy films impossible to do it the old school ridiculous style. Austin Powers would be the polar opposite of New Sincerity, as it's rife with tongue in cheek jokes, explanations of tropes and common plot holes, etc. \n\nThere's no cynicism or irony in Kingsman; it's like a refined Connery film updated for today, and we are meant to love every minute of it unironically. The film is absurd but feels sincere. Wanted is an absurd film that knows it's absurd. \n\n* Marvel vs DC examples\n\n\"New Sincerity\" is tough to pin down.\n\nBut I'd say Marvel films are closer to that movement than D.C. Films. \n\nDC is more postmodern treatments of classic superheroes, bringing the \"Age of Heroes\" to the modern world, like giving Superman too much sci-fi and alien lore behind him; IMO he needs to be treated like Thor the character, some sci-fi but a hell of a lot of \"he's a god\" and superhero, that's it. \n\n\nEven Spider-Man films show differences. \n\nRaimi's Spiderman was closer to modernism/classical film. Webb's was postmodern Spidey. Now we are going back to his roots or arguably post-postmodernism. He lives in a world where no one really talks about the alien attacks anymore. He's totally sincere about being Spider-man, to a fault according to Tony. Garfield's version was a postmodern take. He never really took it seriously; Parker/Spidey is always quippy but he takes his job responsibly and seriously -- hence the whole \"with great power...\" Webb's films were too afraid to dive right into his most iconic line, while Cap 3 had no problem paraphrasing the iconic \"No, you move\" speech.\n\nMarvel films, especially Cap 1-3 and Iron Man 1 and Guardians, are all sincere stories with quips and heart. Stories that wanted to be told. Post postmodern, sincere takes with little cynicism. Cap is all earnest.\n\nWhere Marvel has gotten in trouble is when Whedon tries the postmodern flair of Buffy-esque quippy dialogue and scenes that are almost self-aware and absurd, like Tony and Cap chopping months of fire wood for a mother and 2 children just to put in an obvious sight gag...and it's not even winter or fall. Hell it may have been Summer 2015. The Thor films suffer from too much fish out of water scenes and humor, but not humor in general, and is too 90s humor. \n\nDoctor Strange really shouldn't work on film today, especially with Cumberbatch since he has always played the smartest man in the world. The ONLY way they could have pulled it off was by going head on with the Cumberbatch who pulls of troubled geniuses and doing it sincerely, instead of like Green Lantern type of treatment. \n\nThat's the problem with WB/DC IMO. They made Aquaman into this badass that looks nothing like most iterations, and I get the feeling they are really, really trying to gaslight everyone into believing Super Friends never existed especially Arthur Curry and his fish telepathy (its right in the comic con teaser -- \"I hear you can talk to fish,\" which I'd bet dollars to doughnuts it either gets cut or Curry flatly denies it by saying something like myths take on lives of their own, they turned Flash into more Peter Parker than Barry Allen (obviously going off of very small amount of footage, but literally every single line from Barry other than \"so you're Batman?\" has been a quip).  \n\nMan of Steel's final trailer was...amazing. If the movie took that tone and chronology and \"pace,\" it would have been legendary. \n\nI really wanted to see that \"what if a boy dreamt of being something else?\" storyline. Cliche but could be good if done sincerely.  Not, \"I'm lonely and misunderstood, and an alien woe is me.\"\n\nNolan's Batman was a post-postmodernism; Schumacher was the postmodernism take, Burton closer to modernism in the first one), we have the post modern take on Batman now: guns on everything, killing as necessary or at will, branding and justifying it, a Bruce Wayne that doesn't even put up the facade well, as he's pretty much frank castle from Netflix in and out of the suit. \n\nPostmodern Batman isn't terrible, because he's closer to the animated series version which many still adore. But you can't do post modern Batman and post post modern Wonderwoman and cyborg. \n\n* Action Films\n\nOff with the Marvel/DC talk. John Wick is part of the New Sincerity phase in the post-postmodern way. If Pulp Fiction was postmodern, Wick is post-postmodern, absolutely. Pulp Fiction had its world building, with Mr Wolf and what not. But it had hilarious moments too, like \"my wife is going to kill me\" despite being a bad ass, or accidentally shooting Marvin with a no scope 180 headshot, or Travolta coming back from taking a shit to his death ( uzi I think?). Then there's the diner scene as if to say, yeah, this is a new phase. Action films were mostly 1 man vs the world, like Die Hard or Arnold films or Rambo -- sort of like the modern version of late 50s early 70s western for the 80-90s. \n\nPulp Fiction did post modern action well, and apparently everyone and their mother in film school and in the spec market wrote Pulp Fiction knock offs for half a decade. It's why there aren't many good action flicks from the late 90s to about 2010 or beyond. \n\nNow we're watching Dredd (or appreciating it, as it was a sincere take on Dredd), John Wick, The Raid. Basically \"guilty pleasures\" that you shouldn't feel guilty about enjoying. Wick is absolutely Post-postmodern/modern, both ahead and retro of 80s/90s action in the one man takes all way, but post post modern in the world building, give the viewer credit way. \n\nLogline for John Wick: retired hitman's dog is killed and his car is stolen, and he seeks revenge. \n\nAnd it's totally sincere about it.   \n\n**The Fast and the Furious and Mission Impossible** franchises have benefited as well. \n\nOnce both went full sincere and bought into themselves they profited, instead of trying to be things that were a decade behind. \n\n* Comedy\n\n21 and 22 Jump Street luckily flipped its source material on its head and it was never cynical but more tongue in cheek, but it's hard to do New Sincerity comedy, but it nonetheless quit while it was ahead -- notice how they're not making anymore despite them making a ton of money.  \n\n The Hangover was straight up Post-postmodern. Real reactions to absurd situations. Real consequences. There weren't many quips. It was mostly serious reactions to ridiculous stuff. Zach G did come up with some one liners, but they weren't really the money-makers, as the trailers were the buzz, and there weren't jokes but realistic and sincere reactions to comedic situations). \n\nNow, it's Bob's Burgers and Rick and Morty and Bojack Horseman. All different genres, but they really examine the human condition sincerely. Bob's Burgers is freshly devoid of irony and cynicism. Rick and Morty was pitched as a satire or parody of BTTF,  but it's not that at all. Bojack is a comedy that fills me with existential dread and hits close to home, even if I've never lived where it's hitting. \n\nScott Pilgrim is a film made too early. It would fare better today. 2010 was still the cynical stage. Scott Pilgrim is intentionally campy and sincere about it. There's a genuine sweetness to the film. \n\nJuno was the height of the post 9/11 sarcastic cynical postmodern (I mean, a comedy of a pregnant 16 year old who unwittingly convinces a married man to divorce his wife -- everybody sucks!) comedy, arguably why Diablo Cody hasn't fared as well since. \n\nI love 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up, Superbad, Pineapple Express, Tropic Thunder, Wedding Crashers....but they're comedies of a bygone postmodern era. None of these premises are real, except maybe Superbad. \n\nThe Other Guys is post postmodern Will Ferrell, and ahead of its time, good script, setups, light improv, good pace and sincere laughs. !\" literally 90 minutes later.\n\n* Nostalgia\n\n**People are tired of the post 9/11 cynicism**. It's why nostalgia is as in high demand as ever. All this 80s and 90s stuff like Stranger Things, IT, Power Rangers, new Star Wars stories, Jurassic World, Disney live action remakes, with BatB being enormous. \n\nI can't believe how many movies are now TV shows. I've lost count. Even fucking Westworld counts! Nostalgia is always in, but now more than ever it seems. I think 9/11 blew a hole in everyone's memory for 7-8 years. \n", "created_utc": 1490889055.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1490901042.0, "id": "dflx7qy", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_62dsxs", "parent_id": "t1_dfltukk", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/62dsxs/kingsman_the_golden_circle_official_poster/dflx7qy/", "score": 173, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Death_Star_", "author_id": "box44", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Kingsmen also ends up being more of a satire than a parody \u2014\u00a0it's critical, not just humorous.

The tongue was never firmly planted in cheek, which makes it more of a pure love letter, a truly romantic love letter with no meta-levity really other than some mentions like \"I always wanted to be the hero\" and \"a spy film is only as good as the villain\" and \"this ain't that type of movie, bruv.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> But that wasn't really pointing fun at spy films, just acknowledging it. \n\nFirst of all, great comment. But aren't you underplaying those themes in Kingsmen? What about the scene in which two characters discuss why they like old Bond movies? What about the constant theme of trying to become Bond-esque - the lectures about being a gentlemen or his desire to spend time with this Swedish girl.\n\nI guess you would call it sincere, but for me this is mostly referential (which is typical for post-modern, isn't it?). Sure, for Space Quest the Star Trek references are also very obvious.\n\nWhat would you call a movie which actually tries to be like a classic Bond film, without mentioning Bond films? The Men from U.N.C.L.E. embodies this for me - and maybe I am just commenting here because I am sad that one is not getting a sequel. I am fully aware that it is a remake/TV show prequel/whatever.\n\nSo basically I am wondering: Why talk about Poltergeist in Stranger Things, why use Ghostbusters costumes? Why talk about old Bond movies in Kingsmen? \n\nThis points to one question: Why is new sincerity carrying the post-modern baggage of references? Is this what makes it truly post-post-modern?\n\nReddit eats it up, and I used to love references myself, but I grew tired of them, possibly because stuff like Community over-saturates one with it.\n\nWhy is it so rare that new movies in \"old genres\" are truly sincere - well-deserved in the collection of the director's favorite genre - yet something that can stand on its own. Indiana Jones is a great example for this, as it mimics the style of boy's magazines [http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/indiana-jones-and-the-last-crusade-1989] yet no character in it says \"Boy, I sure miss these old adventure stories\".", "created_utc": 1490910659.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1490913239.0, "id": "dfmhgpp", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_62dsxs", "parent_id": "t1_dflx7qy", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/62dsxs/kingsman_the_golden_circle_official_poster/dfmhgpp/", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "free_napalm", "author_id": "825ja", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "One comment:\n\n>  it's like a refined Connery film updated for today\n\nKingsman is almost certainly playing in the world of Roger Moore's Bond over Connery's.
