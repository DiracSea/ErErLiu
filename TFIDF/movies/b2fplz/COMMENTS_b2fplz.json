They had some tough lessons from the 2003 Hulk that they had to learn from, and even though the Norton reboot was good, they still decided to semi-reboot the character once again. That being said, they really hit a home run in so many aspects of the Ironman movie, including casting, marketing and look, that it almost redefined how superhero movies had to be made. \n\nAnd while I don't think a single person expected the truly massive mainstream success that MCU later became, it was not like superhero movies had been unable to gain widespread success before, after all the Nolan Batman, and first two Raimi Spiderman and Singer X-Men movies were all both rather well received and profitable. \n\nBut the Marvel success just completely blasts away any and all competition. Just to put it into perspective how successful, depending on how you calculate it, the MCU box office can now be said to outrank the *combined* box office of all Star Wars, Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings movies! Even if you start accounting for inflation and movie going habits over the years, it still easily beats the James Bond franchise, and that's a franchise with a similar amount of movies as the MCU and is arguably a cultural icon that spands generations! And all of that has happened in just over a decade!\n\nAnd while it has been a fun ride, I'm not sure this kind of dominance is that good a thing for the industry; much like WoW has both defined and strangled the MMO-genre of games, the success of MCU has pretty much defined the genre to the point that any competing franchise has a hard choice: either completely emulate the model and be accused of being boring copycat movies, or take huge chances that might fail. It obviously doesn't help that the DCEU appears to have been coordinated with the skill and preparation of a flock of headless chickens, but it's not like they had a small task ahead of them when they started. \n\nEDIT: Many, many posters below have commented that the 2003 Hulk movie weren't MCU. It might not have been an official starting shot of the MCU, but they clearly analysed and learned from that movie (Just as they would have learned from a lot of other failed superhero movies at the time, like Fantastic 4 or Green Lantern). Also, around 2008, the MCU wasn't really an established \"thing\" yet in the public consciousness, and they could have easily mixed and matched among what they found to be working. If the 2003 Hulk movie had been a success, I'm more than sure that they would have included it in the MCU Canon.\n\nSo I still find it fair to say that they learned a lot from the movie and adapted from its failure, not to mention that calling a movie in a new universe with the same character can still be called a \"reboot\".\n\nAlso, this post has received a lot more replies that I'm generally used to and it would be pointless to try to respond to all of them, so I'll just point out that many people below have made a lot of interesting inputs and good points.", "created_utc": 1552908191.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1552920272.0, "id": "eismf2q", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_b2fplz", "parent_id": "t1_eishgr3", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/b2fplz/suicide_squad_sequel_is_a_total_reboot_not_called/eismf2q/", "score": 1605, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "kaaz54", "author_id": "bhl5t", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "[deleted]", "created_utc": 1552902732.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1553124671.0, "id": "eisiqtx", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_b2fplz", "parent_id": "t1_eishgr3", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/b2fplz/suicide_squad_sequel_is_a_total_reboot_not_called/eisiqtx/", "score": 2823, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Hell, i know MoS is loved by most people here on reddit, but imo it wasn't the best film to start a franchise off of.", "created_utc": 1552902044.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "eisicld", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_b2fplz", "parent_id": "t1_eishgr3", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/b2fplz/suicide_squad_sequel_is_a_total_reboot_not_called/eisicld/", "score": 194, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I mean not all of phase one was fantastic (remember how the actor for Hulk changed after one movie?

So they cut out basically all of his scenes cause most of them were one on one with Margot Robbie. So you mix Jared Leto, Margot Robbie (who\u2019s an absolutely fearless actress, she got the job for The Wolf of Wall Street because during an audition with DiCaprio, she got so heated during an argument scene that she slapped him and DiCaprio and Scorsese loved it) and David Ayer who feeds into actors to get deeper and deeper into the role (like how he egged on Shia LeBeouf to cut his face up and to pull a tooth out) and they had what WB deemed as unusable footage. \n\nBut like this scene:\n\nhttps://tenor.com/view/joker-suicide-squad-bye-bomb-jared-leto-gif-5759300\n\nHe looks great there and could easily pull off the Batman Death of the Family/Batman Endgame comic story arc. \n\nOr even this from the cinematographer of Suicide Squad\u2019s instagram:\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BWlQzuFl2hl/?hl=en\n\nHe had the potential but WB backstabbed him because he acted out what the script said. His entire crux of the Joker in the original screenplay was he was an abusive boyfriend to Harley looking at her like a possession but then they cut 90% of his scenes, relegated him to mostly flashbacks (when the original screenplay was nearly 100% chronological) and instead changed his character in the edit to being extremely loving and obsessed with Harley Quinn. So of course his character wouldn\u2019t make work! \n\nA lot of people have hobbies. One of mine is reading and looking up every scrap of information on what went wrong with Suicide Squad behind the scenes.

A good, solid Justice League movie would have been insanely profitable right out of the gate because of the already existent cultural knowledge of the team; barring that, a Trinity movie based on \"Trinity\" would have also been insanely profitable if they had actually *thought* for more than a second about how to do a Superman-Batman-Wonder Woman team-up movie besides mashing together 4 separate storylines into one movie and then also trying to set up for Justice League in the same movie. Everyone knows the Batman and Superman stories, and now we have a semi-solid base for the Wonder Woman mythos. Just do a full reboot, start with a Trinity movie, and then do Justice League. \n\nMarvel had to do solos because no one knew who the hell their characters were outside of Spider-man and the X-Men. The immense cultural knowledge imbalance was what led to the Marvel's decision to do solo movies first. If WB stopped worrying so much about \"is it profitable\" and started worrying more about \"have we made a solid movie with good actors and a *good script* that makes sense,\" the money *will* follow. \n\nAll that being said, the 'the villain from each movie winds up in Suicide Squad' is a sweet idea, though I have no idea how you'd swing that with Green Lantern and Superman.

Iron man 1 wasn\u2019t some sort of super villain trying to destroy the world it was a playboy genius who got trapped in a cave and had an existential crisis and needed to discover himself to get out of it.\n\nMan of steel results in entire cities being levelled with a villain so powerful he really should\u2019ve been a stage 2 villain at least (Loki), and BvS was even worse in that it introduced a fight within the heroes (who we don\u2019t know very well yet so it lacks emotional weight like Civil war), and added a villain that really should\u2019ve been at least similar to Ultron insofar threat level.\n\nThey skipped so many steps and jumped to massive escalations before it needed to. Look at Black Panther, relatively late into the game Marvel adds a movie basically dedicated to individual struggle of a hero and his people, with only threat of weapons being shipped out to upset inequality but not eradicate mankind or something, they also had a relatable villain, something DC hasn\u2019t managed at all imo. \n\n", "created_utc": 1552912564.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "eisqbus", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_b2fplz", "parent_id": "t1_eismv1p", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/b2fplz/suicide_squad_sequel_is_a_total_reboot_not_called/eisqbus/", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Krillin113", "author_id": "i7lkg", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "> And this is Snyder's problem - he thinks that if he indicates something, it's enough for the story.
