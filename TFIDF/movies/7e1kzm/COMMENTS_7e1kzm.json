I like Nemo, its a good movie and I think MOST Pixar fans (certainly not all, everyones different) would probably agree they've only made 1 truly bad movie...but I've always found Nemo to be overrated. It's honestly in the bottom half of my personal Pixar list.\n\nBut I know i'm in the minority there and still respect everyone elses opinions, and it's certainly a fine movie regardless.\n\nIt's funny how, Cars 2 aside, it seems impossible to truly insult a Pixar movie when saying a certain one is not your favorite.
