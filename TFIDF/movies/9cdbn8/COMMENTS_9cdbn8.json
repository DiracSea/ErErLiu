Violet didn't though, which is why it was her arc that got focus this time around.\n\n2) I completely disagree the villain was bad. The Screenslaver was genuinely scary as a fake ruse villain and, although the reveal was not surprising, it wasn't really meant to be. Evelyn was probably one of the most nuanced and interesting sympathetic villain-but-not-really-villains Pixar or Disney have written in a long while. There are so many layers to her as an actual person, and her being revealed to be acting out of a sense of directionless unresolved grief and misplaced anger over any real megomania was genius I thought.\n\nIt gave her the opportunity for some really complex head-butting with Helen that elevated it above the usual punchy-fighty, as it became clear the two women did both like each-other, but couldn't except each other's viewpoint. I LOVE narratives where both the villain and the hero can be seen as correct, and Incredibles 2 did it as flawlessly as I've seen any animated movie do it. \n\n3) We have no idea how the public perceives superheroes at that point.

The same thing the second one is about. The themes that run not only through the Parr family's struggle this time, but also the villain.**\n\nBoth of the Deavor sibling's entire motivations stem from their deep love for their parents and neither of them having got over losing them. Evelyn grows bitter and sees supers as responsible for her family being torn apart, Winston becomes more childishly enamored with them because he associates his feelings of nostalgia with his parents still being alive. The conflicting actions of both set the plot into motion and turn the tables on supers being illegal.

If you only looked at the most critically acclaimed batman comics and based your adaption on them you'd get a very dark and very violent batman, which is precisely the skewed interpretation they went for.\n\nFinally, some things always have to change and the source material isn't always infalliable.

It's as if their power defines them, and they are useless without. MCU seems to have gone another direction; Most of the characters are relate-able; you understand Cap's desire to help everyone, Stark's feeling of shame for what he has done with all the weapons, Thor's (eventual) realization of him being a protector, Quill's just a kid that lost his parents and stuck with a bunch of thieves, and Peter Parker is just a kid that really wants to help make his neighbourhood a better place. These are all qualities that make them human.\n\nNolan's Batman made it look real because Nolan gave us the time to understand Bruce's struggle and the conviction to become the dark knight, BvS just throws you in the middle of the conflict and no real build up those those character. If you tell me BvS is the culmination of Man of Steel and the Dark knight series, then BvS is bullshit in that regards; it's not bad, but it has no coherent context.

It doesn't help that they are a product of a generation where irony and deconstructions are themselves in vogue. \n\nThe mcu deconstructs by being more self aware, leaning into goofyness and campyness in a tongue and cheek way, subverting tropes and letting it just be fun in opposition to the way that movies like the raimi spiderman movies or the X-men movies never did. Those movies always held on to a kernel of seriousness a bit too tightly, while still having goofy outfits and plots in a way that came off as campy to general audiences.  \n\nOne of the big signature moves of the MCU is that *everything* is funny, to the point that it has become a criticism. Examples are [The dance off in guardians, the gag with thor spinning around during the exposition speech in the beginning of ragnarok, 'puny god' in the first avengers movie, etc.](#spoiler) this kind of funniness keeps it from feeling as campy as early superhero movies did, but also prevents the movies from being able to really dig into emotions or anything serious for too long because they are scared that it will turn people off.\n\nThe successful DC movies (mostly just the nolan batman movies) succeed by being a deconstruction in the opposite direction, removing as much campiness as possible and telling a story about superheros while using as few genre conventions as possible, no colorful outfits, no fun at all. trying to sell superheros to people who are too cynical for them.\n\n\nBoth extremes exist as a way for creators to point out that they are aware of the cynicism that general audiences have for traditional superhero media, and as an attempt to distance themselves from convention either by mocking it with goofy self-awareness or by shunning it altogether.\n\nI think the real deconstruction to come is when someone can do a straight up superhero movie, without every scene being a goofy self-aware quip afraid to engage in real emotions, and without being a ***GRITTY***^TM genre filp, but facing the cynicism straight on, and actually making a solid film that stands up to it.
