Most of the cast were chosen because they're black and there's nothing wrong with that because being black is an important and relevant part of the characters. As for Ryan Coogler, he's a great director and whether he was chosen because he's black is debatable, but either way, him approaching the material in a very personal way seems to be a part of why he was.
