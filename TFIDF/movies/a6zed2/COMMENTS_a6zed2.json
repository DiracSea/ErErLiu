I first saw this film years ago when I was living in Korea, with an Indonesian girl I was dating at the time who also hadn't seen it. I liked it, but I could tell right away something was different about it compared to western style children's films. This review sums it up so wonderfully, it's exactly what I was thinking at the time without being able to say it, especially the fact that for once, the adults weren't the evil or stupid ones. If this were an American film, the father \"would hear none of this Totoro business, now do your chores!\"\n\nMy niece is four, and obsessed with Totoro. I showed it to her last year, and now she only wants to watch it when I'm around. I bought her a totoro pajama suit last year for Christmas, and my sister sent me a picture of her wearing it to school the other day. As the years go by, I'm connecting with this film a little more.
