It's in the Lower East Side.\n- I know eateries aren't on your list but I would suggest trying a hidden or late night menu. Takashi in the West Village does a crazy good beef ramen after midnight on the weekends for example.\n- A museum that never gets enough love is The Cloisters. It's part of the Met system but since it's at like 208th street, it's not nearly as popular as the Met. It's on a hill on the northern most part of Manhattan. Rockefeller bought all the art in, and the monastery the art is housed in, AND the view across the river in NJ so it would remain pristine. It's gorgeous and I hate museums. \n- There's a Japanese restaurant called JeBon on St. Marks that houses a show called Batsu! The food is garbage but Batsu is a live action Japanese game show with pretty decent improv actors performing. It's great but not for the faint of heart. Batsu means \"punishment\" in Japanese. The performers play games and instead of crowning a winner, the loser has to perform something terrible. Like playing a DJ turntable that's covered in mouse traps or eating sushi off a hairy man without chopsticks. It's hilarious.\n- Another fun performance thing is Drunk Shakespeare. A cast of actors perform a Shakespearean play (it's usually MacBeth) but one of them takes six shots of whiskey first. And then they improvise everything. It's a great time. \n- Depending on when you go, Smorgasburg might be up. It's an outdoor food festival that starts in the Spring into the Fall. Every Saturday, it's in the park right by the water in Williamsburg in Brooklyn. It's not cheap but 40-60 vendors with all sorts of food. Amazing.\n- Also, if the weather is nice, they play outdoor movies in Brooklyn Bridge Park. Pack a picnic and a bottle of wine, watch a movie for free outdoors. \n There's usually SOMETHING going on every weekend. There's plenty of fun stuff to do!

So much hype at the theater because these things weren't released on talk shows beforehand or even mentioned in entertainment news (even if they were, good luck trying to watch it online with slow internet and no youtube/vimeo/etc. Which reminds me, if you wanted to watch a trailer, you'd have to watch a movie or happen to catch a 30-second ad on TV, you definitely couldn't just type \"Spider-man trailer\" and see the video...back then, the best you could hope for is searching for it on Google and there being a random website hosting a bootleg shot of the trailer, or maybe off of Limewire, and waiting like an hour or two for it to download in like 144p or whatever) -- so you'd see the trailer for the first time at theaters. \n\nObviously, I only got to see this trailer once, then 9/11 happened and it was removed and I never saw it again... until about 10 years later on YouTube.\n\nImagine you're watching a random movie and kinda heard about a Spider-Man film being made...and then slowly you start to realize what MIGHT be happening, and then you see the webbing, and the audience went crazy, and the theater was like half-full (back then, you had to really care about particular films and look up their news to see their production and release dates; otherwise, you knew nothing, since there wouldn't be a Variety or Hollywood Reporter to talk about this stuff).\n\nImagine that happening today. You're watching Guardians of the Galaxy, then you see a trailer for something like Avatar 2, and not a teaser or anything, but a full-on trailer, and it's announced to suddenly be released December 2017; or you see footage of a Fantastic 4 film remake....that's actually just an intro to their characters, as they're actually just the beginning of a full-length Infinity Wars trailer, and Iron Man and Cap and the Guardians are battling alongside a proper Fantastic 4 team, with Doctor Doom fighting with the good guys against Thanos.", "created_utc": 1490403725.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1490404291.0, "id": "dfdjb8y", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_61ak4z", "parent_id": "t1_dfdcxh5", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/61ak4z/spiderman_homecoming_official_poster/dfdjb8y/", "score": 11, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Death_Star_", "author_id": "box44", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "u a wavy dude", "created_utc": 1490417026.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dfdry9w", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_61ak4z", "parent_id": "t1_dfdc2u6", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/61ak4z/spiderman_homecoming_official_poster/dfdry9w/", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "cheezymau5", "author_id": "663at", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "S C A R Y", "created_utc": 1490413877.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dfdq13v", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_61ak4z", "parent_id": "t1_dfdc2u6", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/61ak4z/spiderman_homecoming_official_poster/dfdq13v/", "score": 6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "jbrar44", "author_id": "11o4bd", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "These Pym particles.
