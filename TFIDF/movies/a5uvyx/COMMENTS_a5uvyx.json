They use screenshots, obviously, but also CCTV footage, livestreams, skype/facetime calls.\n\nBut beyond that, thematically, the movie presented technology in a very balanced view. It was powerful, consequential, integral to life, dangerous, functional, and astounding all at once. Sometimes technology brought resources together faster than ever before and yielded great results for the investigation. Sometimes their reliance upon technology weakened their investigation. People used it to rally around the lost girl and try to come together emotionally, as a community. And other times, strangers made wild claims that wasted time, effort, and emotions. \n\nIt may not have been the most positive or negative view of technology, but rather the most complete. The challenges the internet presents. The feats it already overcomes.\n\nOn top of that, solid acting and writing made it a great movie. Very underappreciated. It didn't quite find an audience in theatres. Which is understandable given the current state of blockbusters being the most consistently financially successful. I imagine most people consider this a \"tv movie\", and they're not entirely wrong.", "created_utc": 1544731069.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "ebpwahj", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_a5uvyx", "parent_id": "t1_ebpe56p", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/a5uvyx/new_poster_for_jordan_peeles_us/ebpwahj/", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "boundbythecurve", "author_id": "7u2qm", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "[deleted]", "created_utc": 1544724357.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1544729949.0, "id": "ebpn33x", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_a5uvyx", "parent_id": "t1_ebpe56p", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/a5uvyx/new_poster_for_jordan_peeles_us/ebpn33x/", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I'm just happy to see the dude putting the pussy on the chainwax", "created_utc": 1544745523.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "ebqev69", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_a5uvyx", "parent_id": "t1_ebpy7nt", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/a5uvyx/new_poster_for_jordan_peeles_us/ebqev69/", "score": 175, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "SLAP ASS", "created_utc": 1544734853.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "ebq1it3", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_a5uvyx", "parent_id": "t1_ebpy7nt", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/a5uvyx/new_poster_for_jordan_peeles_us/ebq1it3/", "score": 236, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Reddit in 2050\n\n\u201cTIL Jordan Peele was already an famous comedy actor when he directed his first movie \u2018Get Out\u2019 in 2017\u201d", "created_utc": 1544767950.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "ebr3rmg", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_a5uvyx", "parent_id": "t1_ebpy7nt", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/a5uvyx/new_poster_for_jordan_peeles_us/ebr3rmg/", "score": 27, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Arielrbr", "author_id": "bazla", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "And MadTV!

Similarly, several years ago, we passed on playing Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy because word of mouth said it was too difficult to follow.\n\nFinally, the recent Nutcracker movie (terrible reviews) is actually doing fairly well for him because it's a film that parents can bring their kids to, he's charging $4 a ticket, and it's the HOLIDAYS.
