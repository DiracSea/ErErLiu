It's broken up into three distinct parts. The Launchie arc, the arc where Ender was a soldier, and the arc where Ender was a commander. All three arcs are self-contained stories with a beginning, a middle and an end as well. So I used that book as an example in franchising books. That ONE book could have been THREE 90 minute films. Easily. They could have kept the unnecessary CGI to fill the seats with people that only go see movies if they're special effects nightmare scapes, they would have had far more time to develop characters and plot and throw in fan service, and it would have been easily made into a trilogy to make the studio hella cash money.\n\nI'm so tired of seeing my favorite childhood media turned into trash. The Golden Compass could have been done in a similar way as well.
