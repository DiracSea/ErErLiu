The book destroys the hotel but maintains Jack's heroism (despite King clearly painting him as a recovering alcoholic/abuser), but in Doctor Sleep, Dan returns to the hotel and has some closure, which I always felt was out of place, considering the ashes that both the hotel and Jack's relationship with his family were left in. In the film, Jack is killed as his insanity takes hold but in a much slower way, and the hotel (a symbol of madness and literal haven for evil) remains, which is far more cynical, sure, but in my opinion far more poignant and memorable. Danny never got to see his father redeemed in any way, which would lead to the much more scarred and hopeless adult that King depicts in Doctor Sleep.", "created_utc": 1560449650.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "er2tt9b", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_c069d8", "parent_id": "t1_er2j1m2", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/c069d8/first_poster_for_doctor_sleep/er2tt9b/", "score": 6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "HeronSun", "author_id": "77fvq", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "In the book it mentions the incident where he broke his sons arm that led to his quitting drinking.", "created_utc": 1560444902.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "er2iox1", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_c069d8", "parent_id": "t1_er2ha3o", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/c069d8/first_poster_for_doctor_sleep/er2iox1/", "score": 58, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Diogenes-of-Synapse", "author_id": "kxnf4", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "yeah it's a different story with the same premise, family goes to a hotel to caretake for winter. the book is about Jack's struggles with alcoholism, guilt, family and the hotel's influence, some of which would probably be pretty important to King. the movie is mostly about isolation and doesn't really touch on alcoholism, which kinda makes the bar scene pointless.", "created_utc": 1560447123.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "er2on1f", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_c069d8", "parent_id": "t1_er2j9pu", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/c069d8/first_poster_for_doctor_sleep/er2on1f/", "score": 11, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "oPLABleC", "author_id": "qmwk6", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "\u201cPretty good\u201d\n\nCome on man, it deserves a little bit more recognition than that", "created_utc": 1560448011.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "er2qaf2", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_c069d8", "parent_id": "t1_er2j9pu", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/c069d8/first_poster_for_doctor_sleep/er2qaf2/", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "spinmyspaceship", "author_id": "ws1fd", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "It was kinda lame and random.
