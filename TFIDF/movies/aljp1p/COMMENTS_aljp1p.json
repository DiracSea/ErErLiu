I'm not saying starting with an older, jaded Batman was a bad idea, I actually really like that, but Batman killing? The fact that they didn't show what lead up to that just makes it feel like the writing was done by someone who doesn't understand the character very well, and just wanted an action movie with a lot of death and a lot going on.

They didn't understand that you could have a Batman who was truer to the comics counterpart whilst also having him be dark and angry and shit. \n\nLike, Snyder used TKDR as a basis but Batman doesn't actually kill anyone in that book. Other characters make reference to Batman never killing anyone at multiple points. There's even a mini arc that he goes through in book 3 I believe where he himself has an internal monologue about him wanting to kill *for the first time* when the joker comes back, but in the end he fails to sink to his level and kill. The joker even makes fun of him for not going far enough and kills himself to frame Batman (\"I am really...very disappointed with you, my sweet\"). And that becomes the only murder that the cops blame Batman for. Nobody else. Despite him not actually doing it. If Batman had killed anyone else in the book, they'd have charged him as such or mentioned it but they don't. People mention the scene where he supposedly shoots somebody, but not only is there not an open gunshot wound on this person, but the 'splat' on the wall isnt even blood colored (it's solid grey) and even if it was blood it would be from the other mutant who was gunned down by his friend. And again nobody, not the cops, nor the *detractors* of Batman in the news segments as well as Batman himself, acknowledge that's he's killed anybody even **after** this scene takes place. He is always treated as a character who doesn't kill *until* he is framed for a murder he didn't commit. That should tell you something about the validity (or lack thereof) of the arguments that say he kills in TDKR. \n\nYet Snyder thought he kills people all the time in the book for whatever reason.

The idea of creating a continuity is amazing, and Avengers revolutionized the movie industry in a huge way. But they didn't go right for it. They made Iron Man, and the reason they got to do Avengers was because Iron Man was simply a great stand-alone movie. Fantastic acting, great plot-line, a hero that most casual fans of super-hero movies didn't know well but instantly fell in love with. And the most important part? Allowing for the possibility of more stories, but not making your own story fall short on the pretense that it will feel complete when the next one comes out. They introduced all six Avengers, and even the villain, before Avengers came out, so it wasn't just Iron Man suddenly making friends with a 100 year old dude and a god that we've never seen before now. That pacing and world building is what made Avengers great. \n\nAnd then they kept going. Iron Man got more stories, Captain America got a LOT more development, and Thor/Loki went through a lot as well. Not only did the heroes change, but the world around them did too and we got to see that happen. AoU was a massive turning point for the heroes, which lead into Civil War. Civil war was a fantastic fucking movie, but it wouldn't have worked had we not already seen Steve and Tony develop a relationship over years. It wasn't a story of heroes fighting each other because \"wow, action, explosions, who would win?\" It was a very character driven story that earned it's payoff. \n\nAnd then infinity war. Also a fantastic movie. Absolutely wouldn't have worked if it had come earlier. What JL did was basically the equivalent of having Iron Man, then Civil War, then Infinity War with nothing else in between. That's why it failed, it didn't do anything to make us care. It treated it's story like a milktoast action movie designed to be a cash grab and well? That's all it was.

I think that's the the only real misstep i feel he made. Other than that it pretty much worked. He even added to the story by fixing dumb plot points like Rorschach having a fucking rough draft of his journal and a back up mask instead he just retrieves them during the riot. but either way at the end of the day he ended up just being lucky. \n\n\n He was just lucky enough that his first project happened to be something that meshed well with his style.
