He\u2019s been questioned about this and he acknowledges it but kinda shuts down further discussion by saying \u201cyeah I had an objectivist phase\u201d. However, those themes are all over The Incredibles and Ratatouille. In Hollywood you can\u2019t let people know you aren\u2019t drinking the leftist kool-aide without ramifications.\n\nA few things have changed since the first film released. One, Pixar was still a separate entity from Disney and they essentially had autonomy. There was no decision making by committee in the way Disney runs their operation. If Lassiter hired Bird to do a movie, it\u2019s because he trusted his vision. \n\nBird has said he\u2019d only do this movie if he had a real reason to tell the story. As has been pointed out, this movie - while very entertaining - didn\u2019t need to be made. I think you\u2019re right about the public demand and the obvious decision it would have been to the board at Disney. I think there\u2019s a good chance Bird went so long without making one was in part because the right idea for a script didn\u2019t come along and possibly in part because of the changing atmosphere at Disney and Hollywood/society at large. He may have known he wouldn\u2019t be able to hit the same thematic beats anymore with Disney calling the shots. Stuff like \u201cif everyone\u2019s super, nobody is super\u201d or \u201cwe keep finding new ways of celebrating mediocrity\u201d. Watching incredibles 2, it actually felt schizophrenic at times. The message of the movie seemed to be at odds with itself.

After lengthy discussions, they agreed to move ahead with a new reboot, although this time things would be different. Spider-Man: Homecoming is still financed and distributed by Sony Pictures (i.e. they pay for 100% of it), and Sony gets the box office, but Marvel Studios produced the film and served as the \u201ccreative lead.\u201d That means Feige and the Marvel Studios braintrust helped pick the director and cast, helped craft the film\u2019s tone and style, and made sure to bring something fresh and new to character that audiences are already very familiar with. In short, they made a Marvel Studios Spider-Man movie.\n\nSo what does Marvel Studios get in return out of this deal? Besides getting to play with a toy they\u2019ve been eyeing for a very long time now, they get to use Tom Holland\u2019s Peter Parker in a set number of MCU movies (five in total, per this initial agreement, including Homecoming and its sequel). That means that Spider-Man: Homecoming takes place within the same Marvel Cinematic Universe as Doctor Strange and Iron Man, and Holland\u2019s Peter Parker\u2014after making his debut in Captain America: Civil War\u2014is appearing alongside folks like Tony Stark and Black Widow in Avengers: Infinity War and the untitled Avengers 4.\n\nWhile Marvel Studios doesn\u2019t get any box office from Spider-Man: Homecoming and its sequel, they do still own the merchandising rights to Spider-Man and thus if Homecoming is a success, that\u2019ll no doubt extend to the toys, underoos, and other Spider-Man products available. Moreover, ensuring Spider-Man: Homecoming is a good movie helps the MCU brand\u2014if folks like this Peter Parker, they\u2019re going to want to see him in Infinity War and whatever other MCU movies he\u2019s in.\n\nThe current, complicated deal that was struck between Marvel, Sony, and Disney (which owns Marvel) is at present only for Spider-Man: Homecoming, its sequel, Civil War, and the two Avengers movies. If all goes well, they\u2019ll come back to the table and renegotiate to keep this going. Or it\u2019s possible that Sony says \u201cwe\u2019ll take it from here\u201d and Peter Parker disappears from the MCU altogether.\n\n\n\nEdit: Words", "created_utc": 1533074957.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e3dlk5h", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_93ftie", "parent_id": "t1_e3d90xv", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/93ftie/incredibles_2_hits_1_billion_at_box_office_faster/e3dlk5h/", "score": 464, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Cadal290", "author_id": "bfnx4xd", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Yes", "created_utc": 1533064919.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e3d9mdk", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_93ftie", "parent_id": "t1_e3d90xv", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/93ftie/incredibles_2_hits_1_billion_at_box_office_faster/e3d9mdk/", "score": 59, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Sunshine145", "author_id": "d976y", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Perfectly imbalanced ", "created_utc": 1533080151.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e3dr2b2", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_93ftie", "parent_id": "t1_e3dkwks", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/93ftie/incredibles_2_hits_1_billion_at_box_office_faster/e3dr2b2/", "score": 40, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "sweaty-pajamas", "author_id": "rv4ch", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "This is the tale of Captain Jack Sparrow   \nA pirate so brave on the seven seas (what?)   \nA mystical quest to the isle of Tokyo   \nRaven locks sway in the  Mustang's breeze", "created_utc": 1533079953.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e3dquns", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_93ftie", "parent_id": "t1_e3douvm", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/93ftie/incredibles_2_hits_1_billion_at_box_office_faster/e3dquns/", "score": 43, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Jonny_Tacos", "author_id": "an0qj", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Basically Jack will need to learn how to drift the Black Pearl with the help of Vin Diesel.

I'm more arguing that they aren't sustainable.\n\nAs in I doubt we're going to be seeing 20 Transformer movies...\n\nSix movies is an outstanding success for most franchises in most genres. But superhero movies have longer-term goals with their universes, and churning out bad movies isn't sufficient for that.\n\nThe MCU never would have made it to 20 movies if most people considered them bad. X-Men has been rocky, they needed a few soft reboots, but they'll make it to 13. The DCEU has already gotten to 5 movies, with only 1 that's been widely considered good. They may not make it past 8 if Aquaman and Shazam suck (although Wonder Woman seems pretty likely to get a full trilogy). Sony's Spider-Man universe fell apart after two movies.\n\nThe MCU changed the goalposts of what studios want to accomplish. Especially with superheroes, but it's not limited to that. They all want that 20+ run of success, but churning out shitty movies like the Mummy definitely isn't going to get them there.\n\nIt's more in that long-term outlook that I partially agree with the person you responded to.
