Give him a human enough face and a big build/masculine physique and all of a sudden you've got a misunderstood hunk with a soft side who really cares - and you notice you don't have a beast at all, you've got a lot of girls' ideal man. I say this having had a huge crush on beast growing up.\n\nIt's an extremely safe trope, and any social commentary it tries to make is lost on the fact that you're cheering for the beast in the first place and there's little to no internal conflict for the viewer. You can derive some social commentary from it if you stop to think about it and come up with a moral to the story, but it's quite contrived.\n\nIn order to get anything out of this trope, I honestly think there needs to be a real change of perspective. For example, seeing the whole thing from the perspective of the townsfolk who are terrified of the beast and really think it's done terrible things, and trying to generate the same fear in the viewer, then having him actually be hideous but still somehow show that he's not the real monster in the end.\n\nI think it's a lot harder to find 'sexy' things about beastliness for a woman, so maybe that would be more conducive for a fresh take on the trope, but honestly I don't think people would like that. I'd be fascinated by such a movie, really, but I'm not sure I'd even enjoy it. It'd be the sort of thing I'd be able to appreciate by stepping back and looking at the whole thing, but I honestly think it'd take a genius director to make that story appeal to people and not lose its focus. People like beauty - be it conventional or unconventional - and classic storylines. The trope exists in its state for a reason.\n\nNow I do want to say that the best exception to this I know of is Notre Dame de Paris (Not the disney version!), but holy shit is it heavy. It's an incredible story with a lot of meaning, but it's no fairy tale: [Quasimodo is beaten and tortured for things that are not his fault despite being genuine and sweet because of his beastly appearance and is used as a scapegoat for truly evil people. All the while, his impossible love never comes close to being requited and when his love is killed on behalf of the very same people who used him, he commits suicide.](#spoiler) The perspectives used in the book really give the reader a taste of the cruelty that is injustice based on prejudice.\n\nTL;DR - This trope is sugar coated to shit, and it takes a lot away from the incredible potential it has, because its true potential is way heavier and probably doesn't have a happy ending.", "created_utc": 1505406548.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dn01btm", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_702bw0", "parent_id": "t1_dmzvv9b", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/702bw0/new_poster_for_guillermo_del_toros_the_shape_of/dn01btm/", "score": 117, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "-Njala-", "author_id": "u6brh", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I still like this trope, but I'd love to see it reversed, too.", "created_utc": 1505403460.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dmzyczb", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_702bw0", "parent_id": "t1_dmzvv9b", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/702bw0/new_poster_for_guillermo_del_toros_the_shape_of/dmzyczb/", "score": 29, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Igotsoldshit", "author_id": "1vz0k01", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Splice is kinda like that?", "created_utc": 1505403787.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dmzyo2g", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_702bw0", "parent_id": "t1_dmzvv9b", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/702bw0/new_poster_for_guillermo_del_toros_the_shape_of/dmzyo2g/", "score": 27, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "desull", "author_id": "578c1", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "You should watch Spring.
