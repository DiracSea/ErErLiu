That whole spiel, \"It's not about getting there, but *being there*?\" That image of Mount Fuji? He didn't write that: McCloud wrote that. He flat out recited what McCloud did (even up to showing the great wave off Kanagawa) word for word. In any rigorous setting that'd be considered plagiarism. It's even more troublesome considering that Oshii has much less experience in manga panelling than his contemporaries, so it's hard to claim that this *is* what's happening. It also implies that comic sequencing is applicable to filmic language, when it's more likely that Oshii's focus on aspect-to-aspect is moreso pillow shots closer to folks like Ozu. Considering that Oshii grew up on cinema, that makes more sense than comics.\n\nThe second is a thesis removed from the aspect-to-aspect emphasis. Puschak argues that this emphasis on space is precisely what GITS pedestalizes, that we are bodies extended into a space and that space reveals its own anxieties.
