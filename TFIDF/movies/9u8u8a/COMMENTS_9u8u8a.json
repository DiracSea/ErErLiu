As we were walking around, we passed a movie theater that was playing Requiem, and this guy Jordan -- who was my closest friend that summer - said it was his favorite movie and suggested we all go in.  That's literally all I knew about Requiem before I saw it.\n\nTo set the stage, we were all ages 14-16.  I was the only girl in the group, and I was a VERY SHELTERED 16-year-old.  My parents weren't allowing me to see R-rated movies till I was 17, so I had seen exactly one R-rated movie -- Fear -- by total accident when I was 13, and that one had scared me so much that I had nightmares and was afraid of Mark Wahlburg for a LONG time after.\n\nAt the time, MY favorite movies were Charade and Hocus Pocus, so hearing a friend say something was his favorite movie conjured up the idea of a film that was fun and pleasant.  That is what I had in my head when walked in.\n\nSUCH a scarring experience.  It was like being hit by a train and then systematically flayed to the bone.  At some point in the middle of the movie, I suddenly came to and realized I was gripping the hands of both guys on either side of me and had tears just STREAMING down my face.  I didn't stop crying for a good 20 minutes afterwards.

Thanks mom.\n\nBy the time I was an adult I'd lost count of the number of times I'd watched live sex scenes acted out on stage, sometimes just a few feet away from us, while I sat next to my mother. Even though we were terribly religious growing up and my mother sobbed like crazy when they found my browser history that one time (IIRC \"it's like somebody broke into our house and raped you\").\n\nSooo sex scenes with my parents in the room no longer weird me out. There's a little switch in my mind that flips off like \"we're watching art now it doesn't count as weird\". Or at least, I no longer have the capacity to process the weirdness because if I did my psyche would snap like a twig.\n\nIs it any wonder that I grew up to be that person who works a conservative day job in tech making them coins and then gets up on stage and vomits glitter on stage in drag bars for fun on the weekends? I am the faggoty-ass monstrosity that happens when your mother is a professional actress and your father is a pastor.", "created_utc": 1541401768.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1541404592.0, "id": "e930xkn", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_9u8u8a", "parent_id": "t1_e92pd42", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/9u8u8a/natalie_portman_thought_black_swan_was_going_to/e930xkn/", "score": 9, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Quiet_Kate", "author_id": "2f6x4kxc", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "[This is how I pictured you in the movie hahaha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11WRQQKxhjk)", "created_utc": 1541393280.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e92vnu7", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_9u8u8a", "parent_id": "t1_e92pd42", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/9u8u8a/natalie_portman_thought_black_swan_was_going_to/e92vnu7/", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "krewwww", "author_id": "11djrn", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I saw short bus in theater without knowing what it was.
