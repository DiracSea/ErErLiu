These days, it's a lot of sitting around at a computer and managing the content. We usually receive films on physical hard drives in a [CRU housing] (https://www.bhphotovideo.com/images/images1000x1000/cru_dataport_6601_7100_0500_data_express_dx115_dc_1057892.jpg), and put that in a slot to ingest (download) the Feature to our main library. We can also download them from directly from the distributor or Deluxe/Technicolor (they used to be the main two, until they merged and now they distribute like 95% of films in US). From the library server, we push the Features to each projector as necessary. Each projector is equipped with a RAID-array set of hard drives to store the 100GB-300GB Features and all the necessary Trailers (usually about ~2-3GB each). Most theaters and chains are running a scheduled setup, but the one I'm at now has a projectionist on the clock at all times, and we do all of our starts manually.\n\n2. Get to? I get *paid* to. Each film we open on Fridays gets a tech-screening by one of our projectionists, usually on Wednesday nights. I definitely prefer having the theater to myself. I also get free passes to any non-sold-out film, as well as passes to any Landmark, Regal/United Artists, and Alamo Drafthouse theaters.\n\n3. I've never had to deal with a [brain wrap] (http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_hxG8FnBTv3U/R2rsL2SDvLI/AAAAAAAAAQ8/_-p-rsPV47E/s400/Brainwrap.jpg) first-hand, but I've heard a ton of horror stories. We still run 35mm prints occasionally, but we do it on a 2-projector reel-to-reel setup, like [this one] (http://lnl.wpi.edu/assets/img/projection/1.jpg), which is safer for the print itself, but requires a projectionist to run it.   \nFirst-hand, we were playing SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN and the one of the sprockets was broken, and it got caught in the gate of the projector (where the light comes through and the film passes by) and [melted Kristen Stewart's face] (http://i.imgur.com/UcDQ9Ae.jpg). I was also watching INTERSTELLAR on 70mm IMAX (not at a theater I worked at), and the print got a brain wrap about 45 minutes into it. Management told us what happened and that we would get free passes at the end, but that we were welcome to leave and get a full refund. I stayed. It took about a half hour to get up and going again, and then about 45 minutes from the end, it happened again. By this point it was already past 1am and management straight up said \"it's not going to be back on tonight, sorry\" and I got 3 free IMAX passes for it. So that's nice.\n\n4. I don't have any pictures of the booth I've worked in on-hand, but I can probably take some next time I'm in.\n\n5. It's awesome.

Arc lamps are extremely bright. They work by creating an arc between two metal rods inside of a pressurized xenon tube. I mean, its essentially like creating and using a continuous bolt of lightning as a light source... As you can imagine this creates a *lot* of heat. To deal with this, larger arc lamps actually have liquid cooling systems built into the lamp itself. \n\nTo deal with the heat, cinemas typically have a dedicated exhaust system with a cooling duct connected to the projector in order to siphon/blow out all the excess waste heat. Additionally they might have a dedicated intake duct to feed the projector cool air. This is one of the reasons that projection booths have to be soundproof because otherwise you would hear all the loud exhaust equipment and projector fans running.\n\n**Fun Fact:** Xenon arc lamps are pressurized to extremely high pressures (about 450psi) in order to achieve maximum efficiency. At these pressures they are basically like grenades if they are broken so depending on how large of a bulb you are dealing with, it can be *very* dangerous to handle and can require donning full-body safety gear and face shield.", "created_utc": 1499742816.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1499744717.0, "id": "dk22gnz", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6mi7r1", "parent_id": "t1_dk1y1so", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6mi7r1/bit_of_an_unusual_post_but_this_is_what_lurks/dk22gnz/", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "mowow", "author_id": "6uvur", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "[deleted]", "created_utc": 1499737375.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1521989973.0, "id": "dk1yeco", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6mi7r1", "parent_id": "t1_dk1y1so", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6mi7r1/bit_of_an_unusual_post_but_this_is_what_lurks/dk1yeco/", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "[deleted]", "created_utc": 1499737528.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1521989971.0, "id": "dk1yioa", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6mi7r1", "parent_id": "t1_dk1y4cr", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6mi7r1/bit_of_an_unusual_post_but_this_is_what_lurks/dk1yioa/", "score": 9, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Probably some kind of lease program that includes service and replacement.
