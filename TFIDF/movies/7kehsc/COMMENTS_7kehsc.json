Time keeper, schedule maker, and much more. It's a notoriously tough job that actually takes a great toll on people's lives.\n\nSo Claire Denis, writer, director, assistant director, and badass.

My cousin was a late bloomer and around 26 he decided it was time to stop raiding in WOW and find a woman and settle down. He signed up for a few online dating sites and matched with quite a few women- almost all of whom had \"Fifty Shades of Grey\" as one of their favorite novels. His best friend, a genuine ladies man, suggested he read them so he would have something to talk to the girls about on their dates. So my cousin starts reading them.\n\nWe were hanging out one day not long after he finished the first book and I could tell he wanted to talk to me but couldn't work up the nerve, so I just flat out asked him what was up. My cousin is a virgin and had zero experience with women, even hand holding. His face filled with mild terror and he tells me he just finished the first book and he's freaking out. I'm a girl so it took him a few tries to describe all of the sexual things in the book and in a near panic he asks me \"Misyo, how rejected am I going to be if I can't do all of that stuff? I mean, is that really what chicks want?\" After a pretty good laugh I explain to him that no, women won't reject you for not being Christian Grey (who in my opinion is an abusive manipulative cunt) and wrecking them in bed the first time. Oh, the relief on his face. He was also very concerned that women fantasize about abusive relationships too. So we had a very long talk about sex, fantasies, reality, expectation, and communication in relationships.\n\nStill though, the look on his face was priceless.", "created_utc": 1513554637.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "drecdfe", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7kehsc", "parent_id": "t1_drdw6iz", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7kehsc/robert_pattinson_set_to_star_in_french_art_house/drecdfe/", "score": 10, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "misyo", "author_id": "goje0", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "\u201cRead it for a girl\u201d\n\nLol cmon man, you\u2019re in a safe place.
