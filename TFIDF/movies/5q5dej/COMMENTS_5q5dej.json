I didn't honestly realize how long the Vietnam War went on for and how turbulent in general the 60s/70s were. \n\nI have been saying recently that I can't remember a time in my life where the world seemed as unstable and scary as it does right now. I was born in 1984, and the 90s-2000s certainly didn't feel this way, not even with 9/11, honestly. But I imagine that this is similar to how the world felt during the Cold War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, Vietnam.. we went through some scary years.\n\nDid you know that during the Cuban Missile Crisis, a Soviet nuclear-equipped sub came one vote away from launching nuclear missile at the US Navy? They were disabled and communications were down and they were taking hits and assumed total war had broken out, and the sub captain was going to fire a nuclear torpedo. But protocol required unanimous agreement of the three senior officers on board. Of the three, senior officers, one guy, [Vasili Arkhipov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasili_Arkhipov) vetoed it. This almost certainly prevented an all-out nuclear war that would have ensued.", "created_utc": 1485382489.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dcwng1c", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_5q5dej", "parent_id": "t1_dcwlb1b", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/5q5dej/mary_tyler_moore_dies_at_80/dcwng1c/", "score": 61, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "The big difference was we didn't have internet and 24/7 news back then.
