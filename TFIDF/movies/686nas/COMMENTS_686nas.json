The writers of the 2014 draft are still credited (in addition to the director) which means at least 30% of what they wrote is still there (by WGA rules). And it's garbage. Not just from an adaptation standpoint but from a writing one. Don't forget these are the same two that brought us The Amazing Spider-Man 2 with Batman and Robin level puns. \n\nAs for the script:\n[They have the shootout in Tull. Walter gives Alice the bartender the jawbone that makes her go crazy. No explanation about how these things work in mid world. Even though a show don't tell method. Roland isn't questing for the tower. He's on a mission to kill the man in black for reasons. Man in black knows about the cycles. \n\nBlack 13 works like the pink grapefruit of merlins rainbow. No one fears it. It's more like a magic 8 ball that the man in black looks into. \n\nThe script doesn't open with \"the line\". Instead at the Devar Toi with generic \"breakers\" - who we find out later one of them is Sheeemie for no damn reason. It's a fan service moment when someone calls out his name. Instead of Roland finding him at the end of his journey. \n\nThen we meet jake. Who everyone thinks is crazy. Drawing pictures of midworld. His therapist tells him to draw a hero and he draws Roland. I was going to lose my mind because I thought they were making jake that guy from book 7 with the magic pen and paper. They just allude to it heavily and say he has \"The Shine\".\n\nBy page 30 were in Drawing. Roland on beach, lost fingers and infected. Jake's dad is dead instead of a workaholic for some reason, either way his evil stepdad wants to send him to the crazy house so he leaves at gunpoint. To the \"the mansion\". In the script the monster was there, however in the leaked trailer there was no monster. It's here that I actually am hoping there were rewrites because the rest is even worse...\n\nSo Jake shows up happy to see Roland. Roland not so much. Jake almost walks into a thinnie- Wizard and Glass - seeing his dead dad. Roland saves him. Then Where do they go? The manni village of course. Henchick is mentioned in passing and there is a small \"festival\" with some dancing. Roland asks for a favor and the response is \"Well, since you just danced the come comolla, sure\". That one got me riled up because Wolves of the Callah is one of my favorites in the series. \n\nAt this point you're probably asking \"What's the movie even about?\"  Well sure. Sayer is tasked by Walter to get psychics to break the beams. Who is the strongest psychic? Jake of course! So they capture him, strap him in the \"breaker machine\" with Sheemie and Roland shoots him in the chest \"cross dimensions\" from the Dixie pig after he gives his \"There are other worlds than these\" line. \n\nSomehow this convinces Roland to take up the quest for the tower again. \n\nMy favorite part of the script is they omitted the tarot reading from Walter, and Roland finds the cards Prisoner, Lady of Sadows and The Boy not pusher in Alice's room after having sex. ](#spoiler)\n\nI'm a big Tower fan so I hope they changed the other 70% to something better. \n", "created_utc": 1493441601.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dgwctxs", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_686nas", "parent_id": "t3_686nas", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/686nas/new_image_of_idris_elba_as_the_gunslinger_in_the/dgwctxs/", "score": 11, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "YarrrImAPirate", "author_id": "7r1bd", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Biggest turd of the year right here.

DT will be mostly something new and even confusing for most of the audience.\nThe smartest move would be to tell the story like the comics did, all the way to young Roland and his first mission in Hambry with Bert and Alain, his first and last encounter with Susan, in one film.\nThen they could do a second one focusing on the fall of Gilead and the struggle Roland later had when he tried to take down John Farson, finishing the second movie in the Jericho Hill.\nThe third one evolves Roland in his search for the Dark Tower and the Man in Black, giving some background in the latest films, the audience can and will root for the gunslinger because they know how much he suffered.\nAnd so on, the could do another trilogy a few years later since roland can be any old man and focus on his last** attempt to pursue the Dark Tower.\n10 year worth in movies and a pretty solid fanbase, hundreds of millions dolars in WB pockets and a pretty gooddamn story.\nAnd yeah, they can make roland black, white, asian, arabic. It doesnt matter if they tell the story the way it should be told. Its a shame that this movie will be another bad taste in our mouths, King has a shitty taste for movies and everyone knows that.

And yeah, in terms of Rolands personality, the gritty voice etc - I have every faith he'll nail it.\n\nBut (avoid too many spoilers) there's actually a huge subplot in the later books that's precisely ABOUT race and racism. One of Rolands companions is a black woman who is involved in the civil rights movement, and her coming to terms with trusting a white man is a BIG part of it. He's not just white for no reason - Steven King is an old Liberal and has had no issues with a Black (or female) hero over the years.\n\nPlus here's the other issue: Roland himself is the foundation of the archetype of the Spaghetti Western Clint Eastwood cowboy. It's not that he looks like Clint Eastwood - his existence itself caused psychic \"ripples\" in the multiverse, so that he IS the prototype that we naturally envision when we think \"cowboy gunslinger\". The upshot is, he has to look basically like Clint Eastwood. So Matthew McConaughey could probably pull it off, but not Idris. \n\nBoth of those elements were central to the plot. It's like casting Chris Hemsworth as Django or something. Just.....no. And it doesn't bode well that they're choosing to do that.\n\nI mean, I'll still see it.
