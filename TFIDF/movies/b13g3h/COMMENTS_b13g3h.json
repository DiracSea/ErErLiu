Cutting is often a polishing of turds. I learned that early, on the first few films I edited. Directors are often egotistical hacks who lucked into the role and the editors are at their mercy, sometimes with the support of a producer who gets final say but not often. Usually you're left with a ton of notes and a lot of shit footage and you have the job of assembling that shit into a coherent, if not meaningful, piece of art/marketing/Oscar bait/barely-passable-as-a-movie movie. The director, if they know what they're doing, will have a clear plan laid out for their vision (storyboards) or, if they're a hack, will have a shot list and a script and a whole bunch of expectations that aren't mentioned until you show them something that doesn't meet them. They \"darling\" up to scenes, overestimate their own skills, and fear to be exposed as hacks. A good director gives you everything you need and lets you do your job, then gives some notes after each cut until everyone agrees it's ready. Very very rare to get a good director. I mean, George Harris can only make so many movies. Singer seems to pump em out. Take a guess what kind of director Singer is. He can occasionally get a good performance but he's not an auteur and he clearly lacks vision.\n\nSo, more to the point, the editing on this movie was fine. Enough so that I didn't hardly notice it when watching the film and I'm trained by Oscar winners, have tons of time cutting footage under my belt, and am extremely critical of editors and directors. In fact, I found the climactic scene of Live Aid to be incredibly compelling and well done. Yes there are lots of excessive cuts but, as is mentioned in many other posts, some of that is to give the different band members equal screen time, and some of it is the result of directors struggling to envision something beyond the stock \"coverage\" that makes a shit film. The movie was immediately criticized for lacking a style unique as the band deserves. Rightly so. However the editor is an industry pro, someone who has an incomparable expertise in their craft.

Everything almost everyone says is riddled with cliches and is soap opera quality. Take the scene mentioned in this editing video: Aiden Gillen's character asks what makes Queen great. Mercury responds with the most made-for-tv retort ever: \"We're four guys who don't belong together playing for the people in the back of the room who don't think they belong there!\" Aside from being eye-rollingly bad writing, where it was ever shown in the movie that these guys weren't *supposed* to be together. How are they shown to be playing those guys in the back of the room? The same kind of cliche writing comes in towards the end when Freddie is literally standing in the rain, giving a monologue about changing his life and dumping whoever his boy-toy was at the time. It's just... *bad* writing. It's so insincere and something you'd find in a Lifetime movie. \n\nI think Rami Malek is good in this movie but only in the concert scenes or the scenes where the band is in the recording studio. Those are the only times I really find myself believing that Malek is *performing* and *acting* like Freddie Mercury, as opposed to doing an impression of Freddie Mercury. The delivery, again, is really soap operatic and unconvincing to me, as a viewer. From a directorial standpoint... it's just average. There's nothing inspired about the *way* this movie was presented to the audience. It plays like every other biopic that came before it. Which is just completely overdone at this point, right on down to the \"I finally earned my father's respect and love\" scene at the end of the movie. Maybe that's the way this happened, I'm no Queen expert, but it's completely overdone in terms of movie-making. Find a fresh way to present and resolve that conflict and jazz up the formula. \n\nThat being said, Malek absolutely shines during the concert/recording rooms scenes. Those are the moments when his performance seems really inspired and you see him *become* Freddie Mercury.  The whole Live-Aid sequence was fucking brilliant. \n\nAgain, I don't hate this movie.

Generally when the score is a bit different or experimental or just feels like an integral part of the soundscape of a film to a point where you never even notice the score while watching the film - that's likely to be the front runner. The nominations are largely comprised of a mix between these types of nods and career achievement recognition.\n\nEditing nods are a bit different - editors talk a lot. More often than not, the editing nods are given with particular consideration to production struggles or particularly tricky technical solutions. A lot of the time, this also happens to be some very well-edited films - JFK, for instance, won largely for the technical feat of mixing filmstocks and post-production effects often in a single scene and still making it flow (particularly given the era of editing on actual film), that it had an incredible sense of pacing was kind of just a bonus. T2 was similarly nominated the same year for how seamlessly it mixed CGI and practical effects in the edit to a point where it's hard to pin down which is which. That it had some of the best edited action scenes in history is a bonus.\n\nBohemian Rhapsody is a case where production struggles made it kind of a miracle the finished film made any sense at all, and the Oscar was given not for the best editing but the biggest save in the edit. As the video above points out - there is no master shot with all 4 members of Queen and there's some serious lack of coverage as a result. That's already damn near unheard of on a production of that size - the kind of fuck up you'd expect on student films and no-name indies - even your rote Steven Segal movies don't have that level of shoddy craftsmanship. On top of that, there were likely many conflicting notes coming from both the new director hired to step in, the studio and the members of Queen themselves requiring x amount of screen time and a tight deadline with the delayed shoot cutting into the post-production schedule.\n\nCould it have been better edited with the footage they had? Definitely. Is it still a surprisingly cohesive (albeit mediocre) movie given the production? Absolutely. The fact that the movie is at all watchable in the first place is due to the editing. John Ottman earned his paycheck, even if he could've done better with what he had. Did he deserve the Oscar? It wasn't the Best Editing of the year, that's for sure.
