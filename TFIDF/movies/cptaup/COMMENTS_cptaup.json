Seriously wtf?   \n  \nArguably, the X-Men have some of the strongest female characters in Marvel comics, and yet over the course of seven dedicated X-Men films, instead of giving the spotlight to some of those characters, Fox and Singer instead kept beating a dead horse by focusing what they must have felt was the most important story point - Xavier and Magneto.  For seven films.  \n\nI hope Disney/Marvel can fix it, though I'm disappointed that, because Fox failed twice at it, we might not get another chance at a proper telling of the Phoenix story.", "created_utc": 1565719888.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "ews4aco", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_cptaup", "parent_id": "t1_ewru1tx", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/cptaup/fox_faces_pressure_at_disney_after_dark_phoenix/ews4aco/", "score": 20, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "krusty_venture", "author_id": "av64j", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Is Nightcrawler the type to do that?", "created_utc": 1565719555.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "ews3plv", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_cptaup", "parent_id": "t1_ewruhiq", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/cptaup/fox_faces_pressure_at_disney_after_dark_phoenix/ews3plv/", "score": 14, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "alex494", "author_id": "jgpco", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "If you mean Nightcrawler teleporting into someone else, I think that would kill both of them.
