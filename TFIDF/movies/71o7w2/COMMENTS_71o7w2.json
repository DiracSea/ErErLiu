John Williams is scoring the film. He prefers to work with a locked image. If you give him a locked picture and two months, he's can make stuff like the original Star Wars, Raiders, Superman, Schindler's List, Harry Potter, etc.\n\nIf you don't, you'll get something like Star Wars prequels.\n\nIt's hard to understand for people, because a lot of them don't even appreciate music. You can't do it if the cut is changing. It's not so easy to change your piece once it's in your head. Composers need a locked picture.\n\nMusic is incredibly important in film. It being left out and/or shitty is why a lot of modern films simply don't have the same effect like older ones. They are lacking an entire realm of storytelling. \n\nTake [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wJa1L1ZCqU) for example. I'm refering specifically to the last minute. Try watching it without sound. It drags on and on and on. It must've been a pain to edit and to envision it with music. \n\nNow watch it with sound. The music does all the work. Luke doesn't say a thing, but you know everything that's going through his head. And if you watch the rest of the movie, the theme will never repeat itself this way. It evolves and changes, just like the character. Luke is never again a lonely boy dreaming of big things. It's only in this scene. \n\nThis is what's lacking today. Directors not leaving room for music to tell the story along the picture, and wanting composers to score to image that's not locked, and then cutting their music. That sure is doable, but you don't get the same thing. It can never be. \n\nTake Inception for example. Or any Hans Zimmer score (I'm giving an example, this is especially noticeable in Batman). None of the themes evolve. They stay the same. Inception has a few themes that appear in the same way, structurally and harmonically. Same for Batman, it's always that crescendo-decrescendo in horns playing D and F. Even as Bruce overcomes his fears, finds his true self, his music stays the same - it's not saying anything. \n\nInception wasn't even scored. Hans and his team wrote a bunch of demos that Nolan then cut the movie to. These are just instrumental pieces. Don't get me wrong, it's great music. It's super cool. It works lovely as standalone music in an album, even in concert (Coachella anyone?). Tunes from Inception have millions of views and streams. But that's just it. It's just music (great nonetheless), not a filmscore.\n\nSorry for the long post, I just wanted to say that if you're having John Williams score your movie, you make sure that he has a locked picture in his hands for at least two months.\n\nEDIT: A word.", "created_utc": 1506066167.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1506069767.0, "id": "dnch2hr", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_71o7w2", "parent_id": "t1_dnc8s1a", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/71o7w2/director_rian_johnson_announces_that_post/dnch2hr/", "score": 470, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "At least we don't have the scares of reedits and reboots we had with ep 7 and rogue one", "created_utc": 1506055352.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dncc8jb", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_71o7w2", "parent_id": "t1_dnc8s1a", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/71o7w2/director_rian_johnson_announces_that_post/dncc8jb/", "score": 53, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "FiniteMonster", "author_id": "6cuc9", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "You guys have to remember this movie was scheduled to come out last December.", "created_utc": 1506066413.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dnch5ly", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_71o7w2", "parent_id": "t1_dnc8s1a", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/71o7w2/director_rian_johnson_announces_that_post/dnch5ly/", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "dm117", "author_id": "6uuxi", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "How does he have so much credibility?

The Superman theme from Man of Steel is manipulated depending on the situation, often changed and misrepresented to show the way Clark is perceived by the public and Batman. The links between that theme and Lex and Doomsday's respective themes raises some interesting questions as well.\n\nThe use of the themes from Man of Steel, particularly from the scene of Lara's death to Martha's being threatened, the battle between Zod and Clark being reused in the BvS fight showing that Batman is becomig what he feared all along; all of these show thematic and character evolution.\n\nFinally, the integration of the Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman themes in the second half of \"Is She With You?\" (People only remember the Wondy bit) shows the characters' cohesion.\n\nIt's a far more advanced score than Zimmer has ever done; it's a shame it gets so overlooked just because people don't appreciate the film.", "created_utc": 1506077442.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dnckzky", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_71o7w2", "parent_id": "t1_dnch2hr", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/71o7w2/director_rian_johnson_announces_that_post/dnckzky/", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Smurphy98", "author_id": "qvv22", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Picture lock happens wayyyy before post processing starts dude.
