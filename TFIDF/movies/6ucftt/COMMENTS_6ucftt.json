He stares into the light of his laser sword. He finds a way to the outskirts of the Lars moisture farm to keep an eye on young Skywalker. This is his routine. \n\nUntil one day during his hunt he finds a injured Middle aged woman on his usual path. He wants to mind his own business, stay anonymous. But the goodness inside convinces him to act. He helps the lady but she is on death's door; delusional. dehydrated. \n\nBen gets the woman to his home. She's needed several days to recover. When she is able, she frantically tells Ben of her two daughters. They've been abducted by the Sand People. She was as well, but after torturing her, they released her. Ben knows he can't do anything. He's the last of the Jedi, but he's alone. But he's still Jedi. So he decides to help find the daughters. Ben won't admit it, but he's happy to have some excitement in his life again.\n\nAfter doing detective work, Ben finds the Tuskin Raiders group that abducted the girls. They aren't forthcoming and attack. Ben tries not to hurt them, but they get the upper hand. So Ben does what he didn't want to do. He pulls out his lightsaber and the Tuskin Raiders are scared shitless. Ben defeats them and find his way into the pen in the cave. No one there. A lone protocol damaged droid reveals the Tuskin have sold their abductees. \n\nBen and the woman go to Mos Eisley where Ben has to befriend smugglers to find out who would be willing to buy slaves from the Sand People. He eventually joins a crew to get to a planet where the girls were sent. He cannot reveal himself as a Jedi so he has to go undercover as a smuggler. He gets in many fights before reaching the girls. All the while using blasters, his fist, and secretly his force powers. In the climax, as he is about to save the girls, he nearly pulls out his lightsaber, but finds another way not to make it obvious he is Jedi.\n\nHe saves the girls, and gets them back to Tattooine. He goes back to his usual routine. Years pass. He's secretly bored again. Until he gets a visitor at his door. It's young Skywalker.

The little glimpses of Coruscant,and Mustafar in Rogue One were neat. \n    ", "created_utc": 1503042862.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dlsgrgm", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6ucftt", "parent_id": "t1_dlsa430", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6ucftt/stephen_daldry_to_direct_standalone_obiwan_kenobi/dlsgrgm/", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "SupremeLeaderSnoke", "author_id": "nrp5p", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I don't think you've ever heard a genuinely thick Scottish accent - he's very neutral and well-spoken ", "created_utc": 1503056876.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dlsm9ta", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6ucftt", "parent_id": "t1_dlsamqt", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6ucftt/stephen_daldry_to_direct_standalone_obiwan_kenobi/dlsm9ta/", "score": 8, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "nigeltheginger", "author_id": "62smk", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I thought that was Luke all this time.", "created_utc": 1503023040.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dls5wac", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6ucftt", "parent_id": "t1_dlryyee", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6ucftt/stephen_daldry_to_direct_standalone_obiwan_kenobi/dls5wac/", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "luger718", "author_id": "6dro5", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Just ramming the fuck out of them.", "created_utc": 1503019932.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dls3h7y", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6ucftt", "parent_id": "t1_dls19sc", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6ucftt/stephen_daldry_to_direct_standalone_obiwan_kenobi/dls3h7y/", "score": 8, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "AerThreepwood", "author_id": "fqj64", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "It's senator then.", "created_utc": 1503015905.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dls0acu", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6ucftt", "parent_id": "t1_dlrzm1j", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6ucftt/stephen_daldry_to_direct_standalone_obiwan_kenobi/dls0acu/", "score": 376, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "MoffKalast", "author_id": "d2nyh", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Yep ", "created_utc": 1503020367.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dls3tjd", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6ucftt", "parent_id": "t1_dlrzm1j", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6ucftt/stephen_daldry_to_direct_standalone_obiwan_kenobi/dls3tjd/", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "captwafflepants", "author_id": "duvlf", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Dewwit.", "created_utc": 1503019297.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dls2yqs", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6ucftt", "parent_id": "t1_dlrz9io", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6ucftt/stephen_daldry_to_direct_standalone_obiwan_kenobi/dls2yqs/", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Derplord1239", "author_id": "1220ia", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "[deleted]", "created_utc": 1503019353.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dls30dr", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6ucftt", "parent_id": "t1_dls2ukp", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6ucftt/stephen_daldry_to_direct_standalone_obiwan_kenobi/dls30dr/", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I just want more prequels", "created_utc": 1503018245.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dls24ig", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6ucftt", "parent_id": "t1_dls1uri", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6ucftt/stephen_daldry_to_direct_standalone_obiwan_kenobi/dls24ig/", "score": 13, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "l0ve2h8urbs", "author_id": "7tzgk", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Michael Fassbender would make an amazing Thrawn.", "created_utc": 1503027167.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dls8s6a", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_6ucftt", "parent_id": "t1_dls1uri", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/6ucftt/stephen_daldry_to_direct_standalone_obiwan_kenobi/dls8s6a/", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "INTHEMIDSTOFLIONS", "author_id": "eb2ez", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "But think about it, Samuel L Jackson played a warrior with ridiculous ability, but still played the calm, cool headed nature of a Jedi master. \n\n\nThat's some serious acting range for a guy who usually is far from the quietest guy on screen.
