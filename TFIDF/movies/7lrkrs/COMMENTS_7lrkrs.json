Django certainly felt like a bit of the cohesiveness that is typical in his films was lost\n\nDon't get me wrong, I have a ton of problems with Django, specifically it's length, but, I'm not sure what aspects come down to the editor, since it can vary incredibly from director to director. Did she have Tarantino's ear for cutting scenes? Or is it more likely the case of Tarantino writing a script that is just a bit sloppier or wider-scoped. \n\nLike, to me, Tarantino's best work is Inglorious Basterds because of how tight it is. And the individual scenes are very well-edited, but, also the structure as a whole is very tight which is due the way it's written (it's a movie of very few scenes, to the point where you could probably do it as a stage play), in a way that Django felt like it needed a pruning in the script stage moreso than in the editing booth. \n\nI'm not indicating anything either way. She was clearly a very talented editor (take that bar scene in Inglourious Basterds, where you have like 6 different actors playing off of each other), I'm just not 100% sure on whether we can account the lack of cohesion in Django and even Hateful Eight to the editor's end, or Tarantino's writing become looser and more overindulgent. But having said that, it's equally plausible that both movies could've ended up far tighter with her work on it. \n\nSo, I guess what I'm saying, is .. that .. I don't know what I'm saying.
