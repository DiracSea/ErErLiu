[{"body": "Lots of cartoon characters wear neck ties or collared shirts too... why?\n\nNecks are a pain in the ass to draw. Separate the body from the neck and you can animate the head separately from the body.\n\nAlso...\n\nCartoons are drawn on transparent layers and although these layers are transparent, light still has to pass through them and when it does some of the 'brightness' is lost. The further away the layer is from the light source, the darker it will be.\n\nSo you would draw George Jetsons body on one layer, and his head on another. But the light won't shine through both layers evenly and you might end up with Jetsons head being slighter darker then his body.\n\nIf you put his head on his neck, you would notice the color change.\n\nTo make this less notable, animators would add a neck tie or a collar or a necklace to separate the head from the neck, so the slight color difference wouldn't be noticed. \n\nPeople who color would try to compensate for this light difference and chose darker or lighter colors but it was almost impossible to guess. That's why in a say, a Scooby Doo cartoon, a static bookshelf is one color, but the book the character interacts with stands out as a different color. \n", "created_utc": 1486053563.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dd8ode1", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_5rn8ku", "parent_id": "t3_5rn8ku", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/5rn8ku/why_animators_had_their_cartoon_characters_wear/dd8ode1/", "score": 5103, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I always thought the reason cartoon birds didn't have gloves was so they could spread their wings and fly.", "created_utc": 1486052958.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dd8ntck", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_5rn8ku", "parent_id": "t3_5rn8ku", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/5rn8ku/why_animators_had_their_cartoon_characters_wear/dd8ntck/", "score": 826, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "pesakaio", "author_id": "dvla5", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "- Time saving measure.\n- Better contrast in the time of black and white films.\n- Anthropomorphize non-human characters\n- Inspiration from vaudeville\n\nEdit: \n\nFixed typo, blah and white -> black and white\nAlso, my highest rated comment is helpful \\o/.
