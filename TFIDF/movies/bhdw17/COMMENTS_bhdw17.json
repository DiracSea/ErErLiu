Spielberg has never been at war with Netflix. It's even been widely reported that places like Indiewire completely fabricated things to make it more dramatic than it was.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/23/business/media/steven-spielberg-netflix-academy-awards.html\n\n>His primary beef is not with Netflix, according to the people close to him. Rather, he is frustrated that exhibitors have been unwilling to compromise. The multiplex chains have fought off any effort to shorten the exclusive period they get to play films of any genre, which is currently about 90 days. In January, after \u201cRoma\u201d was nominated for the best picture Oscar, Mr. Spielberg even called AMC and Regal, the largest theater companies, and implored them to play the Netflix film even though it was already available online. They refused.\n\nAnd let's not forget: Spielberg has produced and made content for Netflix! He's made stuff for Amazon, and is now working on a show for Apple.\n\nAlmost all of the new outlets are also parroting his interview with ITV from a year ago, using a quote taken out of context to justify a story that Spielberg is out to get Netflix, but has anyone actually watched that portion of the interview?\n\nhttps://youtu.be/_hTTvO50QTs?t=265\n\n>It is a challenge to cinema, the same way that television was to cinemas in the 1950's... Hollywood is used to that, we're used to being highly competitive to television. The difference is that most studios today are interested in making guaranteed tentpole movies from their inventory, as opposed to taking chances on smaller films, and those smaller films - that studios used to make routinely - they're going to Hulu, Amazon, Netflix... Television is thriving with quality and art, but it does pose a threat to film goers... I'm just saying that fewer and fewer filmmakers are going to compete in Sundance... or get a specialty label to get their films released theaterically... and more and more will go to SVOD businesses to finance their films, maybe with a promise of a slight theatrical window to qualify them as a movie, but in fact once you commit to a television format, you're a TV movie... I don't believe that films that are given token qualifications in a couple of theaters for less than a week should qualify for a Academy nomination.\n\nSo instead of a nuanced take on the matter, where Spielberg publicly praises television for having better storytelling going on than in big films today, we get a soundbyte that completely cuts off his point and manufactures outrage.", "created_utc": 1556285548.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "eltuvq6", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_bhdw17", "parent_id": "t1_eltj5ih", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/bhdw17/former_actor_corey_feldman_has_completed_a/eltuvq6/", "score": 125, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Definitely.

A biographer of Michael Jackson, Mike Smallcombe, was able to uncover these problems, including perhaps the most egregious one quoted here:\n\n>For example, James Safechuck claims in his sworn declaration that he was abused from 1988 until 1992, when he was 14. Safechuck said the abuse stopped at age 14 because that was when he reached puberty.  \n>  \n>In Leaving Neverland, Safechuck describes in vivid detail that Jackson abused him in an upstairs room at Neverland\u2019s main train station \u201cevery day\u201d they were together at the ranch during that time period, up until 1992.  \n>  \n>But [construction permits which I sourced recently](https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/leaving-neverland-director-makes-embarrassing-14221624) show that the train station build wasn\u2019t approved until September 1993. Construction began shortly after, and the building didn\u2019t open until the first part of 1994, when Safechuck was 16 and had reached the height of an adult.  \n>  \n>In addition, Safechuck says in his sworn declaration that after 1992, he only visited Neverland in \"late 1995 or early 1996\", by which time he was 18.  \n>  \n>An aerial image of Neverland, taken by press photographer Steven Starr on August 25, 1993 and licensed by Getty Images, also shows that building work on the train station had not even started. Starr this week confirmed to me that the picture was taken on that date.  \n>  \n>So any abuse in the train station cannot have happened until Safechuck was on the cusp of adulthood.\n\nThe director of the documentary, Dan Reed, actually recently publicly embarrassed himself on twitter by attempting to use an out-of-context quote to prove that this train station was actually built in 1993, [only to be called out by the speaker of that very quote.](https://twitter.com/harrisonfunk/status/1120358183384559616)\n\nSuch an inconsistency cannot simply be passed off as misremembering dates, because the entire narrative of the film (that Michael Jackson abandons boys once they hit puberty) is called into question, and the fact that this means James Safechuck committed perjury (as he said in his court case that the abuse ended in 1992).", "created_utc": 1556238099.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "elsi7n2", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_bhdw17", "parent_id": "t1_elsdlqj", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/bhdw17/former_actor_corey_feldman_has_completed_a/elsi7n2/", "score": 124, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "shivj80", "author_id": "pix3r", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "You need more upvotes man", "created_utc": 1556287391.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "eltxtqg", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_bhdw17", "parent_id": "t1_eltuvq6", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/bhdw17/former_actor_corey_feldman_has_completed_a/eltxtqg/", "score": 13, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "MuchaLuchaMacnCheese", "author_id": "3jivhoe5", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "[Quiet you!](https://media.giphy.com/media/l0MYOkOtDYY1TLmQU/giphy.gif)", "created_utc": 1556296438.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "elud8zv", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_bhdw17", "parent_id": "t1_eltuvq6", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/bhdw17/former_actor_corey_feldman_has_completed_a/elud8zv/", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "drunkdaze", "author_id": "bybsa", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "And it's free", "created_utc": 1556241282.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "elsnfpi", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_bhdw17", "parent_id": "t1_elsme93", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/bhdw17/former_actor_corey_feldman_has_completed_a/elsnfpi/", "score": 1087, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "mookiebomber", "author_id": "3oojn", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "YouTube has been a cornerstone of the internet for almost 15 years.", "created_utc": 1556241280.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "elsnflt", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_bhdw17", "parent_id": "t1_elsmeae", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/bhdw17/former_actor_corey_feldman_has_completed_a/elsnflt/", "score": 124, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Deeliciousness", "author_id": "h74a8", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Pornhub", "created_utc": 1556242354.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "elsp83z", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_bhdw17", "parent_id": "t1_elsmzud", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/bhdw17/former_actor_corey_feldman_has_completed_a/elsp83z/", "score": 52, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Pustuli0", "author_id": "8khkm", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "All it takes is some fucker copyright claiming it and it's taken down without question...", "created_utc": 1556240957.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "elsmw3d", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_bhdw17", "parent_id": "t1_elsmk3q", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/bhdw17/former_actor_corey_feldman_has_completed_a/elsmw3d/", "score": 69, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "SingleAlmond", "author_id": "11r654it", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Im guessing no one's touching it because is highly slanderous.
