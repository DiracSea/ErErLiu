But i LOVED Terminator Genesys. \n\nIt was terrible, but entertaining as all hell. \n\nI loved the remade scenes from the first and second terminator, i loved old Arnold. \n\nI loved Khaleesi as the most huggable Sarah Connie ever (but definitely happy Linda Hamilton is coming back) \n\nAnd actually the \"enemy\" terminator was pretty bad ass, and their fight at the end was pretty damn good. \n\nNo, it wasn't a good movie, like at all. But it made the fanboy in me happy. \n\nThis might be the worst movie of all time... But they already have my ticket money.

Or rather, didn't lead to character growth or plot development. Such as the inclusion of the pilot lady, a random attempted rape scene, and a big highway chase sequence that looked cool, but didn't really lead anywhere important.\n\nAlso the POV character was Sam Worthington. And to each their own, but...he's not all that interesting as a lead. Especially next to Christian Bale immediately after The Dark Knight. And doubly when this is supposed to be the audiences first look into the future after judgement day, with Jon Connor. Instead Jon is shunted to the side, both by the screenplay and the resistance leaders themselves.\n\nThe T2 future war tone was also quite different. Instead of [black skies and grey ash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Mg7qKstnPk), it was a lot of [orange dry lands and tarmac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLasBsoZBi0). And rather than all the exotic looking laser/plasma weapons, it appears that everyone is just using conventional firearms. It almost didn't seem like the same fictional universe.\n\nAnd the finale had this really weird plot contrivance. In which a machine that was programmed by Skynet was able to consciously stop the plans of Skynet, seemingly of its own free will. Scuppering everything for the machines in an instant. Why wouldn't he just immediately revert back to his programming and fall in line? And why would a machine intelligence *not* take precautions otherwise. It *knows* it's own units can be subverted by the resistance because it's happened before. So why didn't it prepare for that possibility? Have 6-7 terminators just pull Sam Worthington apart. Rebuild him later.\n\nAlso wasn't the plan to kill Jon Conner? And they are using Kyle Reese as bait? Meaning Jon will go wherever they want him to go. And yet they deploy a single Arnold unit to [throw him around a bit.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XLu_NTu4aY) Why not dispatch 6 terminators? Or 12? Or 52? Or just one with a gun that would *immediately* shoot him and win the war.\n\nOr heck...just seal the doors and remotely detonate a concealed thermobaric weapon to set the air on fire? Or nerve gas the entire compound. Pull some DNA from the corpse and check it against Reese, since they *know* it's his father. Once the kill is confirmed, punch Kyle's head in. Or give him a hot meal and send him back in time to the first film. Whatever seals the time loop. Once that's done, Skynet has won. They can wrap up the genocide and go about rebuilding the planet in whatever manner a machine race desires.\n\nMuch of the plot moves along because the villain is stupid.", "created_utc": 1554401119.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1554404092.0, "id": "ek49b7s", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_b9ck91", "parent_id": "t1_ek3rxpc", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/b9ck91/first_picture_of_arnold_schwarzenegger_in/ek49b7s/", "score": 84, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "SovietWomble", "author_id": "d4dhm", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "It's perhaps comparable to Prometheus and Covenant - compared to the previous movies, everything is dumber.
