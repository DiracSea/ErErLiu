I mean Genndy got the Samurai Jack revival, Netflix loves reviving cult classics, and I know several Genndy movies and shows have been/are on Netflix so he's gotta be able to at least get a foot in the door there right?\n\nThere were just so many things left unresolved, so many plotlines teased and foreshadowed that were never delved into in the depth that was clearly planned, so many world elements to explore in further depth, and so many more hilarious interactions for Octus to get into. \n\n", "created_utc": 1531307803.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e26ntwl", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8xshzz", "parent_id": "t1_e25ejro", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8xshzz/samurai_jack_creator_genndy_tartakovsky_is/e26ntwl/", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "WolfgangMaddox", "author_id": "137562", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Tell them to me baby \ud83e\udd24", "created_utc": 1531265169.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e25rp2s", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8xshzz", "parent_id": "t1_e25ejro", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8xshzz/samurai_jack_creator_genndy_tartakovsky_is/e25rp2s/", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "BasicSpidertron", "author_id": "pqx9q", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "As someone who never bothered touching it when it aired, are there any *legal* means of watching it online?", "created_utc": 1531267935.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e25unxk", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8xshzz", "parent_id": "t1_e25ejro", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8xshzz/samurai_jack_creator_genndy_tartakovsky_is/e25unxk/", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "ACrispyPieceOfBacon", "author_id": "pxvog", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "SAME.", "created_utc": 1531271673.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e25ylw4", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8xshzz", "parent_id": "t1_e25ejro", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8xshzz/samurai_jack_creator_genndy_tartakovsky_is/e25ylw4/", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "callbuffy", "author_id": "gmbia", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Oh my god yes.", "created_utc": 1531266867.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e25tivw", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8xshzz", "parent_id": "t1_e25qo40", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8xshzz/samurai_jack_creator_genndy_tartakovsky_is/e25tivw/", "score": 36, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "centersolace", "author_id": "8w6t6", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Oh sweet lord, I only realized just now that this is all I ever wanted...", "created_utc": 1531268859.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1531269113.0, "id": "e25vn05", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8xshzz", "parent_id": "t1_e25qo40", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8xshzz/samurai_jack_creator_genndy_tartakovsky_is/e25vn05/", "score": 25, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "kingdomheartsislight", "author_id": "5cv68x7", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Tighten up the last couple chapters so it actually builds to a climax instead of meandering around and we're golden.", "created_utc": 1531267923.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e25unhl", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8xshzz", "parent_id": "t1_e25qo40", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8xshzz/samurai_jack_creator_genndy_tartakovsky_is/e25unhl/", "score": 15, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "gaylordqueen69", "author_id": "fmpy3", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "They tried doing that years ago, and Jeff Smith was clever enough to retain complete creative control (undoubtedly because, as an animator himself, he knew what was about to happen)\n\nThe rumour goes that he pulled the plug on his own movie when the studio wouldn't stop pestering him to add modern pop songs and musical numbers to the soundtrack", "created_utc": 1531292894.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e26girs", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8xshzz", "parent_id": "t1_e25qo40", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8xshzz/samurai_jack_creator_genndy_tartakovsky_is/e26girs/", "score": 6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "secretlightkeeper", "author_id": "a28kakp", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "There is actually an adaptation of Bone in the works at Warner Animation Group with Mark Osbourne attached as director.

So when your source material is already exclusively 2D, it makes more sense to make the adaptation in 2D as well in order to better align with the art style rather than complicate things and deal with imagining a 2D character's stylized facial proportions into a sensical 3D object.\n\nLike look at [Violet Evergarden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CJeDetA45Q) that came out this year: this was a TV show, not even a movie.

With the right story idea, and marketing towards an adult audience (rather than towards children or families), I think that a 2D animated film, if good quality, would do very well. We've also seen an interest in \"adult animation\" with shows like *Rick and Morty*, *South Park*, *Bojack Horseman*, *The Boondocks*, etc.\n\nGenndy's last season of *Samurai Jack*, and the buzz surrounding it, after all, was primarily due to adult audiences, who had grown up watching the series as children, taking a large interest in it. With the right premise, an R-rated / PG-13-rated *Samurai Jack* stand-alone animated film could also potentially do well.\n\nOnce, back in the 70's, an animator by the name of [Ralph Bakshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Bakshi) made a well-known, and X-rated, cartoon for adults titled *Fritz the Cat* (1972). It also addressed political, cultural, and social issues of the time, and was a huge financial success.\n\n> The film stars Fritz (voiced by Skip Hinnant), an anthropomorphic cat in mid-1960s New York City, who explores the ideals of hedonism and sociopolitical consciousness. The film is a satire focusing on American college life of the era, race relations, the free love movement, and left- and right-wing politics.\n\n> The film had a troubled production history, and controversial release. Crumb, one of the creators, had disagreements with the filmmakers over the film's political content. \n\n> *Fritz the Cat* was controversial for its rating and content, which many viewers at the time found to be offensive. It was produced on a budget of $700,000 (~$4.2 million in 2018), and grossed over $90 million (~$536 million in 2018) worldwide. \n\n> Its success led to a slew of other X-rated animated films and a sequel, *The Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat* (1974), made without Crumb's or Bakshi's involvement. (Wikipedia)\n\nGet Ralph Bakshi back in the planning and directing of an R-rated, 2D animated film, with a *good* premise, and I can guarantee the film will likely be a hit with adult audiences. Bakshi himself has been looking to get back into the animation industry since 2013, and successfully released a movie in 2015 funded entirely through Kickstarter (*[Last Days of Coney Island](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSPmqLQA3SA)*). \n\nBakshi was able to make the 22-minute-film with about ~$175,000 of funding. If we extend that to, say, a 140-minute film, Bakshi could probably make it for about ~$1.3 million. If released in theaters, it could easily make back its budget and then some for whatever Hollywood studio wanted to finance, and distribute, the movie. \n\nAs for potential premises? I could see the DCEU (which already produces quality animated films) potentially being salvaged this way on the big screen in the future, and reworked, to become a series of R-rated, darker, 2D animated films. This could also fill a nice niche, and provide a *very* different approach from, and opposite foil for, Marvel's live-action superhero films. \n\nI think that Batman, and maybe even Teen Titans or Nightwing, would probably be best served by this change, in the same vein of Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. Using Teen Titans in particular, in 2D animation, but adapted for an adult audience, I feel would also draw in a lot of old fans of the original TV series. Darker aspects of the *Teen Titans* comic book series could also be explored this way, as well as \"modernize\" the content to reflect the modern political atmosphere in the US.\n\nWith Bakshi at the helm, and at least* allowed a lot of creative control, we could get what Bakshi had originally planned for *Cool World* (1992), but with the Batman / DCEU universe. Bakshi is also very good at addressing political content in an artful way in his animated features, which I feel could also fit in quite well with the DCEU / Batman themes, lore, and comic book arcs.", "created_utc": 1531263906.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1531270807.0, "id": "e25qb36", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8xshzz", "parent_id": "t1_e25gzzj", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8xshzz/samurai_jack_creator_genndy_tartakovsky_is/e25qb36/", "score": 61, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Obversa", "author_id": "k11a2", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Regardless of my attachment to 2D animation, the idea that a kid is like \u201cthis 2d stuff doesn\u2019t look as good\u201d make me irrationally annoyed.

Pointing to Brother Bear is a cheap shot against 2D animation of the time too; I could just as easily tell you to look at Chicken Little, which released a year later to a similarly lukewarm reception.\n\n3D movies are also NOT associated with quality during this time period or in modernity by any stretch of the imagination. 3D movies are very cheap to produce compared to 2d animation, especially traditional 2d animation. As a result, many studios decided to take the approach of throwing shit at the wall and seeing what sticks. Sort animated movies by score on Metacritic and you'll find that a large portion of the low-rated ones are 3D. I also recommend taking a look at what is offered on Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, and Hoopla - the market is absolutely flooded with low quality 3D animation and it just keeps rolling in.\n\nIf there was *ever* a time when 3D animation was associated with quality, it was in the mid to late 90s, and even that is questionable given the existence of VeggieTales, which was the only player in the market prior to Pixar, (and continues into modernity.) The perception of 3D animation being associated with quality was absolutely crushed with the release of Dinosaur in 2000, which was a monstrosity.\n\n--------------\n\nTo be clear, I'm not saying that 3d animation is bad or that 2d animation is better. What I am saying however is that if we were get an average rating of all 3d animated movies in the past ten years and an average of 2d animated films and compare the two that 2d films would almost certainly have a higher score.", "created_utc": 1531270974.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1531289532.0, "id": "e25xvgg", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8xshzz", "parent_id": "t1_e25pp08", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8xshzz/samurai_jack_creator_genndy_tartakovsky_is/e25xvgg/", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Cornthulhu", "author_id": "gy5nf", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "As is tradition.", "created_utc": 1531269704.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e25wiyc", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8xshzz", "parent_id": "t1_e25t9op", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8xshzz/samurai_jack_creator_genndy_tartakovsky_is/e25wiyc/", "score": 4, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "MagentaHawk", "author_id": "ophf9", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "That new live action one looks like it's shooting for the kind of good-natured humor that the Paddington movies nailed so well.", "created_utc": 1531271264.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e25y6a1", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8xshzz", "parent_id": "t1_e25sg1r", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8xshzz/samurai_jack_creator_genndy_tartakovsky_is/e25y6a1/", "score": 6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "ArcadianBlueRogue", "author_id": "bk9vl8d", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Compared to a standard animated bug budget feature, the later Pooh films were not produced or animated by the US feature division with the exception of the 2011 feature.

In this episode, the trouble starts when Ashi begins using Aku's powers. There's nothing inherently wrong with it, and it does make for great comeuppance for Aku's manipulating of Ashi. However, it's immediately realized that Ashi can send Jack back and they do so with haste.\n\nWhile Aku's reaction is almost comical, that's the last we see of the future. I was personally fine with it at first, but later on I will explain how this ended up hurting the episode.\n\nThe battle with past Aku, from my personal opinion, is great. If you don't particularly find it satisfying, part of my thought process is that Jack must have thought for years what he would do once he got back to the past. What attacks he would use and how not to be tricked by Aku once more. Much like the last time portal, Jack did not hesitate and Aku was finished.\n\nHowever, the resolution is where we begin to go downhill. Jack, unlike his father, is able to successfully destroy Aku. The world is saved and the future that is Aku is no more. Yet, Ashi remains and only serves to confirm that Aku is indeed destroyed. This is where she should have began vanishing. Time travel is always a complicated mess, but ultimately I feel many viewers would have preferred Ashi's *death* to occur alongside Aku's death.\n\nIn a poetic sense, both Aku's tower and Ashi would have fallen. One heralding the beginning of a new future, and the other the ending of a prior future.\n\nThe wedding scene was an emotional sucker punch. For those of us who have seen Gurren Lagann, we were apprehensive rather than capable of enjoying the beauty of the ceremony and the design of Ashi's dress. That Jack's mentors and friends of the past were there to celebrate, only for them to witness the loss of someone dear to Jack. Even from a writing standpoint, it's rather emotionally manipulative to allude that Ashi had survived for a long duration to where she would vanish at her own wedding.\n\nBecause of this tragedy, it mars the symbolism and hopeful nature of the final scene to the average viewer. Only a few minutes ago a character dies and it's expected the viewer will have the clarity to understand the symbolism behind the fog, forest, and ladybug.\n\nOf course, it's one thing to criticize an episode and not offer an alternative. The problem I mentioned earlier about immediately going back to the past is, without realizing it, that's the last we have of the future and its characters. It's just gone and there's no recognition of it. So I present:\n\n**LEGENDS**\n\nAs Aku's tower falls, Ashi falls alongside it. Jack holds her and asks what is wrong and what he can do. Ashi explains that she no longer has a father. Jack tries to comfort her, saying he loves her, but in reality he's the one needing to be comforted. Ashi quiets him and simply says, \"I love you.\"\n\nAnd she is gone.\n\nJack's homeland is restored, and there is to be a celebration. Jack's mentors and old friends have come far and wide. Jack's parents are greeting them, but Jack is not to be found. It transitions to Jack, outside the village under a tree. He should be happy; he is back to the home he, for a long time, only dreamed of. His people are saved, as is the whole world, but there are people only he knows that are no more.\n\nChildren of the village call out to him. Here we learn of Jack's true name! One asks, \"Is it true you were in the future?\" \"Yeah, what was it like,\" and \"Were the people really different from us?\" Jack is hesitant, mostly because it hurts to think about it.\n\n\"Yes, my son, could you tell us all?\" His father, his mother, and everyone who came to celebrate have come to aid Jack in this difficult time. Jack begins to smile, and he prepares to tell a tale.\n\n\"They called me Jack.\"\n\n**EPISODE CI**\u201d", "created_utc": 1531270114.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e25wyoa", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8xshzz", "parent_id": "t1_e25vgk6", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8xshzz/samurai_jack_creator_genndy_tartakovsky_is/e25wyoa/", "score": 195, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "MuffaloMan", "author_id": "o3drb", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I always assumed he was hundreds of years in the future from his DoB.", "created_utc": 1531275785.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e262z5s", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8xshzz", "parent_id": "t1_e261xi6", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8xshzz/samurai_jack_creator_genndy_tartakovsky_is/e262z5s/", "score": 6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "sybrwookie", "author_id": "9nf1k", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "About that time, yeah.", "created_utc": 1531276547.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e263rap", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8xshzz", "parent_id": "t1_e2632yi", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8xshzz/samurai_jack_creator_genndy_tartakovsky_is/e263rap/", "score": 11, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "SimplyQuid", "author_id": "6ud25", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "HAND DRAWN", "created_utc": 1531283290.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e269zc9", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8xshzz", "parent_id": "t1_e25s7yc", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8xshzz/samurai_jack_creator_genndy_tartakovsky_is/e269zc9/", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "KOH_NW", "author_id": "hzzb3", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "> Jokes aside, the animation quality mostly has to do with Ufotable outright refusing to outsource any part of it.
