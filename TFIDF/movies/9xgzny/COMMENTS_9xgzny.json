Jim is similarly paralyzed by his inability to handle his romantic feelings for Maggie. In fact, in Season two, he skips town and takes a demotion to be an embed with the Romney campaign because he can\u2019t stand being around her. If anyone can\u2019t seem to separate their romantic and professional lives in this show, it\u2019s the men.*\n\n>*Meanwhile, Mac goes from being an embedded reporter in a war zone to sitting in the control room during Will\u2019s show, where she regularly saves him from looking like an idiot on national TV. Maggie volunteers to report from a war-torn region of Africa and narrowly avoids being killed. Sloan Sabbith holds a PhD, goes toe-to-toe with the president of the news division, punches Wall Street jerks, speaks fluent Japanese, and stands up for what she thinks is right, even when it means physically threatening her executive producer. Leona Lansing owns the network and, it\u2019s safe to say, scares the shit out of almost everyone, including her male subordinates.*\n\n>*The Newsroom is chuck-full of robust female characters. When faced with flawed women, we find ourselves utterly incapable of appreciating them for who they are as characters. Instead, we see them as universal representations of their gender, which means Sorkin doesn\u2019t have a \"woman problem.\" We do.*\n\n>*Feminism, as a movement, constantly begs Hollywood to depict, \"real\" female characters. We refuse to accept the overly sexualized \"hero\" like Cat Woman or the sexless, overworked bitch like Miranda Priestly. We\u2019re starving for smart, funny, flawed female characters who, if they don\u2019t actually \"have it all,\" are struggling to get there like the rest of us. But, when we actually see those characters on TV, we immediately complain about what we said we wanted all along \u2014 we turn on the writers of those shows for not crafting the \"perfect\" female character.*", "created_utc": 1542343367.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e9spw32", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_9xgzny", "parent_id": "t1_e9sikop", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/9xgzny/david_fincher_should_make_a_sequel_to_2010s_the/e9spw32/", "score": 28, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "magus678", "author_id": "ffrc0", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Tell that to Allison Janney's 4 emmys.", "created_utc": 1542341816.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e9socja", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_9xgzny", "parent_id": "t1_e9sikop", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/9xgzny/david_fincher_should_make_a_sequel_to_2010s_the/e9socja/", "score": 44, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "CheezWhizard", "author_id": "6jche", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Oh god I know how many people love The Newsroom but if you watch it and just focus on how incompetent and helpless the women are it just seems so ridiculous.

Even when it was airing, people complained that it was an unrealistic liberal fantasy, and that opinion has gotten stronger and more negative. By the time Sorkin left it was already so dominant that they tried to make it more \"gritty\" - and only ended up with the same complaints *plus* fans who found the \"grittiness\" predictable and uninteresting. Sorkin eventually tried to meet the same criticisms too with the Newsroom, to largely the same reception.\n\nIt's a rock and a hard place. It's either unrealistic and politically naive or it loses exactly the tone and arc that made the original so appealing.\n\nPlus I think it'd get a lot less leeway for its legitimate weaknesses today. The writing of some of the female characters and of the male characters' attitude towards them is already pretty infamous among fans. Opinions might differ (although I think you'd be hard-pressed to find someone who didn't think the condescending \"these women\" speech was anything less than cringe inducing), but social media would make the negative opinions a way bigger deal than they were at the time.\n\nThe West Wing worked because for the most part everyone knew it was a fantasy, knew that it was a story where the \"good guys\" were set up for you to root for them and to mostly do the right thing and often find solutions.\n\nChange that, and it doesn't really work as well, just like post-Sorkin West Wing and the Newsroom.\n\nBut without changing that, I don't think that suspension of disbelief could survive in the era of social media hot takes. It was fine when an occasional columnist would complain. It was easy to ignore your friend Steve's complaints about the show. It's less easy to ignore when the entire internet is looking to spread their hot take on why the popular, well-produced show is bad and why only rubes like it.
