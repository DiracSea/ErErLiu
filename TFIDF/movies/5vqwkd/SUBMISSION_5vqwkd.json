I cant think of what would have been enhanced if watched in 3D. those movies look beautiful and perfect in 2D.\nthose are two huge action movies and they are both being praised. Also they will both make alot of Money ( i hope so ) So my hope is, this starts a trend.\n\nEDIT: since a lot of people are telling me \"just watch it in 2D then, no one is forcing you\" I live in germany and the theatre that I go to ( which i own a membercard to ) has all the showings in 3D until 2-3 weeks after the movie came out. maybe it will have a 2D showing once per day, but that will be like at noon on a monday or something.\n\nEDIT2: saw Logan at the Berlinale Film Festival, for all of you wondering.", "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "title": "a cheer for 'Logan' and 'John Wick 2' for NOT being in 3D!", "url": null, "author_name": "djawesome361", "author_id": "j8xvl", "subreddit_name": "movies", "upvote_ratio": 0.79}
