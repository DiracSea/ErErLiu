He was so high in fact that he achieved the same status as Angels before his fall after refusing to bow before Adam (The 1st Man) as all other Angels were commanded to do by God, in Heaven (Paradise/Janna). It was basically racism. Due to arrogance and pride, He complained why should he bow down to a lesser creature since he was made of fire while Adam was made from clay. And due to his disobedience, he was commanded to the Hellfire. But he made a request (prayer if you will) to God before his eternal refuge in Hell, to delay his punishment until the end of Time so that he may attack Mankind from all directions on God's \"Straight Path\" and show God that they are not grateful nor obedient to God's Will. He was granted his request and on the Day of Judgement, when Mankind goes to blame Satan for their grave sins, he will reply \"I but merely whispered, you did the actions\". Just a short taste into his story guys. Sorry to get all theological on y'all. Forgive me if I came across as preachy, that's not my intent.

You can draw a good parallel between Satanism and Christianity in that both are groups of different sects that have major and minor differences between them.\n\nThe two biggest Satanist sects are the Church of Satan (also called LeVeyan Satanism after the founder) and the Satanic Temple.  There is a good amount of discord between the two, due to The Satanic Temple's political activism.\n\nThe movie above is reguarding The Satanic Temple.  The Satanic Temple loves to get political in order to show off hypocracy.  Their political stunts often go in the direction of things such as \"If you're going to have a nativity scene on public ground than we demand you also have a statue of Baphomet, as the state cannot show off icons from one religion and exclude others.\"  Or [Distrubing \"The Satanic Children's BIG BOOK of Activites (pdf)](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/religionwiki/images/b/b5/The_Satanic_Children%27s_BIG_BOOK_of_Activities.pdf/revision/latest?cb=20140920231451) at schools where other religious groups are handing out holy books.  The above stunt is one of the areas where discord between the two big groups source from, as The Church of Satan has the believe that children should not be indoctrinated in any religion.\n\n>From skimming the satanic bible, it does seem like more of a religion/philosophy than a political thing. I see them in the news a lot doing activism though, so it\u2019s a little confusing whether these are really the same groups.\n\nThe Satanic Bible is from The Church of Satan, which is not the politically active group.\n\nOf course there is nothing stopping anyone from starting a Satanic religion that's more in tune with what people would expect from a religion bearing the name of Satan.  There are also other less-mainstream sects, and those who would call themselves a Satanist but don't belong to either the Church or Temple due to personal issues with some of the messages.", "created_utc": 1549228305.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "efojljt", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_amr7kt", "parent_id": "t1_efodt26", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/amr7kt/first_poster_for_documentary_hail_satan_traces/efojljt/", "score": 8, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "MuNot", "author_id": "eo08d", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "From the Church of Satan website about [The Satanic Temple](https://www.churchofsatan.com/the-satanic-temple-fact-sheet/) \n\nThe Church of Satan [F.A.Q.](https://www.churchofsatan.com/frequently-asked-questions/) \n \nThe Satanic Temple [F.A.Q.](https://thesatanictemple.com/pages/faq) \n", "created_utc": 1549224206.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "efoe66j", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_amr7kt", "parent_id": "t1_efodt26", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/amr7kt/first_poster_for_documentary_hail_satan_traces/efoe66j/", "score": 9, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "UglyFatTroll", "author_id": "w0ovo", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Yeah, TST is basically a more organized and politically aggressive FSM ", "created_utc": 1549235616.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1549239627.0, "id": "efost1v", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_amr7kt", "parent_id": "t1_efoj0d6", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/amr7kt/first_poster_for_documentary_hail_satan_traces/efost1v/", "score": 5, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "iamagainstit", "author_id": "4cdh5", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Or in secret to divert attention.", "created_utc": 1549221493.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "efoall3", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_amr7kt", "parent_id": "t1_efo2a6q", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/amr7kt/first_poster_for_documentary_hail_satan_traces/efoall3/", "score": 201, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "JohnnyRelentless", "author_id": "6r67j", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "But TST is completely open about everything.

This statement, taken from the TST's FAQ, is a great way of underscoring that, while the COS claims to be independant of sprirtual thought, LeVeyan Satanism never actually closed that door:\n\n\n>HOW DOES TST\u2019S SATANISM DIFFER FROM LAVEYAN SATANISM?\nTST has its own guiding principles and tenets, distinct from the LaVeyan school, that we feel represents a natural evolution in Satanic thought. The overriding principle calls for utilizing the best scientific evidence available to make the most rational real-world decisions. To that end, we reject LaVeyan social Darwinist rhetoric that fails to agree with what is currently known regarding social evolution, specifically as it relates to research in evolutionary biology, game theory, reciprocal altruism, cognitive science, etc.\n\n>TST also strongly rejects the LaVeyan fetishization of authoritarianism. We believe this is antithetical to Satanic notions of individual sovereignty. Further, while LaVeyan Satanism is atheistic in that it rejects the notion that Satan is a conscious entity, it nevertheless adheres to supernaturalism. TST does not forward supernatural theories of the universe and finds little value in LaVeyan edicts such as those that instruct one to \u201cacknowledge the power of magic if you have employed it successfully to obtain your desires. If you deny the power of magic after having called upon it with success, you will lose all you have obtained.\u201d (From the Eleven Satanic Rules of the Earth, Anton LaVey)\n\n\nIn this thread, and in the COS FAQ link above, there is the call out of the vague theistic roots of the TST.  I have been an engaged member (in so far as that actually means something) since 2015...based a LOT on the above statement and it's cousins.  I identify as LeVeyan at my core, as I believe that LeVey's writings were important to my development as a mature atheist...but I'm an adult, and have no more interest in satan themed orgies then I do in magic.  Thus, the tenents of the TST more accurately describe who I am as conscious human.
