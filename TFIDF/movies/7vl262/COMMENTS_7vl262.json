Stage actors spend their careers being taught to project- to play to the back of the house- with both their voice and with their gestures. You cannot be subtle on most stages or it just won\u2019t read to the audience. \n\nThis makes for a very grand, over the top style of acting. When film became a thing, most of these new movie stars had learned how to act on a stage and so in a lot of older films the actors look a bit like caricatures to us now. Film is so much more up close and personal; a single eyebrow raise or jaw clench or a little hum can tell you so much about the character, their relationships etc., so much that would just not have been easy to convey on the stage. \n\nHowever it seems like most actors and a lot of filmmakers took a long time to catch up to this new sort of era of subtlety and realism that the nature of film allowed, and continued in this very over the top, over enunciated, over gestured way. As far as the filmmaking side goes, you\u2019ll see so many older films that were shot as if it was a play being performed on a stage- one or two camera angles, from the audience point of view (a lot like today\u2019s sitcoms). \n\n\nSo many older films turn me off for this reason, even though I actually really love theater (both acting and watching). It\u2019s because I see them as two distinct mediums I guess, that *generally* (not always) don\u2019t do well when mixed. When you go and see a play, no you don\u2019t get to see all the subtleties of the face and body (unless you\u2019re extremely close) but you get strong commanding performances that show off the actor\u2019s ability as a *performer,* and more importantly you get live energy- everyone in the room, actors and audience, are all part of this thing together. As a stage actor (*very* small time) I know how much the audience matters on any given night- you feed off their energy, what they\u2019re laughing at, how they\u2019re reacting, and you find yourself giving some line reads/interpretations you\u2019ve never even thought to give in all your time rehearsing, but it just clicks right then and it\u2019s all happening right there in the moment. It\u2019s just dynamic and exhilarating for both sides. \n\nWith a film you obviously don\u2019t get any of that raw energy, that interaction, so when a film is shot and acted in the style of a play it often falls very flat; but on the other hand, what you do get (when it is used to its potential) is that close up subtlety and realism, like the actor is not performing *for you* but rather *you\u2019ve* been sort of dropped in to secretly watch their life, from all angles, wherever they go. And that\u2019s amazing too. \n\nA good example of two productions that have completely embraced all that their respective mediums offer is if you watch Ruthie Henshall\u2019s stage performance of \u201cI Dreamed a Dream\u201d in Les Miserables and compare it to Anne Hathaway\u2019s in the recent film. They are both *seriously* amazing but in completely different ways, and both performances would likely fall flat if transplanted into the other medium. \n\n\nDo any of you know of some good early movies that really embrace the film format? Or even some stage-y type movies that are super good anyway?

The quality will be really good. The youtube versions often don't let you see the actors' faces or any of the crucial details. Your time would be effectively wasted with those.\n\nI learned it the hard way by watching a youtube version of Les Vampire and Intolerance, and only afterwards learned about the issue.
