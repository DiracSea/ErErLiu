And it's very common to create specific requirements for a cast (like nationality) if the setting, tone, or atmosphere demands it. \n\nPlus the nature of the American film industry is different to the British film industry because of scale. The American film industry is colossal and has an enormous range of films and stories set within its borders, as well as acting roles available. The British film industry, despite being the largest in Europe, is smaller and most of its big films are collaborations with European or North American countries. The British film industry is more protective with British franchises and brands, because it needs to be, just as the French industry is, or the Italian one. Partly because it secures roles for British/French/Italian actors, which are fewer than the roles available for American actors, and partly because of the national identity aspect. All of these countries have media industries which are as old as America's and equally as experienced, but not as large. The US puts out by far the most media and it can sometimes be overwhelming for other countries. There's a reason many films put quotas on the percentage of films which must come from their own countries - to support their own industries and stop the US industry from overwhelming them. And it's also why it is pivotal to the identity of British pop culture that James Bond, Harry Potter, Doctor Who, and Sherlock Holmes are British through and through. If this protective culture did not exist, each and every one of those franchises would be Americanised within the year. And when a British franchise or story is Americanised (recently we had The Girl on The Train moved from London to New York, with an all American cast), it creates an uproar because fans feel that a thing they love has been taken from their national culture and transplanted somewhere else because there's more money on offer. But when the opposite happens (like in Man of Steel or Lincoln), no one tends to care, because the US media industry is not protective in the same way, because it is so large that it does not need to be.
