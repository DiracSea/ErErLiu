When I went down on the border I stopped in a cafe in this town and there were some men in there drinking beer and one of them kept looking back at me. I didnt pay any attention to him. I ordered my dinner and ate. But when I walked up to the counter to pay the check I had to go past them and they were all grinning and he said something that was hard to ignore.

I was just standing there picking my teeth with a toothpick and I gave him a little gesture with my head. For him to come outside. If he would like to. And then I went out. And I waited in the parking lot. And he and his friends came out and I killed him in the parking lot and then I got into my car. They were all gathered around him. They didnt know what had happened. They didnt know that he was dead. One of them said that I had put a sleeper hold on him and then the others all said that. They were trying to get him to sit up. They were slapping him and trying to get him to sit up. An hour later I was pulled over by a sheriff's deputy outside of Sonora Texas and I let him take me into town in handcuffs.

In addition, the conversation of chigurh and Carla Jean is expanded and gives an extremely interesting look into his mind.  Where the chigurh of the movie is inpenatrable, the one in the book is a little slightly less so, but equally scary.  I find his way of thinking to be extremely interesting and that part gives a little better understanding to what he is saying in many conversations.\n\nWhat's just as important as showing what happened to Chigurh's, is that there is more of an explanation of why Bell retires.  Much of that is not actually at the end, though.  There is a portion where he talks about his service in WWII, and that he feels like a coward for not dying with his squadmates.  He also more clearly has a chance to face Chirgurh at the model after lewellyn's death, and doesn't.  You draw that together with him not dying on the force like his dad and other elements, and you it makes more of a complete picture.  While almost all of what he did is understand and maybe even right, he feels outmatched and that he is facing an evil he can't even understand.  He find himself unable to go out there and put his life on the line, even though he feels it is his duty almost to the point of feeling as though he SHOULD give his life.  So.  He retires.", "created_utc": 1512859043.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dr0ihlg", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7inpwk", "parent_id": "t1_dr0b82x", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7inpwk/no_country_for_old_mens_anton_chigurh_is_still_an/dr0ihlg/", "score": 12, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "sdrawkcabsemanympleh", "author_id": "7dlof", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "https://www.avclub.com/book-vs-film-no-country-for-old-men-1798213032", "created_utc": 1512851126.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dr0cclz", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7inpwk", "parent_id": "t1_dr0b82x", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7inpwk/no_country_for_old_mens_anton_chigurh_is_still_an/dr0cclz/", "score": 3, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "This is my rifle.
