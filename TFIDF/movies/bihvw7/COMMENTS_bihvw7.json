[{"body": "**Films on follow list with updates**\n\n* **Hellboy (2019) -** Well when there's a winner, there's often a loser and here he is ladies and gentlemen. As I predicted last week, it was a race for who would drop more theaters this weekend between this and the film discussed below, but ultimately Hellboy 'won' as it dropped 2,376 theaters, the 11th biggest drop in theaters in history. That gave it a massive 91% drop in box office from last week earning just $355K in its third weekend. The film already had a horrendous drop last weekend when it was forced to stay in theaters due to the usual two weekend mandated clauses every wide release film has. But theaters had free rein this weekend and when your choice was Big Red or Big Purple, people made their choice and Red got the boot.\n* **Captain Marvel** \\- I wondered last weekend how the effect of the massive Endgame opening would effect Captain Marvel and it seems pretty damn well. The film jumped back up to #2 with $8M,  an 11.6% drop from last weekend. Clearly people still had homework to do or felt Captain Marvel's role in Endgame was so important you had to see the other movie. This marks a pretty crazy moment when both the #1 and #2 films at the box office are of the same franchise. If you hate the MCU, my sincere sorrow for you as cinema has now been officially eaten by it. \n\n**Films not on follow list with updates**\n\n* **Missing Link -** Well Missing Link did a little better than Hellboy but the race for the bottom is not a fun race at all as the film dropped 1,849 theaters, the 69th (nice) biggest theater drop ever. That's a 77% drop from last weekend but shockingly it almost made $1M, coming in with $950K for the weekend. I think it's become clear that there actually was somewhat of an audience for the film, but the terrible marketing and placement just doomed the thing. Netflix, please save Laika. The shoe money can only last so long...oh what's that? Nike makes the budget of Missing Link every microsecond? Okay never mind Netflix, we're good here!\n\n**Notable film closings**\n\n* **Bohemian Rhapsody -** The absolutely insane run of BR has finally come to an end as the film closes this week to a massive $216.4M domestic and $902.2M worldwide on a budget of $52M. The film had every possible excuse to be a massive failure. So many controversies plagued this film: the fallout over the initial choice of lead actor, the way the film dealt with Mercury's queerness, the fights over editing with the band, the fights over directors, and the devastating Atlantic article that revealed the film was in fact directed by Bryan Singer (kinda). After all that and the middling critic reviews this film felt sunk but goddamn it don't count out people's love of Queen and a fun time at the movies because good lord this film would not die. The fact it became the first music biopic to cross $200M domestic is crazy enough, but the $900M worldwide is the really insane part. While sadly that is due in part to the de-queering of the film for many markets including China, it was a truly unstoppable force walking away with 4 Oscars and a record that will be hard to beat. It will be interesting to see how Rocketman will fare in comparison but goddamn is this just one of the most surprising massive hits in my many years writing this column.", "created_utc": 1556496763.0, "distinguished": "moderator", "edited": 1556555726.0, "id": "em0rg7t", "is_submitter": true, "link_id": "t3_bihvw7", "parent_id": "t3_bihvw7", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/bihvw7/box_office_week_avengers_endgame_tops_the_all/em0rg7t/", "score": 1, "stickied": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "mi-16evil", "author_id": "4vrqm", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Oh boy, Hellboy really got fucked, didn't it?

You don't judge a silly comedy for how compelling its story is.  You don't judge a dark drama based on how funny it is.
