Looking back on my childhood, it seems like we were always together and were always spending our time at the township pool, playing in our backyards, riding our bikes to get ice cream, playing video games, and finding a way to extend our time together for as long as possible until our moms called us home for dinner or when it started to get dark outside. I never thought that those days would end and I never wanted them to. Even now, I feel like those were the happiest days of my life. Well, we all know that nothing lasts forever and that we all have to grow up sometime. I guess I just wasn't looking forward to it as much as my friends were when we were 14. \n\nEvery summer, nearly every person where I live makes their way to the beach for as long as they can for vacation. My friends and I always looked forward to these times because we loved swimming in the ocean and playing whiffle ball on the sand, going down to the arcades and blowing our money on dozens of games, and of course we loved going on as many amusement park rides as possible on the boardwalk while stuffing our faces with cotton candy and ice cream until we practically hurled from it all. It was the summer before high school and by that August when we were all at the beach for a few days, I felt like I was having the best summer of my life. June and July had been so much fun and I made so many lasting and unforgettable memories with my friends by the time that August rolled around and we all headed to the beach with our families for what was usually the \"last hurrah\" of our summer vacation. \n\nFor some reason, my friends told me that they didn't want to play basketball at the park one night like we always used to do and instead they wanted to go up to the boardwalk. I was confused because for years we had always played hoops whenever we could and went to the boardwalk to go on the rides and to play video games. I figured that we would be partaking in the latter activities until my friend Joe said \"Oh yeah, wear khaki shorts and a polo.\" I wasn't sure why I needed to get \"dressed up\" to play arcade games and go on rides but I said \"Alright, whatever\" and showed up that night to meet my friends on the boardwalk with the nicest clothes that I could wear that I had bought from PacSun that summer. \n\nI got to the boardwalk and saw my friends standing around, looking like they were all dressed for a date or something. We all then started walking along the boards and I tagged along, unsure of where we were going. We walked for a few minutes until my friends spotted a group of teenage girls and guys our age who were all posted up along the railings and on benches looking out near the ocean. My friends stopped walking and did the same and started sizing up the guys and ogling the girls wearing their flip-flops, shorts, and spaghetti strap tops. I just sat there, not saying a word, while my friends started talking about which girls they wanted to talk to, who they wanted to \"get with\", and what they were going to say to \"get to first base\" with the girls. None of them really knew what to do so we ended up sitting on that bench for twenty minutes until we saw that group of guys and girls start to walk away from us down the boards. All of a sudden, two drunk blonde girls with cigarettes and red Solo cups loudly announced their presence to us by stumbling up the boards from behind us and yelling unintelligible things at us. They must have been in high school, probably around 16 or so by the looks of it. My friends didn't miss a beat and raced up to them to start talking to them but the girls weren't interested in talking. They immediately started sloppily making out with all five of my friends while I stood off in the distance and watched it all unfold, unable to move. Their sloppy kissing only lasted about thirty seconds but that was all my buddies needed. By the time the girls stumbled away from them my friends were celebrating like they had just hit the lottery. I didn't feel so lucky or so happy. \n\nAs we walked back to our beach houses, hooting and hollering about making out with those girls, my friend Bobby noticed that I was lagging behind the rest of the group and wasn't saying anything. He dropped back from the other guys and said to me \"It's alright man, you'll get some next time\" and then returned to my group of friends ahead of me. Bobby thought that I was upset and quiet because I didn't get to hook up with those drunk girls or with those other girls that we ogled for about twenty minutes on the boards that night. I wasn't upset about not hooking up. I was upset because in that moment, on that night, I realized that the part of my childhood that made me so happy and that meant more than anything to me was gone. Where my friends were now thinking about girls and were going through the teenage experience of thinking about them sexually and romantically nearly 24/7, I was still thinking and dreaming about days at the pool, riding bikes around town, playing whiffle ball in our backyards, and of days that resembled more of the life lived in *The Sandlot* before Squints put the moves on a certain Wendy Peffercorn. While I was stuck thinking about all of that, my friends had grown up right before my eyes and had left behind that part of our friendship and were longingly and excitingly eyeing up the next phase of our lives as teenagers leaving behind \"kid stuff\" and heading to high school.\n\nLooking back on it now, I guess I just wasn't ready for things to be over so fast. Time flies when you're having fun and boy did it fly for me in those days and years that I spent with my friends as a kid. As it flew by, I guess I missed the part where we all grew up that little bit more. That walk back from the boardwalk that night is one I'll never forget. It's rare that you can remember and locate a place and time in your life where everything seemed to change in the blink of an eye. I still miss the times we had together as middle school boys. I'll never forget them. I'll never forget the night I lost my childhood innocence with my best friends.\n\n*\"I never had any friends later on like the ones I had when I was 14.

I lived in a rough area during a rough time. I lost many childhood friends to drug overdoses, prison, suicide, and general street violence of various sorts. Somehow, a small handful of us managed to make it thru to midlife. The sad part is that we seem to stay away from getting together because its more painful to see that its only 3 or 4 of us left as opposed to the 12 or 15 tight friends we had growing up. Its not a great time reminiscing when 75% of the stories are about the friends we cant be with. So we drift apart and stay that way and technology now makes it so much easier to stay in touch while keeping our distance. I will never have friends like those kids again, but i dont think i ever want to. Ill enjoy the friendships i have for what they are but they will never be the same as those in my childhood.
