If a superhero has any loose clothing, the artist often draws it to be as flattering to the figure as possible, rather than accurate to their movement or environment. The only source of clear movement in their clothing is usually a cape.\n\nDrawn costumes can also defy logic more easily without the reader noticing. Such things as Batman having a manageable cape while running in one panel and a long cape ominously enveloping his body in another.\n\nLive-action media can't utilise these artistic perks. Designers have to find a compromise between accuracy and functionality. They also have to consider the actor.

There was zero gratuitous actor facial shots. \n\nDaredevil on Netflix has a mask on a lot of the time; only exception is the final fight.

He fought as TChalla, but as Panther, helmet was always on unless he needed to talk as King/person and not a Warrior.
