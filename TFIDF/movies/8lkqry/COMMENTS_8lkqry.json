The nature of content is changing. 20 years ago you could mostly keep up with the big-name content, there wasn't a massive amount of it. These days that's impossible, there's a ton of big-name content being produced, there just aren't enough hours in a day to keep up.\n\nThis isn't a problem per se, but it changes the game. Everyone can kind of carve out a more niche corner of content to watch. That means less overlap with other people, and the amount of new content being created is so large that it's not like the 90's where you'd keep movies on VHS and rewatch them when you were bored.\n\nSo, will anyone be watching the movies Netflix is making today, in 5 years? One of the draws of them having a back catalog of older movies (which has been eroded due to content deals) was that people could watch movies they were nostalgic for, ones that you couldn't easily rent and didn't have enough pull to find online and buy and ship. Is anyone going to be nostalgic for the current breed of Netflix movies when there's so much new content being created, and there's going to be less nostalgic overlap. When there's a flood of content it's not going to be \"Hey, remember that movie XYZ, one of only like 50 big name movies that came out in 1996?\"\n\nDirectors like Scorsese will bemoan that we're creating throwaway content and devaluing the art, and in a lot of cases we probably are, but it'll be interesting how this changes the economics of it all.
