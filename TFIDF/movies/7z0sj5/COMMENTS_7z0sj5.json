For sure, our team is working closely with Paramount and Machinima regarding the next chapter and the product lines associated with that. No decision is made independently from film partners, so we are part of this conversation on what\u2019s next and when should we deliver the next thing. Our attention right now is to focus on Bumblebee [The Movie]. I think the film has come along great. We\u2019ve seen a lot of footage, cuts, takes. Toyline looks fantastic. I think there is a lot of directions we could take, post that. There are toy concepts we are working on. Nothing stops us. You guys saw downstairs, right?  We have Cyberverse cranking. That\u2019s coming out soon. We have Studio Series, we have Bumblebee film toyline, for Generations a new trilogy announced. Any shifts, we have to deal with it.  Either pause or  just charge head-on. This is one where we are going to collectively pause, sow for what\u2019s the next best story is and then put a toyline around that. In no way that it distracts us.\n\nSource: http://news.tfw2005.com/2018/02/18/john-warden-comments-transformers-movie-franchise-future-359410\n\nTaking *Transformers 6* off the slate ties in with the idea that Hasbro and Paramount are going to 'pause' to consider their next move, but it doesn't confirm the 'reboot' that people have been talking about.

In this new universe, Unicron and Cybertron are the same thing -- Unicron is a transformer that has managed to merge with Cybertron, becoming a planet sized intelligence.  The Autobots are a rogue group of Transformers lead by Optimus Prime who stole the All Spark and trapped Cybertron in Subspace in order to save the galaxy from Unicron's plans of galactic conquest.  The Decepticons are Unicron's Secret Police, lead by his lieutenant Megatron.  The Autobots escape to Earth, arriving in the Jurassic age (or whenever T-Rexes were around), then go into hibernation.  The Decepticons follow them -- Unicron needs the All Spark to escape Subspace -- but making the shift from Subspace to real space means the Decepticons arrive *millions* of years after the Autobots, who have been long buried in the badlands of Wyoming.\n\nIn this movie, Megatron will manage to gain control of the All Spark, reveal his intentions to use it to destroy Unicron and rule the world, and will then be defeated when his own lieutenant, STARSCREAM, betrays him and tries to get the All Spark for himself, giving Optimus the opening to save the day.\n\nThe military will naturally show up at some point in the movie, so use that opportunity to introduce Sgt. Conrad Hauser as the leader of a Special Forces strike team that gets slaughtered by the Decepticons.\n\nThen in a post-credit scene, Hauser is being debriefed by his superiors and he tells them \"We aren't prepared for these kinds of threats. We need something different, an elite fighting force hand picked for missions far outside normal parameters.\"  His superiors agree, and we see his commander holding a folder labeled \"Operation: GI JOE\" as they tell Hauser they want him to lead a new unit they are forming.  Hauser, of course, is DUKE's real name.\n\nNext, a GI JOE movie.  COBRA has captured the \"corpse\" of a dead Decepticon and used it to create a weapon fabricator that can pump out jets, tanks, etc.  GI JOE has to stop COBRA from taking over a large portion of Eastern Europe or the like.\n\nThen spin off a M.A.S.K. movie from GI JOE, with M.A.S.K. being a secret offshoot of the Joes program using technology developed from Transformers to create transforming vehicles, with V.E.N.OM. being a rogue COBRA cell.\n\nThen you do huge event movie where the Transformers, GI Joes, and M.A.S.K. team-up to battle the combined forces of the Decepticons (now being lead by SHOCKWAVE, who followed slightly after Megatron in a second ship), COBRA and V.E.N.O.M., with COBRA and V.E.N.O.M. being manipulated by Shockwave into helping them create a Subspace Signal that will allow Unicron to shift Cybertron into Earth's orbit.", "created_utc": 1519188767.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "dukzhx9", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7z0sj5", "parent_id": "t3_7z0sj5", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7z0sj5/paramount_drops_transformers_6_from_its_slate/dukzhx9/", "score": 43, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": null, "author_id": null, "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "They made FIVE of those movies???

Before that it was Hugo Weaving, who played Agent Smith in the Matrix series. Welker was also the original voice actor of Soundwave and reprised that role for a cameo in whatever film it was that Soundwave (he was a satellite orbiting Earth) first appeared. There's been a few others along the way. Welker has contributed to the series pretty much from the start but wasn't given the role of Megatron at the very beginning for some reason. The first in a long line of mistakes to come.\n\nAnd I'll agree. The voice acting was good, even great in spots. The visuals were amazing at times. Everything else about the movies, especially the last 2 were pure garbage. The direction was terrible. The script was terrible. The plot made no sense and was full of holes. The pacing was awful. The acting was passable for the most part but cringey at its worst times. \n\nThe first movie was fine for what it was. Actually enjoyable. But by the end of the first movie, it was clear that there was no rules in this universe: \n\nBumblebee couldn't talk at the beginning but then inexplicably could talk at the end of the first movie only to inexplicably been unable to talk again when the second movie started. \n\nA fresh batch of Autobots and Decepticons magically show up for each new movie. No explanation about how they got there. Just floating around in space, I guess. \n\nSceneries change with no logic or explanation. The aircraft museum in the second movie opens up to an expansive, dry field with tons of old airplanes. Despite the fact that its in fucking Washington DC. Seriously, Google Maps the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum and see if you can find a giant, arid patch of land full of old airplanes in the middle of the National Mall. \n\nDead transformers can come back to life with very little effort or very little explanation. Seriously, how many times does Megatron have to die or otherwise look like a bitch in this series. \n\nThen there was that time at the beginning of the 4th movie where they found Optimus Prime in an abandoned garage and he needed to get back to his Autobots so that they could fix him. A chase scene ensues and along the way Prime simply scans a new truck and all of the sudden he is completely restored. Like, what the hell. Why didn't he just do that in the first place. What did he need his Autobots for?\n\nMichael Bay is a shitty director who makes shitty movies and mistakenly believes that the audience is dumber than him. At this point, I'm pretty sure he knows how bad he is and his goal with the visuals and the explosions is to try and distract the viewer from seeing how bad the movies are. It would probably have a chance to work if the story was at least logical and could be kept under 2 hours. Instead he gives us nearly 3 hour, poorly paced shitfests that make the flaws impossible to ignore. You're already exhausted from watching the atrocities but there is still a whole hour to go. You spend the entire last hour of the movie asking yourself \"what the fuck is going on here\" and \"when is this shit over with\".\n\nAnd I'm a Transformers nerd who got a little teary-eyed the first time I heard Peter Cullen's voice in the first movie back in 2007.", "created_utc": 1519188543.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1519189014.0, "id": "dukzbw1", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7z0sj5", "parent_id": "t1_dukvuwp", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7z0sj5/paramount_drops_transformers_6_from_its_slate/dukzbw1/", "score": 44, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "joesaysso", "author_id": "aovvn", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Megan Fox did hold my attention through the movies pretty well though", "created_utc": 1519187098.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "duky678", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7z0sj5", "parent_id": "t1_dukvuwp", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7z0sj5/paramount_drops_transformers_6_from_its_slate/duky678/", "score": 6, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Bauerbakshi", "author_id": "pzxoa", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Actually skipped the title to go straight to your comment and I also happen to like the FF movies. \n\nwelp:(", "created_utc": 1519180713.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1519216217.0, "id": "duksk2e", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7z0sj5", "parent_id": "t1_duks507", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7z0sj5/paramount_drops_transformers_6_from_its_slate/duksk2e/", "score": 91, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "jughead0", "author_id": "lccqj", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "The transsexual serial killers stalking your kids the mainstream media is afraid to talk about!
