The movie paid many homages to the original franchises and took their respective monsters faithfully to the core. Perhaps the weakest part of the movie was the humans, with not so stellar performances but AvP is akin to FvJ. For example:\n\n\u2022 the opening shot of the Weyland satellite resembles the Alien Queen\u2019s skull, giving you a false start on where the movie is. \n\n\u2022 Weyland is (for the movie at least) the founder of Weyland Enterprises which the android Bishop was modeled after. \n\n\u2022 the opening sequence for the Predator ship, mimics the launch sequence from Alien where the space helmets act like pilots to the ship, now with the Predator helmets. \n\n\u2022 The sacrificial chamber in the pyramid is the same design as the sleeping pods in Alien. \n\n\u2022 Both the Alien and the Predator are presented as unstoppable forces that are hunting the humans. They couldn\u2019t do anything against any of them. They didn\u2019t kill any Predator and I Think they didn\u2019t kill an Alien either. \n\n\u2022 The story is taken straight from the first AvP comic series where a human colony in the planet Ryushi, or something like that, encounters and Alien Queen that has been planted there by the Predators to use as hunting grounds. \n\n\u2022 There is even a human-Predator alliance in the comic, branding her with the symbol of the clan, like in the movie. \n\n\u2022 They introduced in this movie the concept of bigger and more powerful plasmacasters. \n\n\u2022 Again, they showed multiple visions from the Predator helmets. \n\n\u2022 They repeated the concept of honor between members of the clan, leaving the protagonist alive at the end. \n\n\u2022The design of the Queen is superb. It\u2019s the best look since Aliens. \n\n\u2022 They teased the coming of the Predalien, which again has appeared before in the comics and the video games. \n\n\u2022there is a shot of The protagonist that is very similar to a shot in Alien where Ripley\u2019s hand is seen coming from an air duct and then the camera focuses on her eyes. They are both almost identical, so it\u2019s another homage. \n\n\nPersonally, I think the music was great and the movie was pretty enjoyable. Of course it has its flaws and everything but I don\u2019t think it was disrespectful of the original franchises. \n\n", "created_utc": 1519494650.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "durk6no", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_7zwkiz", "parent_id": "t1_durc08s", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/7zwkiz/15_years_ago_they_actually_did_a_weighin_press/durk6no/", "score": 27, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "SirLeos", "author_id": "6jfp5", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "It could be because I am now watching the Unrated Edition, not the theatrical cut.
