Sure, I use it -- but I remember it being more like a neat bonus as a Prime subscriber thinking they were simply testing out their own standalone streaming service. \n\nI'm happy it became (with a price increase later, of course) part of a greater series of offerings and not an add-on or option. \n\nIt's quite strange though how when Prime was $79 a year, if you asked me if I would pay $20 more for great streaming music and video services even after having them \"free\" for a while, I'd have said no. Even more strange is how a lot of the stuff I used to buy from Amazon was physical movies and music -- a practice which has ceased in part because of their extended Prime offerings. \n\nNice move, Amazon.
