Quentin and I had an enormous fight, and I accused him of trying to kill me. And he was very angry at that, I guess understandably, because he didn\u2019t feel he had tried to kill me.\u201d", "created_utc": 1570086645.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "f299adp", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_dch55p", "parent_id": "t1_f2944qx", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/dch55p/canada_inquiry_finds_that_deadpool_2_producers/f299adp/", "score": 62, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "hhhthrewitaway", "author_id": "xhxhj", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I feel like this dude has some lampshades at home made of human skin.", "created_utc": 1570074804.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "f28z3ap", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_dch55p", "parent_id": "t1_f28srbh", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/dch55p/canada_inquiry_finds_that_deadpool_2_producers/f28z3ap/", "score": 36, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "dramasexual", "author_id": "1jqqtvd4", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Wow.
