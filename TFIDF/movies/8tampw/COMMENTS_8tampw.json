Every single scene has a very specific purpose, and the film moves almost too quickly if you are trying to find those nuances.\n\nFor example, the opening scene is ScarJo's butt in pink panties. Its clearly a statement about sexual attraction, but its used later in the film to provide exposition into her relationship with her husband. We see her in lots of underwear in the film, but aside from those pink ones her panties (like her wardrobe) is very drab. So why the pink ones?\n\nWell, there's a scene where her husband is on the floor, checking and packing his equipment before he leaves for work. He is squatting, and the camera is placed specifically at this head level. So ScarJo is simply walking around the bed, but both our vision and his is right there at underwear level. Her lower half throws this bright pink butt, already established as sexy in the opening shot, right across the middle of a shot that is other wise drab and dull colorfully. And then, we see this symbol of sexuality walk right past his head - he doesn't acknowledge it with his eyes, and he just keeps talking without missing a beat. Her sexuality, and what she was trying to communicate to him, was entirely wasted because she was invisible.\n\nThroughout the film, neither his wife nor her husband are portrayed as bad people. In fact, the affair the two main characters have may be the worst actions in either marriage that we see. Its something you have to look out for on every interaction - the perception that the main characters have about their marriages is not at all due to anyone being guilty.\n\nAnother subtle scene that I love, my favorite of the whole movie, is when they sit at the hotel bar towards the end and caress each other's hands. Murray says he wants to run away from life and stay there forever, something he has joked about all movie; she responds with a joke about starting a jazz band. Its not even fully in the shot, but he pulls his hand away from hers and to his face - he was frustrated by the joke. He didn't have the courage to be straight and ask her to stay, but that's what he was doing.\n\nHe claimed in the central scene of the film that 'life gets easier when you know what you want, because the bad stuff bothers you less.' He however spends the whole movie bothered and uncomfortable because he doesn't know what he's missing in his life, or how to go get it.", "created_utc": 1529778747.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e169mx6", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_8tampw", "parent_id": "t1_e166ljz", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/8tampw/her_2013_meets_lost_in_translation_2003/e169mx6/", "score": 104, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Bobby_Marks2", "author_id": "egwvt", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I definitely wouldn't call it **very, very, very** slow.

One of the main themes of the movie is Joaquin Phoenix's character struggling with that vulnerability.\n\nHe (and many of the audience that went to see it) seems to be able to open up to others, but not face to face. Only indirectly, where there's a buffer of some kind. He writes incredibly intimate letters, but they're for other people. He immerses himself in video games, but that doesn't involve other people. He even tries to find sex through non-direct ways, but only through the anonymity of whatever that sex-chatroulette thing was at the beginning.\n\nAll this because he's terrified of vulnerability, and having the people on the other end of that sex line be so \"weird\" only increases his fear of being vulnerable to any other people.\n\nThen he finds a way to be vulnerable to another person in a way that feels safe, his AI.

It also uses the original trilogy as a framing device for the prequel trilogy. Vader drops this huge bomb that he's Luke's father, then we spend two movies proving he's telling the truth, then we see how it gets resolved. When Empire first came out, lots of people thought Vader was lying to Luke. It wasn't \"proven\" true until Obi-Wan confirms it in Jedi, but then it's immediately followed by Obi-Wan's \"a certain point of view\" justification. Inserting the prequels turns this reveal into a \"show, don't tell\" situation - we don't just hear Obi-Wan say it, we see it.\n\n>With Machete Order, the Star Wars watching experience gets to start with the film that does the best job of establishing the Star Wars universe, Episode IV, and it ends with the most satisfying ending, Episode VI. It also starts the series off with the two strongest films, and allows you to never have to either start or end your viewing experience with a shitty movie. Two films of Luke's story, two films of Anakin's story, then a single film that intertwines and ends both stories.\n\n>Beyond this, Episode I establishes Anakin as a innocent little kid. But Episode II quickly establishes him as impulsive and power-hungry, which keeps his character consistent with eventually becoming Darth Vader. Obi-Wan never really seems to have any control over Anakin, struggling between treating him as a friend (their very first conversation together in Episode II) and treating him as an apprentice (their second conversation, with Padme). Anakin is never a carefree child yelling \"yippee\", he's a complex teenager nearly boiling over with rage in almost every scene. It makes much more sense for Anakin to have always been this way.\n>\n>In the opening of Episode II, Padme refers to Anakin as \"that little boy I knew on Tatooine.\" The two of them look ap\u00adprox\u00adi\u00admately the same age in Episode II, so the viewer can nat\u00adu\u00adrally con\u00adclude that the two of them were friends as chil\u00addren. This com\u00adpletely hides the totally weird age gap between them from Episode I, and lends a lot of be\u00adliev\u00adabil\u00adity to the sub\u00adse\u00adquent romance. Scenes in which they fall for each other seem to build on a child\u00adhood friend\u00adship that we never see but can assume is there. Since their re\u00adla\u00adtion\u00adship is the even\u00adtual reason for Anakin's fall to the dark side, having it be some\u00adwhat be\u00adliev\u00adable makes a big dif\u00adfer\u00adence.\n\n>Obi-Wan now always has a beard for the entire du\u00adra\u00adtion of the series, and Anakin Sky\u00adwalker always wears black. Since these two char\u00adac\u00adters are played by dif\u00adfer\u00adent actors (and are the only char\u00adac\u00adters in the series with such a dis\u00adtinc\u00adtion), having them look vi\u00adsu\u00adally con\u00adsis\u00adtent does a great deal toward re\u00adin\u00adforc\u00ading they are the same people.\n\n>Update: Den of Geek has also written up an article high\u00adlight\u00ading some more things that work better in Machete Order that I didn't mention. I par\u00adtic\u00adu\u00adlarly like the extra di\u00admen\u00adsion it gives Yoda.\n\n>What a Twist!\nThis order also pre\u00adserves all twists, and adds a new one (or rather, makes one more ef\u00adfec\u00adtive).\n\n>As men\u00adtioned, this order pre\u00adserves the sur\u00adprise that Darth Vader is Luke's father. For what it's worth, it also pre\u00adserves the sur\u00adprise that \"Yoda, the Jedi Master who trained [Obi-Wan]\" is the tiny green guy on Degobah. Both of these were sur\u00adprises for movie\u00adgo\u00aders at the time and, though it's some\u00adwhat un\u00adlikely that culture and cereal boxes and whatnot won't ruin these sur\u00adprises for someone, at the very least they aren't ruined by Machete Order.\n\n>George Lucas knew that watch\u00ading the films in Episode Order would remove the Vader and Yoda sur\u00adprises, so he added the Pal\u00adpa\u00adtine twist to com\u00adpen\u00adsate - that the friendly Senator Pal\u00adpa\u00adtine is ac\u00adtu\u00adally a Sith Lord and creates the Empire. Since we don't really meet the Emperor until Episode VI (you only see him for one scene, in holo\u00adgram, in V), this order pre\u00adserves the prequel's twist. This twist is ac\u00adtu\u00adally ruined by Episode I, which es\u00adtab\u00adlishes that Darth Sidious is ma\u00adnip\u00adu\u00adlat\u00ading the Trade Fed\u00ader\u00ada\u00adtion in the opening scene of the film, but he's on screen so much that it's pretty obvious Sidious is Pal\u00adpa\u00adtine when we see Pal\u00adpa\u00adtine later on.\n\n>If you skip Episode I and go straight to II, all we ever see is that Count Dooku is leading a sep\u00ada\u00adratist move\u00adment, all on his own. Dooku tells Obi-Wan that the Senate is under the control of a Sith lord named \"Darth Sidious\", who we haven't seen at all yet. At the end of the movie, after Dooku flees from Geono\u00adsis, he meets with his \"master\", who turns out to be Darth Sidious. This is the first time we realize that the sep\u00ada\u00adratist move\u00adment is ac\u00adtu\u00adally being con\u00adtrolled by Sidious, and it's so brief that it doesn't give the au\u00addi\u00adence as much of a chance to realize he's Pal\u00adpa\u00adtine (re\u00admem\u00adber, nobody has ever re\u00adferred to \"Emperor Pal\u00adpa\u00adtine\" by this point in the series, he's only called The Emperor in Episode V).\n\n>Below is the en\u00adtirety of Sidious's screen time in Episode II. With Machete Order, this is the only chance you have to realize that Chan\u00adcel\u00adlor Pal\u00adpa\u00adtine is behind every\u00adthing until he tries to recruit Anakin to the Dark Side in Episode III. Per\u00adson\u00adally I think it's still a bit of a give\u00adaway given Ian Mc\u00adDi\u00adarmid's creepy acting as Pal\u00adpa\u00adtine (plus the cleft chin), but at least kids have a chance at not re\u00adal\u00adiz\u00ading it too early this way.\n\n\n>Machete Order also keeps the fact that Luke and Leia are sib\u00adlings a sur\u00adprise, it simply moves the sur\u00adprise to Episode III instead of VI, when Padme an\u00adnounces her daugh\u00adter's name. This is ac\u00adtu\u00adally a more ef\u00adfec\u00adtive twist in this context than when Obi-Wan just tells Luke in Return of the Jedi. We get to find out before Luke, and we dis\u00adcover Padme's car\u00adry\u00ading twins along\u00adside Obi-Wan when the Gynobot tells him (a sur\u00adprise at this point). Luke's name is first, so when Padme names the other kid \"Leia\" it's a pretty shock\u00ading reveal. With Release Order, this \"twist\" happens when Yoda tells Luke there's another Sky\u00adwalker in Return of the Jedi, and Luke guesses it's Leia with Obi-Wan's ghost one scene later. With Episode Order, it's not a sur\u00adprise at all, as we have no idea who Luke and Leia are yet. As an added bonus, there are now about 5 hours of film between the dis\u00adcov\u00adery that they are sib\u00adlings and the time they kissed.\n\n>What Works Best?\nThe real value of Machete Order becomes clear when you watch Return of the Jedi.\n\n>Re\u00admem\u00adber, we see in Episode V that Luke's vision in the cave on Degobah is that he turns into Darth Vader, then we find out Vader is his father. Then we watch Episodes II and III, in which his father turns to the dark side in order to protect his loved ones. After that we go back to VI, where even\u00adtu\u00adally Luke con\u00adfronts the Emperor.\n\n>With Machete Order, we never saw Anakin as a little kid, he's about the same age the first time we see him as Luke was in Episode IV. Hayden Chris\u00adtensen's in\u00adces\u00adsant whining in Episode II is ac\u00adtu\u00adally less an\u00adnoy\u00ading now, because it's helping to link the char\u00adac\u00adter to Luke, who was just as whiny in Episode IV. In other words, because we skipped Episode I, the par\u00adal\u00adlels between Luke and Anakin are much stronger. We've seen Obi-Wan train just the two of them, and never had to see anyone train\u00ading Obi-Wan himself. The viewer is nat\u00adu\u00adrally linking the paths of these two char\u00adac\u00adters to\u00adgether at this point, moreso than if he or she watched Episode I.\n\n>The first time we see Luke in Return of the Jedi, he is en\u00adter\u00ading Jabba's palace and the musical cue sounds a bit like the Im\u00adpe\u00adr\u00adial March. The way he enters with the light behind him makes it unclear if he is Luke or Vader for a bit, and when we finally see him, he's wearing all black. Then, he force chokes Jabba's guards, some\u00adthing only Vader has done in the series! Nobody else sees him do this.\n\n\n>When he con\u00adfronts Jabba, he warns him that he's taking his friends back. He says Jabba can either profit from this, \"or be de\u00adstroyed.\" We just heard Anakin make a similar threat to Obi-Wan, \"don't make me destroy you.\" Fur\u00adther\u00admore, he tells Jabba \"not to un\u00adder\u00ades\u00adti\u00admate my power.\" The last time this phrase was used, it was in the same duel with Obi-Wan. When watch\u00ading Jedi on its own, Luke just seems a tad ar\u00adro\u00adgant during these scenes. When watch\u00ading Jedi im\u00adme\u00addi\u00adately after watch\u00ading Revenge of the Sith, the message is clear: Luke Sky\u00adwalker is on the path to the Dark Side.\n\n>Why does this matter? Because at the end of Jedi, Luke con\u00adfronts the Emperor. The Emperor ex\u00adplains that the assault on the new Death Star is a trap and that his friends are going to die, and he keeps taunt\u00ading Luke, telling him to grab his lightsaber and fight him. The film is trying to create a tension that Luke might embrace the Dark Side, but it was never really be\u00adliev\u00adable. However, within the context of him fol\u00adlow\u00ading in his father's foot\u00adsteps and his father using the power of the dark side to save people, with Luke's friends being killed just outside the Death Star window, this is much more be\u00adliev\u00adable.\n\n>Shortly after, Luke goes apeshit and beats the hell out of Vader, clearly suc\u00adcumb\u00ading to his anger. He over\u00adpow\u00aders Vader with rage and cuts his arm off, just like Anakin did to Windu in Episode III. Having the very real threat of Luke fol\u00adlow\u00ading in his father's path made clear by watch\u00ading II and III just before VI height\u00adens the tension of this scene, and it ac\u00adtu\u00adally makes Return of the Jedi better. Yes, watch\u00ading Revenge of the Sith just before Return of the Jedi makes it a better, more ef\u00adfec\u00adtive film.
