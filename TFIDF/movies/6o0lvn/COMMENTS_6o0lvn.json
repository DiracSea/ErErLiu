I'll try and do it justice a second time here. \n\nOh. \n\nMy. \n\nGod. \n\nThat was the greatest worst thing I've ever seen. Everything about it was god awful in the very best way possible. Like EVERYTHING was awful but somehow totally endearing. How is that even possible!? \n\nTommy sure has passion but my god he can't act, write or direct lol. You could hear his words come out of everyone else..and not in a good way (except it is). As the film went on I kept getting more amazed at how this is allowed to even exist haha. \n\nJohnny, for being such a 'super swell guy' is an unintentional dick when someone speaks to him. Pour your heart out? Well you're getting the shortest answer possible among with a \"haah, haah\" for your troubles lol. It's like he tried to make the nicest guy ever and in ways massively succeeded and in ways didn't. The laugh, the everything really was simply amazing. \n\nEVERYONE was so awkward. I really don't know how that's possible, that every single person in the film gives the impression that they just so happen to have cameras on them for when they've met other humans for the first time lol. That is an impressive thing to pull off. \n\nEvery kiss in the film was like a fish, it was as if all their first kisses ever filmed. \n\nI swear Laura was laughing/smiling during the majority of her scenes and I don't blame her, I wouldn't be able to hold back the laughter or tears if I was involved in that film.

A journey I thought I was prepared for but evidently was not. It exceeded every single expectation I had. I'd always felt like I'd seen the film cause I'd seen clips and knew what the deal was with it but it turns out I didn't know shit until last night lol. It really was everything people have said it was only you really you can't begin to understand until you've seen it and I now get that. \n\nI will 100% be watching it again and likely soon because although I watched it alone, I said to friends I was going to watch it and one who hasn't seen it said if I think it's worth watching, he'll watch it with me and obviously we all know that means he's going to be seeing it very soon haha. \n\nI'm rambling so I'll end with this. THANK YOU for the replies telling me to watch it. If I hadn't got them I likely would have put this off and I now know that I'd been putting it off for far too long. I wish my original 'review' didn't go missing as it was mostly done as soon as the film ended while I still had that super fresh amazement and a few drinks in me and definitely gave a better impression of how I felt but I really hope that what I've said here lets you know exactly how much I loved this film, and trust me it's a lot.\n\nIf anyone disagrees with the awesomeness that is The Room then leave your stupid comments in your pocket.\n\n\n10/10.

It's your average 90s martial arts movie aimed at young adults, riding the Karate Kid wake. BUT...the plot of this movie is nothing short of amazing. I'll summarize as best I can.\n\nThe main characters are 2 teenage brothers in L.A. One is your typical 90s white kid with frosted spiky hair, his adopted brother is Data from The Goonies. They don't know this yet, but their father is a bank robber, with a whole gang of stereotypical criminals that help him pull off some giant heist. They put a ridiculous amount of gold bars in an old bank vault, and get this... before destroying the vault keys, they make a mold by **pressing the keys into a god damn pizza** and then cutting up the pizza so it takes all of them to reproduce the keys. So the rest of the movie, all of these guys are literally killing each other for a piece of pizza. Then the kids get involved, they learn karate from their uncle, who **SWORE he would NEVER do karate again. EVER!** and then use the stupid techniques they learn from him to take down this crime ring ultimately leading to their dad. Oh and also, in one pivotal flashback scene, we learn that the father ended up being forced to adopt the Vietnamese kid after accidentally shooting his mother in 'Nam, because those are the rules....and he named him.... fucking.....Charlie.\n\n\nYou can probably still find copies of it in dvd bargain bins, that's where I found it, back in like 2001, at a Circuit City for $5. I got it because Bolo Yeung was on the cover, and the only name listed, (we used to have Bolo parties, and none of us had heard of this one before) when in reality he's in the movie for about 30 seconds. Also, the resolution of this movie is about fucking 19p. Everything is really pixelated and weird looking, there is a 3-minute fight sequence in a night club where the screen is just black, you can't make out anything that is happening, and it has this bizarre 3-question trivia about the movie, which is the only Special Feature on the dvd.\n\nEdit: The entire movie is on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/4S6gFv4Rguk).
