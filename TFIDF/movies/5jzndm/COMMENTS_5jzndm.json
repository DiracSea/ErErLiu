With that said, [American Hospital Association created a list of one word conditions that do not violate HIPAA.](http://www.webcitation.org/5VBWPbFgY) Below is a quote from the link that explains why stable should not be used.\n\n\n\n> Clinicians find the \"critical but stable\" term useful when discussing cases amongst themselves because it helps them differentiate patients who are expected to recover from those whose prognosis is worse.  But a critical condition means that at least some vital signs are unstable, so this is inherently contradictory.  The term \"stable\" should not be used as a condition. Furthermore, this term should not be used in combination with other conditions, which by definition, often indicate a patient is unstable.\n\n\n\nTo put it into a more basic context, the word stable means to not change. When a person is in the hospital they are either getting better or they are getting worse, there is no overall stable condition. Saying something isn't changing when in fact it is changing either for better or worse is very contradictory and misleading.
