We were walking around and we saw Stan walking with a bunch of suits. We asked to take a photo and he was so happy to meet us and take a photo with us. He was warm, kind and inviting. He talked to us while the executives stood their looking at their watches. He was genuinely happy to talk with us and spend that little time with us. \n\nTwo years later, we went to SDCC and printed that photo. We knew it was a long shot to run into him at SDCC, but we would be upset if we missed an opportunity. We found a booth that was hosting Stan. They had Spider-Man guitars and if you bought one, Stan would sign them. We get there and there is this huge crowd. Stan comes and starts signing. My wife and I take out the photo in the middle of the crowd and hold it up high. After 10 minutes or so of signing, surrounded by people holding comics up to get him to sign, he spots our photo. He smiles and waves, then leans over to one of the booth employees and says something to him. The guys comes through the crowd and asks my wife to follow him. She walks all the way up to Stan and he talks with her for a minute or two and signs the photo. His mannerisms were so different toward my wife than they were to the people getting the guitars because this was something that was special to us. It has no monetary value. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/kgnSLWt", "created_utc": 1542071320.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e9l9db9", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_9wgs9p", "parent_id": "t3_9wgs9p", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/9wgs9p/stan_lee_marvel_comics_reallife_superhero_dies_at/e9l9db9/", "score": 17, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "AuzRoxUrSox", "author_id": "y1fug", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Well shit, this is a horrible thing to read before going to bed", "created_utc": 1542049242.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "e9ki78f", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_9wgs9p", "parent_id": "t3_9wgs9p", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/9wgs9p/stan_lee_marvel_comics_reallife_superhero_dies_at/e9ki78f/", "score": 34, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "TunaNoodleMyFavorite", "author_id": "2bxg8ih5", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "What a life - dude got to see such an evolution of comics as an art form.

Though some with an intimate knowledge of the household speak of her vivacious spirit and kindness, the never-married J.C. also has a reputation as a prodigious shopper with an ill-tempered personality who has been kicked out of multiple businesses around Los Angeles, including, according to a dining companion at the time, the Chateau Marmont. She's chafed at what she sees as unjust restrictions on her trust and has taken that out on her father. According to medical personnel who have cared for Lee, J.C.'s badgering, often insulting phone calls to her father (which can number in the dozens a day and which, out of a mix of guilt and love, he nearly always answers) frequently leave him hoarse from fighting. \"For any little thing, she'll argue,\" says a former caregiver. \"She's very inconsiderate.\"\n\n>According to household staff and business associates, there have been times when J.C.'s verbal outbursts have turned physical. One incident took place in winter 2014, explains Lee's former business and asset manager Bradley J. Herman, after J.C. discovered that the new Jaguar convertible parked outside, which she thought had been purchased for her, was in fact only leased \u2014 and in her father's name. Herman, in Stan's office to handle some paperwork, recalls that the argument spiraled out of control after J.C. called her parents \"fucking stupid\" and Joanie told her the car was \"now [Joanie's.]\"\n\n\nI've always been a Stan Lee fan, but will admit I have never done much research into his personal life and honestly only knew about him from his movies and my only *here and there* searches.
