From 55-75, it\u2019s a modest 200-300 more than the high end 4K. It\u2019s only when you get up to the 82\u201d that you get a $1500 price jump. \n\nWhen they make 8K TVs, they are 100% acknowledging that there is NO 8K content. The reason they still make the TVs and sell them is the upscaling chip built in. This years Q900R has the best upscaler, and it uses machine learning and AI so it will only get better with time. At a larger size like 75\u201d, you will notice a difference with 8K. Whether that small amount of difference is worth it to you? That\u2019s for you to decide. Maybe go to a store like your local Best Buy (90% sure we\u2019re the only stores that display them right now) and take a look at one. \n\nKeep in mind you\u2019re not just paying for 8K, you\u2019re also getting the best in color quality and contrast for an LED tv. All these people saying that you can get a good 4K tv for $350 know nothing about picture quality outside of resolution. I\u2019ve seen a lot of shitty TVs that are technically 4K, but look like absolute shit because they\u2019re just cheap 4K panels with no good guts inside. There\u2019s a dozen different factors to look at that you can consider when looking at a Tv. \n\nSource: I am a Samsung home theater expert at Best Buy and a picture quality freak. But I\u2019m also realistic and know that not everyone needs the best quality.
