Each Harry Potter movie after Chamber of Secrets had pretty major flaws even though I still generally enjoyed them.\n\nDeathly Hallows pt. 1-2 was probably the most solid out of the Yates directed ones, but even with that he messed up the ending on pretty bad (voldey-dusting as opposed to body on the floor to prove he was actually gone for good)\n\n\nAs far as the fantastic beasts movies go, I'd say it's a combination of both.  Rowling needs a (better) script doctor since she really isnt a screenwriter, and they need to replace Yates with someone a bit less.... gray.\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: Getting a lot of comments on Prisoner of Azkaban.  The pretty major flaws were the big jump cuts in time where it felt like you were just watching clips and not an actual movie sometimes, and (more personal taste) that film is where things like the kids no longer wearing robes started which made things *feel* less magical.\n\n\nLike I said initially, overall I *do* like the movies.  There are definitely certain things I would change if I had such power though (namely the last 30-40 minutes of DH part 2, Ron being less of a joke, and Ginny being more than a pair of walmart pants).\n", "created_utc": 1550547827.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": 1550585584.0, "id": "egs0re8", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_as4v9a", "parent_id": "t1_egrxt4y", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/as4v9a/fantastic_beasts_3_loses_its_release_date_to/egs0re8/", "score": 1148, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Sirsilentbob423", "author_id": "b2qzt", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "He did great with every Potter movie *except* Deathly Hallows 2, IMO.

Because it doesn't feel like it was ever meant to be the 8th Harry Potter book when you see the play.

The problem isn't the script itself.  The problem is it being marketed as the 8th Harry Potter book.

You absolutely lose out on iconic moments from the books in this way, but if I may provide an example - I was pissed for years they cut out the St Mungo's plot and Neville's bit with his parents until my recent rewatch, and greatly appreciated how Neville's moment with Harry in the Room of Requirement prior to Umbridge sending the DA scattering communicated the exact same idea in a more immediate, personal way that drove the story forward without needing to stop the film dead in its tracks for some world building.\n\nCourse, he's also responsible for drastically cutting down the exploration of Voldemort's place in the world's history in 5 and his backstory in 6, which leaves both Deathly Hallows films with a weak, non-compelling villain.
