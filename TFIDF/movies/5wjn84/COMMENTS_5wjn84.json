Rather than an impossible utopia, an achievable heterotopia. Her struggle asked the question, \"If we surpass our physical form, what takes its place in forming our sense of identity?

To Hollywood, no. The process of replacing parts inherently destroys the specialness of the vessel. To GITS, yes, completely. It's even in the title. The Ghost is who you are, and the shell is just...well a shell. The specialness is independent of the shell. The Major body hops rather frequently in SAC to suit her purposes, for example, but is always herself. \n\nHumanity is the ultimate form: The current human body and the current human mind are, if you go by movies, absolutely perfect and any attempted deviation will inevitably produce horrific failure. Baseline modern humanity is inexplicably the pinnacle of evolution. GITS, as I think you pointed out, doesn't agree. At the end of the movie [the Major fuses with an AI to become more than human](#spoiler), and in most of the other incarnations we see all of society has become cyborgified to some extent. Even Togusa has a cyberbrain to enhance his memory and handle communications. Perhaps the best illustration of this is [the Jameson cyborgs](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DBGOhxwMr5A/hqdefault.jpg) - basically a box with little robo-corgi legs, just big enough to fit a brain inside. To Hollywood, this is a horrific perversion of the human form. Any person who would volunteer to become like that must be severely mentally ill. In GITS, wanting to be a Jameson is just an odd personal quirk, like wearing sunglasses in doors. There is nothing special about the human body in GITS' worldview, so if someone wants to live life as a 2 foot tall box on stilts who are we to disagree?\n\n\nThe role of technology: This one is the simplest, and most profound I think. To Hollywood, technology will damn us and in GITS it will save us. Of course there are counter-examples, but consider the extreme popularity of the robot uprising trope in movies. Or of technology taking on a life of its own and becoming malevolent. Again, contrast GITS. Our protagonist literally has her life saved through technology, and we see many examples over the franchise of people utilizing new tech to improve their lives. In Arise, the Major watches elderly people dancing happily in young people cyborg bodies and comments this is what the future holds. Even the geopolitics of the GITS world are built on this - Japan's pre-eminent place in global society was a product of the Japanese miracle, the invention of nano-robotics that can clean up radiation contaminated areas. The nano-robots don't go berserk and start eating people, they don't get turned into a deadly weapon, they don't turn sentient and demand humanity become their slaves - they just do their job, everyone wins, and life is awesome.
