It's so sad to hear he died so young... And in that way, all alone. \n\nI saw Charlie Bartlett just before I entered high school, and that was around the time I got a phone and a lot of my friends started talking to me about their depression and home issues. It may be kind of silly, but as a kid in high school I looked up to the character of Charlie for always being there for his friends and taking the time to genuinely and compassionately counsel them as best he could, especially where parents and school and society failed them. When I got weary (I had my own issues) I tried to emulate that. And of course the character was someone else's brainchild, but it seemed to me at least that Anton was the one who brought him to life, gave him the spark he needed to be beautiful. \n\nRest In Peace, Anton Yelchin.", "created_utc": 1466386594.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "d4g1yfk", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_4oucd2", "parent_id": "t3_4oucd2", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/4oucd2/star_trek_actor_anton_yelchin_dies_in_car_crash/d4g1yfk/", "score": 7, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "iswallowedarock", "author_id": "oh9x3", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "I worked on a pretty terrible indie with him two years ago and he was a bright spot in the whole experience.
