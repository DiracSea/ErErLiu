His effort was a film adaptation of the novel Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes. The documentary was shot in 2000 during Gilliam's first attempt to make the film, as an intended work of the genre known as the \"making-of\". But Gilliam's failure to complete his movie resulted in the documentary filmmakers retitling their work as Lost in la Mancha and releasing it independently.\n\nWritten and directed by Keith Fulton and Louis Pepe, Lost in La Mancha presents Gilliam's effort to make Don Quixote as a parallel to Quixote's quest to become a hero. It co-stars Johnny Depp, Jean Rochefort, and Vanessa Paradis, who were cast as stars for The Man Who Killed Don Quixote. It is narrated by Jeff Bridges. *\"", "created_utc": 1543646712.0, "distinguished": null, "edited": false, "id": "eau9pq4", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_a1zdl3", "parent_id": "t1_eau4mar", "permalink": "/r/movies/comments/a1zdl3/first_image_of_adam_driver_in_drama_the_torture/eau9pq4/", "score": 27, "stickied": false, "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh3s", "author_name": "Barghodi", "author_id": "pez09", "subreddit_name": "movies"}, {"body": "Kind of, but this iteration is fairly new.
